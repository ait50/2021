00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.150
Earlier, we discussed a basic optimization problem.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.505
It's possible for optimization problems to have an additional wrinkle.

00:00:08.505 --> 00:00:10.980
Constraints can be placed on the problem

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.880
to limit the region where you look for a solution.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.130
In other words, you try to find the smallest value of

00:00:17.129 --> 00:00:20.414
the function that also satisfies the constraints.

00:00:20.414 --> 00:00:24.524
Let's discuss how to solve an optimization problem with constraints.

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:27.750
First, let's clarify some terminology.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.394
The function we are trying to optimize is called the objective or cost function.

00:00:33.395 --> 00:00:36.140
The variable we are trying to optimize,

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.109
which in portfolio optimization is the vector

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:42.350
of weights on the various assets in the portfolio,

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.460
is called the optimization variable.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.204
Then we may have various constraints.

00:00:49.204 --> 00:00:54.414
The constraints can take the form of inequality or equality conditions.

00:00:54.414 --> 00:00:56.100
If there are no constraints,

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.835
we say the problem is unconstrained.

00:00:58.835 --> 00:01:03.380
If the objective function is x minus one squared plus one

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.644
and we apply the constraint that x must be less than or equal to zero,

00:01:07.644 --> 00:01:10.849
then the new minimum value is two because this is

00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:16.039
the smallest value of the function that also satisfies the constraint.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.930
A vector x is called optimal or a solution of the problem if it has

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.440
the smallest objective value among all vectors that satisfy the constraints.

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:29.614
The set of points for which the objective and

00:01:29.614 --> 00:01:35.214
all the constraint functions are defined is called the domain of the problem.

00:01:35.215 --> 00:01:41.170
A point in the domain is said to be feasible if it satisfies all the constraints.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.109
The problem is feasible if there exists at least one feasible point,

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:48.765
and it is infeasible otherwise.

00:01:48.765 --> 00:01:54.555
If there are feasible points for which the objective function reaches negative infinity,

00:01:54.555 --> 00:01:57.465
we say the problem is unbounded below.

00:01:57.465 --> 00:02:01.100
This is the case for the function f of x equals

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:05.024
the negative natural log of x with no constraints.

00:02:05.025 --> 00:02:09.125
A general optimization problem can be very difficult to solve.

00:02:09.125 --> 00:02:11.539
You can have functions of many variables and

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:14.924
the objective function and constraints can be very complicated.

00:02:14.925 --> 00:02:19.555
So, instead of thinking about how to solve all types of optimization problems,

00:02:19.555 --> 00:02:22.379
let's just think about how to solve certain types.

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:27.439
It turns out that there are well developed methods to solve some sub-types of problems,

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:31.724
and they will be of great help to us as we try to optimize our portfolios.

00:02:31.724 --> 00:02:36.400
It turns out that a very important type of optimization problem is one for which

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.004
the objective function and inequality constraints are convex.

00:02:41.004 --> 00:02:44.829
What does that mean? Well, it's actually very intuitive.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.549
A convex function curves upward everywhere.

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.700
Any straight line you draw between two points

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:55.144
on the function has to lie above the function.

00:02:55.145 --> 00:02:58.659
So, this wiggly function would not be convex.

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:04.805
An important property of a convex optimization problem is that it only has one minimum.

00:03:04.805 --> 00:03:06.879
So, if you find a local minimum,

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:11.344
you know it is the globally optimal value over the whole feasible region.

00:03:11.344 --> 00:03:13.620
This is actually hugely helpful.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.289
When the objective function and inequality constraints are convex and

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:24.250
the equality constraints have the form f of x equals a times x plus b,

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.824
the optimization problem is called a convex optimization problem.

00:03:28.824 --> 00:03:31.669
If you find a local optimum for this problem,

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.979
you know it is a global optimum.

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:37.500
There are well developed techniques for solving these problems,

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.830
and the set of problems we deal with during

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.820
portfolio optimization will generally be of this type.
