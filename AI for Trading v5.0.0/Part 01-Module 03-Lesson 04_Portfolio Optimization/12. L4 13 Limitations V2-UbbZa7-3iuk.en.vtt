00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
So far we've learned a few common ways to

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.515
formulate and solve a portfolio optimization problem.

00:00:06.514 --> 00:00:10.785
But there are a number of practical limitations to these methods.

00:00:10.785 --> 00:00:16.289
First of all, mean returns are notoriously difficult to estimate accurately.

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.704
Past returns are frequently poor estimates of future returns.

00:00:20.704 --> 00:00:22.829
To mitigate this problem,

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:27.414
people frequently avoid estimating returns directly altogether.

00:00:27.414 --> 00:00:32.195
We've already introduced one possible solution which is to simply minimize

00:00:32.195 --> 00:00:37.250
the difference between your portfolio weights and another set of target weights.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.634
Another technique is to use an alternative quantity thought to be predictive

00:00:42.634 --> 00:00:47.739
of future returns as a substitute for actual returns value estimates.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.410
We're going to talk more about these methods in a future lesson.

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:57.724
There are also problems inherent to the estimation of portfolio variance.

00:00:57.725 --> 00:01:02.320
The first is that variants may not be a good enough measure of risk.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.605
This is the theme that might come up whenever you rely upon variants to estimate risk.

00:01:08.605 --> 00:01:10.725
To understand what I mean,

00:01:10.724 --> 00:01:13.289
think about the distribution of log returns.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.719
If the distribution has a different shape on the left side and on the right,

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:20.000
this means there's a different probability of getting

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.560
very high positive returns than getting very high negative returns,

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.780
but mean and standard deviation won't tell you about this asymmetry.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.165
For example, these two distributions have the same mean and the same standard deviation,

00:01:35.165 --> 00:01:37.575
but obviously very different shapes.

00:01:37.575 --> 00:01:39.600
As a quantitative trader,

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:43.699
you really care about the shape of that negative tail because that part of

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.760
the distribution tells you how likely you are to get large negative returns.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.829
As a workaround for this,

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:55.209
you can formulate your optimization problem using alternative measures of risk,

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:58.459
some of which we'll discuss in future lessons.

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:03.659
Furthermore, the need to estimate an n by n covariance matrix,

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.644
where n is the number of assets in your portfolio,

00:02:06.644 --> 00:02:10.384
means the problem size grows very quickly as the number of

00:02:10.384 --> 00:02:14.564
assets increases and the matrix becomes very large.

00:02:14.564 --> 00:02:18.079
Estimating large numbers of parameters introduces

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.460
the possibility of aggregating many estimation errors.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.805
When the number of stocks n is of the same order of magnitude

00:02:25.805 --> 00:02:30.885
as the number of historical return data points per stock t,

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:35.359
the total number of parameters to estimate in the covariance matrix is of

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.365
the same order as the total size of the dataset, which is problematic.

00:02:40.365 --> 00:02:44.360
The need for a covariance matrix also means that we need to have

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.525
a long enough historical stock price dataset

00:02:47.525 --> 00:02:51.260
to produce reliable estimates of covariances.

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:54.829
For example, estimating a covariance matrix of

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.215
50 assets requires at least five years of daily data.

00:02:59.215 --> 00:03:02.210
If there are not enough daily return data,

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.784
estimates of variances and covariances will not be accurate.

00:03:05.784 --> 00:03:08.840
But in fact any estimate is noisy.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.865
How do you handle noise?

00:03:10.865 --> 00:03:14.960
Well, instead of using raw values of quantities like means,

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.040
you can utilize their ranks so that you only keep track of their relative magnitude.

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:26.479
You can also simply include a term in the objective function to penalize turnover.

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:30.060
This means that by default you are less likely to trade,

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.574
therefore your results will be less reactive to noise.

00:03:33.574 --> 00:03:37.084
Finally, there's a method called robust optimization

00:03:37.085 --> 00:03:41.120
which takes into account confidence intervals of estimates.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.170
Another issue which we discussed when we mentioned rebalancing is

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:47.959
that portfolio optimization is typically done

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.080
using a chunk of data from some time period,

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.890
but then needs to be performed again as time passes and things change.

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:00.094
In other words, the optimized weights are really only valid as long

00:04:00.094 --> 00:04:04.504
as the estimates of the parameters fed into the problem are accurate.

00:04:04.504 --> 00:04:08.555
There's no built-in way to account for change over time.

00:04:08.555 --> 00:04:12.050
But the changing nature of the stock market may

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.775
lead to conflicting predictions over different time horizons.

00:04:15.775 --> 00:04:18.860
For example, what if your analysis tells you that

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.934
a return over one day horizon will be positive,

00:04:21.934 --> 00:04:25.060
but over a one month horizon it will be negative?

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.129
In a single period optimization framework,

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:29.990
it's not clear how to account for

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.345
the different timescales while taking into account the conflicting predictions.

00:04:34.345 --> 00:04:38.765
One approach to account for the changing nature of the stock market over time

00:04:38.764 --> 00:04:43.430
as part of optimization is called multi-period optimization.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.900
In essence, this involves modeling a plan for trading over

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:50.269
the next several periods of time using

00:04:50.269 --> 00:04:53.509
the best information available at the current time,

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:55.550
and optimizing over this series of

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.074
future trades but only ever executing the trades for the first period.

00:05:00.074 --> 00:05:02.914
This basically amounts to a planning exercise,

00:05:02.915 --> 00:05:06.050
the idea is simply to try to ensure that we don't place

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.210
any traits now that will put us in a bad position in the future.

00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:12.144
In the example I just mentioned,

00:05:12.144 --> 00:05:15.704
where we have a prediction that returns over one day will be positive,

00:05:15.704 --> 00:05:18.125
returns over one month will be negative,

00:05:18.125 --> 00:05:20.899
we can see intuitively that it makes sense to go

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:24.504
long and short to take advantage of these predictions,

00:05:24.504 --> 00:05:31.230
if transaction costs are low but to refrain from trading if transaction costs are high.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.105
If transaction costs are high,

00:05:33.105 --> 00:05:36.245
we may waste more money making trades than we could

00:05:36.245 --> 00:05:40.470
gain by following the predictions of positive and negative returns.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.880
A multi-period optimization analysis that includes

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:48.344
transaction costs would provide an optimal solution to this problem.

00:05:48.345 --> 00:05:51.500
Another difficulty of portfolio optimization is

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.884
the ambiguity about how to deal with transaction costs.

00:05:54.884 --> 00:05:58.214
Every time we make trades to rebalance the portfolio,

00:05:58.214 --> 00:05:59.959
we incur trading costs.

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:03.339
But in general, they're difficult to precisely model.

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:05.264
In order to account for them,

00:06:05.264 --> 00:06:08.680
we model them as being proportional to turn over,

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.269
the sum total of changes and portfolio weights.

00:06:12.269 --> 00:06:17.904
But you can also include measures of turnover in the optimization problem formulation,

00:06:17.904 --> 00:06:19.424
either as a constraint,

00:06:19.425 --> 00:06:23.210
or as a term to minimize in the objective function.

00:06:23.209 --> 00:06:25.849
To address some of these weaknesses,

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.300
factor-based models of risk are often seen as more

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.925
practical but if this discussion seem rather abstract to you, just hang on.

00:06:33.925 --> 00:06:37.870
Many of these topics will be elaborated upon in a future lesson.
