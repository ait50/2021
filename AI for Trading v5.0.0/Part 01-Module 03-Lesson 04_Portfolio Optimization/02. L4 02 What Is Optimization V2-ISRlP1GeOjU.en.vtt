00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
Previously, we studied the set of all portfolios and we know we're particularly

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.199
interested in portfolios with

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.509
the highest possible return given the volatility in returns.

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:14.330
How do we find the highest returns then?

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.429
Well, this is a type of problem known as an Optimization Problem,

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:20.684
you may have encountered this before.

00:00:20.684 --> 00:00:25.494
Intuitively optimization means making something the best possible right?

00:00:25.495 --> 00:00:29.780
So, what we're trying to do is find the maximum or minimum of a function.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.840
In fact, we can always turn a maximization problem into

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.230
a minimization one by optimizing the negative of the function.

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:41.019
So, we can say that optimization involves,

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.770
trying to find the minimum of a function.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.455
First, let's look at a simple example of a type you may have seen before,

00:00:48.454 --> 00:00:54.394
here we're looking at the function Y equals X minus one squared plus one.

00:00:54.395 --> 00:00:56.720
This is a quadratic function of

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:02.320
one variable X so we know it looks like an upside down U shape a Parabola.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.079
We can see that all we have to do to find the location of

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:10.054
that minimum is to find the value of X that makes Y the smallest.

00:01:10.055 --> 00:01:15.100
We will find that point by observing that the graph has a special property at that point.

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:20.269
At every other point on the line seems to be either going down or going up,

00:01:20.269 --> 00:01:23.509
but at that point the line looks basically horizontal.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.135
What I'm saying is that every other point

00:01:26.135 --> 00:01:30.800
the instantaneous slope of the line is some positive or negative number,

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.534
but at that minimum the instantaneous slope of the line is 0.

00:01:34.534 --> 00:01:37.489
That is how we will find the point.

00:01:37.489 --> 00:01:41.359
Now, let's remember that we know how to get an equation that

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:45.515
represents the instantaneous slope of the function, the derivative.

00:01:45.515 --> 00:01:50.769
So, what we can do to solve for the value of X at this point mathematically,

00:01:50.769 --> 00:01:53.239
is to take the derivative of the function,

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:55.670
set it equal to 0 and solve for X,

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.329
so let's do that now.

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.364
And check it out we got that x equals one,

00:02:01.364 --> 00:02:07.295
this is one very basic type of optimization problem that can be solved exactly.

00:02:07.295 --> 00:02:11.090
Later on, we'll see that there are many complexities we can add to

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.599
an optimization problem and we'll require many more methods to solve them. Stay tuned.
