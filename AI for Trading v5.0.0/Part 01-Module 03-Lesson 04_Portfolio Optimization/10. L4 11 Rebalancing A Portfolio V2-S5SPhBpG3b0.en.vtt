00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.075
So far in this lesson,

00:00:02.075 --> 00:00:03.165
you've learned how to use

00:00:03.165 --> 00:00:07.115
optimization techniques to come up with optimal portfolio weights.

00:00:07.115 --> 00:00:10.315
Is your job done? Not really.

00:00:10.314 --> 00:00:11.779
As a portfolio manager,

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:14.399
the next step after portfolio construction,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.980
is to constantly monitor your portfolio,

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.625
and make sure it is in line with your goals.

00:00:19.625 --> 00:00:24.795
Over time, assets produce returns that can differ from those originally estimated.

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:28.794
So, the amount of money invested in different assets, changes.

00:00:28.794 --> 00:00:31.250
Therefore, the portfolio weights,

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.435
which represent the proportion of money invested in each asset, change.

00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:40.859
In order to make sure the portfolio maintains the desired set of weights,

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:42.714
we need two rebalance.

00:00:42.715 --> 00:00:47.705
For example, say we started with a strategy in which we wanted to invest

00:00:47.704 --> 00:00:53.585
50% of our portfolio in a solar energy company and 50% in a construction company.

00:00:53.585 --> 00:00:56.945
Let's say the solar energy company does really well

00:00:56.945 --> 00:01:00.170
and it's value appreciates such that the shares we've invested in it,

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.019
now represent 70% of the value of our portfolio.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.399
If we wanted to return to the 50% in

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.685
a solar energy company and 50% in the construction company,

00:01:10.685 --> 00:01:13.609
we'd sell some shares of the solar energy company,

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:18.769
and buy some shares of the construction company to bring us back to 50-50.

00:01:18.769 --> 00:01:21.560
When you have determined your portfolio weights

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.680
via optimization and later want to rebalance,

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.070
you simply re-run the optimization with the same objective function and constraints,

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:32.184
but using updated data.

00:01:32.185 --> 00:01:35.600
Before we discuss different rebalancing strategies,

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:38.939
let's consider the costs incurred during rebalancing.

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.899
Think about it, when you rebalance, you place trades.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.255
To place trades, you generally have to pay a broker commissions.

00:01:47.254 --> 00:01:50.824
These commissions are one type of transaction costs.

00:01:50.825 --> 00:01:55.935
Transaction costs, are probably the most important costs incurred during rebalancing.

00:01:55.935 --> 00:01:58.560
But, there are others, such as taxes,

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.945
like capital gains taxes and the administrative costs of time and labor.

00:02:03.944 --> 00:02:07.625
Transaction costs can be potentially significant.

00:02:07.625 --> 00:02:09.284
In the year 2000,

00:02:09.284 --> 00:02:13.340
the Texas Permanent School Fund rebalanced its portfolio of

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.560
more than 2,000 securities, 40 portfolio managers,

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.890
500 million shares, and $17.5 billion were involved not including administrative costs,

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:28.654
the transactions themselves costs $120 million.

00:02:28.655 --> 00:02:32.750
Now, you can see how crazy transaction costs can be.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.639
In general, it's hard to model transaction costs directly.

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:39.489
To know the transaction costs,

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.314
you must know what the trade is.

00:02:41.314 --> 00:02:43.664
But the whole reason to do the optimization,

00:02:43.664 --> 00:02:45.584
is to know what the trade is.

00:02:45.585 --> 00:02:49.075
So, instead of trying to estimate transaction costs,

00:02:49.074 --> 00:02:52.144
we can make the assumption that transaction costs will be

00:02:52.145 --> 00:02:56.165
proportional to the magnitude of change in the holdings.

00:02:56.164 --> 00:03:00.229
This is called portfolio turnover and it's basically,

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:04.664
the sum total of the changes in the weights on all the assets.

00:03:04.664 --> 00:03:08.870
To calculate turnover between two time periods,

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.599
you would take the absolute value of

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:16.454
the difference in weight between two time periods for each asset,

00:03:16.455 --> 00:03:19.040
and then sum these over assets.

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:21.780
To get an annualized turnover,

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.125
you would calculate the average turnover per rebalancing event by calculating,

00:03:27.125 --> 00:03:31.365
total turnover for all the rebalancing events in the timeframe you're considering,

00:03:31.365 --> 00:03:35.094
and dividing by the number of rebalancing events,

00:03:35.094 --> 00:03:40.469
and then multiplying by the number of rebalancing events per year.
