Hey now, you made it,

00:00:02.154 --> 00:00:04.000
and you are doing awesome.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.384
We talked about a lot in this lesson.

00:00:06.384 --> 00:00:10.050
We learned about a very important method for distributing money amongst

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.140
several assets in a manner that maximizes return and minimizes risk.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.175
This knowledge will serve you well when you're deciding how to best invest your money.

00:00:19.175 --> 00:00:21.365
I really hope you enjoy the project.

00:00:21.364 --> 00:00:25.125
It's a great opportunity to cement what you've learned in memory.

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:27.879
Looking forward to seeing you in the next module.
