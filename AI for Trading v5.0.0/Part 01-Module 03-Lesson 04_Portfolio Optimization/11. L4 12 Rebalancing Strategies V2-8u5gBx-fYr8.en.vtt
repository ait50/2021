00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.805
In the last video, we discussed the purpose of rebalancing,

00:00:03.805 --> 00:00:06.165
costs incurred during rebalancing,

00:00:06.165 --> 00:00:09.835
and we also chatted about a way to estimate those costs.

00:00:09.835 --> 00:00:12.795
But how do you know when to rebalance a portfolio?

00:00:12.794 --> 00:00:16.829
There are two types of events that trigger the rebalancing decision,

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:22.269
cash flows and changes in the underlying parameters of the stock return model.

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:26.994
Cash flows are movements of money into and out of a portfolio.

00:00:26.995 --> 00:00:29.155
For a portfolio of stocks,

00:00:29.155 --> 00:00:32.304
the most common forms of cash flows are dividends,

00:00:32.304 --> 00:00:34.945
capital gains and new contributions.

00:00:34.945 --> 00:00:40.000
For example, an investor receives dividend payments when he loans a stock.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.409
However, when he has shorted a stock,

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:46.474
he is obligated to pay the balance of dividend payments

00:00:46.475 --> 00:00:51.200
issued to shareholders to the person who has loaned him the stock.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.109
Capital gains and losses are the increases or

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:57.579
decreases in value of the assets in the portfolio,

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.460
but these are unrealized until the assets are sold at

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.439
which time they become realized capital gains and contribute to cash flows.

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:13.019
New contributions consist of new investments in the fund or portfolio under management.

00:01:13.019 --> 00:01:16.609
The simplest way to adjust for cash flows is to

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:20.349
buy and sell stocks using the current portfolio weights,

00:01:20.349 --> 00:01:24.234
but when some assets appreciate and some depreciate,

00:01:24.234 --> 00:01:30.769
the weights which represent the fraction of the portfolio invested in each asset change.

00:01:30.769 --> 00:01:35.769
A portfolio manager can take advantage of cash flows to adjust the under

00:01:35.769 --> 00:01:41.479
weighted or over weighted portfolios to return to the target asset allocation.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.400
Changes in model parameters do not automatically trigger rebalancing.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.080
In this case, the portfolio manager must decide whether the parameter change is

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.890
large enough to warrant incurring transaction costs to rebalance.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.000
As a portfolio manager,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.730
you need to constantly monitor the parameters used

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.335
in your portfolio and be ready to rebalance when needed.

00:02:04.334 --> 00:02:06.919
Parameters can change at anytime.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.509
For example, many types of corporate actions such as mergers and

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.454
acquisitions or changes in management may impact the model's parameters.

00:02:15.455 --> 00:02:19.170
When a portfolio manager suspects that a parameter has changed,

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:23.059
she will re-estimate the model to come up with the optimal weights,

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.039
then she will decide if the portfolio should be rebalanced by

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:31.864
weighing the benefits of rebalancing with the downsides such as transaction costs.

00:02:31.865 --> 00:02:34.990
The most common rebalancing strategies are

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.254
based on rebalancing at set temporal frequencies,

00:02:38.254 --> 00:02:43.310
or rebalancing when portfolio weights change by a certain threshold amount.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.894
One strategy is to rebalance at a set temporal frequency, daily, monthly,

00:02:48.894 --> 00:02:51.875
quarterly, annually or at another frequency,

00:02:51.875 --> 00:02:56.134
regardless of the changes in the sizes of the portfolio weights.

00:02:56.134 --> 00:03:03.324
This temporal frequency typically comes from the original time horizon of optimization.

00:03:03.324 --> 00:03:06.319
When a portfolio manager models his portfolio,

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:11.349
he will often optimize it using data from a chunk of time of some duration.

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.849
For example, if a portfolio is model based on month long chunks of data,

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:21.875
the optimal weights are only valid for a month and so rebalancing is performed monthly.

00:03:21.875 --> 00:03:25.009
The threshold base strategy calls for rebalancing

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:27.935
the portfolio only when the portfolio weights have

00:03:27.935 --> 00:03:34.449
drifted from the target ones by a predetermined threshold such as 1%, 5% or 10%.

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:38.599
Since rebalancing does not occur at predetermined times,

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.489
it can happen as frequently as daily,

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.400
but also as infrequently as yearly.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.984
These strategies can also be combined,

00:03:45.984 --> 00:03:49.969
such that rebalancing is performed on a scheduled basis but only when

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:54.449
the portfolio weights have drifted from the target ones by a predetermined threshold,

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:57.560
thus, both criteria must be fulfilled.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.810
On the scheduled rebalancing date,

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.620
if the change in the portfolio weights is less than the threshold,

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.539
rebalancing won't be performed.

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:08.389
Also, if the portfolio weights drift by

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:11.299
more than the threshold before the scheduled rebalancing date,

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.530
rebalancing won't be performed.
