00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.975
So, let's start with an example.

00:00:01.975 --> 00:00:03.400
Let's say we're in charge of writing

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:07.570
the recommendation engine for the App Store or for Google play.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.544
Our task is to recommend to people the app they're most likely to download,

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:13.870
and we should do this based on previous data.

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:17.195
Our previous data is this table with six people each in a row,

00:00:17.195 --> 00:00:20.060
and the columns are their gender, male or female,

00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:22.554
their occupation, work or study,

00:00:22.554 --> 00:00:24.070
and the app they downloaded.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.094
The options for the app are Pokemon Go, WhatsApp, and Snapchat.

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:32.325
So, the model we'll create will take the first two columns and guess the third one.

00:00:32.325 --> 00:00:37.105
So let's start with some small quizzes to test our intuition with this data.

00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:40.704
The first quiz is the following: if we have a woman who works at an office,

00:00:40.704 --> 00:00:42.725
what app should we recommend to her,

00:00:42.725 --> 00:00:46.530
Pokemon Go, WhatsApp, or Snapchat?

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.914
The second quiz is the following: if we have a man who works at a factory,

00:00:49.914 --> 00:00:52.064
what app should we recommend to him?

00:00:52.064 --> 00:00:53.649
And the third one says, if we have a girl

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:55.795
who's in high school, what app do we recommend to her?

00:00:55.795 --> 00:00:57.270
