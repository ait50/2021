00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.375
Okay. Well, let's see what happens if we split them by gender.

00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:04.980
If we split them by gender,

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.725
we see that the women downloaded WhatsApp and Pokemon Go,

00:00:07.724 --> 00:00:10.455
while the men downloaded Snapchat and Pokemon Go.

00:00:10.455 --> 00:00:13.169
This tells us a bit, but not much.

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:15.689
On the other hand, if split by occupation,

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:18.179
we can see that the students all downloaded Pokemon Go,

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:20.864
whereas, the people who work downloaded other apps.

00:00:20.864 --> 00:00:23.759
This is a good piece of information since from now on,

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.230
whenever a student comes in,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.105
we'll recommend them Pokemon Go.

00:00:27.105 --> 00:00:29.490
Thus, occupation is a better feature

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:32.320
here for predicting what app will the users download.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.774
So, we can go ahead and make that decision.

00:00:34.774 --> 00:00:37.902
We'll do it by creating a node here that says,

00:00:37.902 --> 00:00:39.769
"To everybody that goes to school,

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.660
we'll recommend Pokemon Go.

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:44.614
And for the ones that work, let's see."

00:00:44.615 --> 00:00:46.520
If we forget about the students,

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.020
now will look at the people who work.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.109
And now, it turns out that the gender split will help us.

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:53.464
Because the women downloaded WhatsApp,

00:00:53.465 --> 00:00:55.520
and the men downloaded Snapchat.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.520
So, let's do that. Let's add another node here.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.025
The new node says "If you work,

00:01:01.024 --> 00:01:02.464
then I'll ask for your gender.

00:01:02.465 --> 00:01:04.850
And if the gender is female, we'll recommend WhatsApp.

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:06.169
And if the gender is male,

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.590
we'll recommend Snapchat." And we're done.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.725
So quick summary. If we got a student,

00:01:10.724 --> 00:01:12.584
well recommend them Pokemon Go.

00:01:12.584 --> 00:01:15.224
If we get someone who works, we'll ask for the gender.

00:01:15.224 --> 00:01:18.149
If it's a woman, we'll recommend her WhatsApp.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.305
And if it's a man,

00:01:19.305 --> 00:01:21.705
we'll recommend him Snapchat.

00:01:21.704 --> 00:01:24.539
Now, what we need to figure out is,

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.359
how do we get the computer to measure the two features,

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:33.129
and figure out that occupation is a better feature to split by? We will learn that later.
