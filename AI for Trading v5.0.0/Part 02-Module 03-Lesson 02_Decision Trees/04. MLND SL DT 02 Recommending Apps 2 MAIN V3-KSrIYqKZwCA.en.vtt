00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.805
Well, let's see. A woman who works at an office.

00:00:02.805 --> 00:00:07.050
In the table, there's two women who work and both downloaded WhatsApp.

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.632
So, let's say, it's safe to assume that

00:00:08.632 --> 00:00:11.410
recommending WhatsApp to this new person is the best idea.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.470
Now, for the man who works at a factory,

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:18.524
we'll see that there's another man in the table who works and he downloaded Snapchat.

00:00:18.524 --> 00:00:21.629
So, we'll proceed to recommend Snapchat to the new person.

00:00:21.629 --> 00:00:24.125
And finally, the girl that is in high school.

00:00:24.125 --> 00:00:26.344
Well, we see that in the table,

00:00:26.344 --> 00:00:29.689
there are three students and they all downloaded Pokemon Go.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.120
So, we'll go ahead and recommend Pokemon Go to this new person.

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:35.024
But now, that's how a human thinks.

00:00:35.024 --> 00:00:37.500
For the computer, it's harder to repeat this procedure.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.820
However, the computer can ask

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.189
a slightly more technical question like this one: between gender and occupation,

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:48.734
which one seems more decisive for predicting what app will the users download?

00:00:48.734 --> 00:00:51.329
This question sounds slightly ambiguous, but if you think about it,

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.000
the answer does make sense. Let's give it a try.
