Hello, and welcome to the Decision Trees section.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.070
Let me introduce the concept of decision trees by

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.015
playing this fun game on the Internet. It's called the Akinator.

00:00:08.015 --> 00:00:11.955
And the way it works is the genie will ask you questions about some character,

00:00:11.955 --> 00:00:14.879
and based on these questions, it'll guess who it is.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.470
The questions, as you can see,

00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:20.719
will get more and more educated as the genie narrowed down who the person is.

00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:23.549
This is the exact same thing decisions trees do.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.640
They ask you questions and questions about the data until they narrow

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.850
the information down well enough to make a prediction.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.100
So let's play it, and I'll choose one of my favorite character from history,

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.234
the great mathematician Hypatia.

00:00:35.234 --> 00:00:37.664
And here we have her Wikipedia page to help us out,

00:00:37.664 --> 00:00:39.935
so let's start answering questions.

00:00:39.935 --> 00:00:43.080
First question, is your character an adult man?

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.869
Nope. Is your character older than 18?

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:47.599
Yes, way older than 18.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.740
Has your character ever been pregnant?

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.895
Well, it says there were no kids known,

00:00:51.895 --> 00:00:54.480
so I'm going to go for no. Is your character a YouTuber?

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:56.000
Well, she would have been a wonderful Youtuber,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.225
but she was born way before Youtube was a thing, so no.

00:01:00.225 --> 00:01:03.480
Has your character recorded any albums? Again, no.

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:05.414
Does your character have a cell phone?

00:01:05.415 --> 00:01:08.015
Nope, way before cell phones.

00:01:08.015 --> 00:01:09.504
Has your character really existed?

00:01:09.504 --> 00:01:12.800
Of course. Is your character a citizen of the United States?

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.480
Nope, she was Egyptian.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.900
Has your character ever been married?

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.160
Well, Wikipedia is not sure,

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.254
so I'm going to go for a 'don't know'.

00:01:20.254 --> 00:01:23.484
Has your character been dead for more than a hundred years?

00:01:23.484 --> 00:01:25.864
Yes, way more than a hundred years.

00:01:25.864 --> 00:01:27.309
Is your character in the Bible?

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.400
No. Is your character an orphan?

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.165
I don't think so. Her dad was known, so no.

00:01:34.165 --> 00:01:36.025
Is your character European?

00:01:36.025 --> 00:01:40.780
Well, she was in the Roman Empire but she was born in Egypt,

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.435
so I'm going to go for no.

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:45.250
Is your character from Eastern Europe? Again, no.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.920
Oh, we're getting there. Is your character Egyptian?

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.100
Yes. Is your character obsessed with waffles?

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:53.500
No. Is your character a woman?

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.810
Yes. Did your character know Cleopatra?

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.185
Well, they didn't live in the same period of time, so no.

00:02:00.185 --> 00:02:03.310
Was your character a Pharaoh? No, she wasn't.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.609
Does your character live in Utah?

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:08.939
No. Is your character a queen?

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:11.544
No, she was a great mathematician but not a queen.

00:02:11.544 --> 00:02:13.164
Was your character a murderer?

00:02:13.164 --> 00:02:15.039
Yes, she was brutally murdered.

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:17.439
Is your character a princess?

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:20.109
No. Can your character cast spells?

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.875
No. Is your character bad? No, she was very good.

00:02:23.875 --> 00:02:25.599
Oh, and the genie did it.

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.949
He found the Hypatia of Alexandria. Good job, genie.

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:31.869
The way decision trees work is very similar to these examples.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.000
So, let's dive deeper into them and learn how they work and how they get built.
