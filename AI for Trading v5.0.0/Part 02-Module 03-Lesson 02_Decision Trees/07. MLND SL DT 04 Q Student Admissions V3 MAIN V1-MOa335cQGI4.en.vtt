00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.470
Now, in the last example,

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:03.960
we constructed a tree with categorical features,

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.120
namely gender and occupation,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.000
but we can also create a tree with continuous features.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.349
Let's go to this example,

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.570
which you may see in other parts of this class.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.949
The example is an Admissions Office which takes two pieces of data from the students,

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.724
their score in a test and their grades,

00:00:19.725 --> 00:00:21.420
and the better they do on them,

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.030
the more likely that they'll be accepted at a university.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.870
So in here, the blue points are accepted and the red points are rejected,

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.464
and our model will have the task of determining

00:00:30.464 --> 00:00:33.704
a rule for future students to be accepted or rejected.

00:00:33.704 --> 00:00:35.820
So, let's ask the same question as before.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.484
Between grades and tests,

00:00:37.484 --> 00:00:40.350
which one determines student acceptance better?

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.820
And in order to help you out,

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.685
let me translate this sentence into graphical terms.

00:00:44.685 --> 00:00:48.900
Since test is the horizontal axis and grades is the vertical axis,

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.280
then the question becomes,

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.445
between a horizontal and a vertical line,

00:00:53.445 --> 00:00:56.414
which one would cut the data in a better way,

00:00:56.414 --> 00:01:02.799
namely separating the red and the blue points as much as possible? Give this one a try.
