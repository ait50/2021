00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
Correct logarithm is the answer since it satisfies that beautiful identity that says,

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.385
the logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms.

00:00:08.385 --> 00:00:12.390
Thus, our product numbers becomes a sum of the logarithms of the numbers.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.100
In this case, we get minus 3.245.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.490
Now in this class, we'll be using log as a logarithm base two,

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.500
and the reason is information theory.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.730
So here's our summary. We have our three configuration of red and blue balls.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.090
Now we have the probability of the ball being red and blue,

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.250
and the product of them according to the sequence,

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.315
which is the probability of winning the game.

00:00:34.315 --> 00:00:37.085
In the next column, we'll take the logarithm base two.

00:00:37.085 --> 00:00:38.840
But since the numbers are less than one,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.055
the logarithm is negative.

00:00:40.055 --> 00:00:42.605
Thus, if we take the negative of the whole equation,

00:00:42.605 --> 00:00:44.600
we're now dealing with positive numbers.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.970
And in the last column, we'll just divide by four

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.180
because what we'll use as definition of entropy is the average of

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.970
the negatives of the logarithms of the probabilities

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.045
of picking the balls in a way that we win the game.

00:00:56.045 --> 00:00:57.830
Thus, for the first bucket,

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:58.985
we get 0 entropy,

00:00:58.985 --> 00:01:01.205
for the second one we get 0.81,

00:01:01.205 --> 00:01:03.290
and for the third one we get one.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.870
This is going to be our formula for entropy.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.670
In the slightly more general case of

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.490
five red balls and three blue balls, we get the following.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.410
The negative of the sum of

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.770
five times the logarithm of the probability of picking a red ball,

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.850
which is five over eight,

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.510
and three times the logarithm of the probability of picking a blue ball,

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.085
which is three over eight.

00:01:22.085 --> 00:01:25.670
We can see that this is a large number since this set has a lot of entropy.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.705
In the more general case with m red balls and n blue balls, this is the formula.

00:01:29.705 --> 00:01:34.685
As the probability of picking a red ball is m divided by m plus n,

00:01:34.685 --> 00:01:37.580
and for a blue ball it's n divided by n plus

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.130
n. And this is the general formula for entropy when the balls can be of two colors.
