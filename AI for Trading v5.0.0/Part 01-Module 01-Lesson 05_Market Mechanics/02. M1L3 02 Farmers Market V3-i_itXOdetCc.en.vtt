This is Betty. She sells the best fruit.

00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:06.365
Let's ask her how she decides what price to sell at.

00:00:06.365 --> 00:00:07.120
Good morning.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.839
Morning. So, if you don't mind me asking,

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:13.064
I was wondering how do you choose the prices for your oranges.

00:00:13.064 --> 00:00:15.709
Sometimes I see they're selling at two bucks a pound,

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.795
some days they're four bucks a pound, what's going on?

00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:22.810
Well, I obviously try to cover my costs and then keeps some profit.

00:00:22.809 --> 00:00:24.329
That gives me a starting point.

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:26.489
Sometimes people will buy it at that price which

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:28.500
makes me think I could get a bit more money for them.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.280
So, I bump up the price a little bit.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.730
If I don't see anyone buying,

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.189
I might lower the price later in the day.

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:38.754
Does that always work or do people come back and bargain with you as well?

00:00:38.755 --> 00:00:40.640
Yes, all the time.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.134
They'll often want to pay a lower price and then I tell them what price I can sell at,

00:00:45.134 --> 00:00:46.674
and we come to a middle ground.

00:00:46.674 --> 00:00:48.890
Some people are smart. They'll ask around what

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.715
prices others are selling it and then pick the lowest price.

00:00:51.715 --> 00:00:55.090
Eventually, we`re all forced to sell at that lowest price.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.835
I see. So, the prices of oranges are set by actual transactions,

00:00:59.835 --> 00:01:02.630
like the maximum price a buyer is willing to buy

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.495
at and the minimum price the seller is willing to sell at?

00:01:05.495 --> 00:01:07.280
You got it,
