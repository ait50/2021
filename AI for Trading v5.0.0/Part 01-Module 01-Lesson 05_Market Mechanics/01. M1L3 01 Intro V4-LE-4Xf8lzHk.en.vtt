00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
This lesson will introduce you to the mechanics behind modern-day stock markets.

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:06.609
But not only that,

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.609
you also build a simple market simulator that matches and executes orders,

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:14.324
and sets prices just like a real market.

00:00:14.324 --> 00:00:19.234
This will give you a better idea of all the activities that keep a market running.

00:00:19.234 --> 00:00:22.244
These activities generate a lot of data.

00:00:22.245 --> 00:00:25.289
Market data, which may hold important clues that you

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.589
can use to decide when to buy or sell stocks.

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:33.140
As you get introduced to the various dimensions of data available to us,

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.505
try to build an intuition for why they might be important,

00:00:36.505 --> 00:00:38.540
what signals they might carry.

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:41.570
Finally, you will learn to deal with data during

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.405
the closing and opening of global markets.

00:00:44.405 --> 00:00:46.149
If you pay close attention,

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:49.094
there might be some training opportunities there too.

00:00:49.094 --> 00:00:51.530
Are you ready? Let's get on with it.
