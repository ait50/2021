00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.934
Another aspect worth considering is that most major stock markets are

00:00:04.934 --> 00:00:09.689
actual physical buildings located in a city somewhere on the planet,

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:13.708
and because different cities around the globe are at different time zones,

00:00:13.708 --> 00:00:17.019
the actual opening and closing times also vary.

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:18.579
On any given date,

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:22.574
the Hong Kong Stock Exchange opens at 09:30 AM local time.

00:00:22.574 --> 00:00:28.449
Seven hours later, the London Stock Exchange opens at 09:30 AM their local time.

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.054
And the New York Stock Exchange opens five hours after that.

00:00:32.054 --> 00:00:37.033
This produces some additional complications and opportunities for traders.

00:00:37.033 --> 00:00:41.850
For example, consider the stocks that are listed on multiple global exchanges.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.730
The price behavior of stock on

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:48.549
the Hong Kong exchange is likely to have an effect on how it performs in London.

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:50.949
With a full seven hours between them,

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:56.255
you have plenty of time to decide how you want to trade that day on the London Exchange.

00:00:56.255 --> 00:00:59.400
Imagine the kinds of strategies you can devise.

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.085
If HSBC rises in Hong Kong,

00:01:02.085 --> 00:01:05.879
you can buy HSBC in London the moment the market opens,

00:01:05.879 --> 00:01:08.435
knowing that it is likely to rise there too.

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:12.784
Of course, you have to be careful about how you execute such strategies.

00:01:12.784 --> 00:01:17.344
Remember that if you are trying to take advantage of markets in different time zones,

00:01:17.344 --> 00:01:20.530
chances are high that other traders are too.
