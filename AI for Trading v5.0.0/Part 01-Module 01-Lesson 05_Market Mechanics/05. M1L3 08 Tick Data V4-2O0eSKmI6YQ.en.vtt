00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.540
Stock exchanges publish a stream of data that includes each individual trade.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.849
This is known as tick data.

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:12.839
Ticks are an intuitive way to gauge the health of a stock or even an entire market.

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:14.129
Are investors happy?

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.235
Are they making money?

00:00:15.234 --> 00:00:18.355
Are prices generally rising or falling, ect.?

00:00:18.355 --> 00:00:21.949
For example, you can compare each stock's latest tick price

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.589
with its previous price to see if it is going up or down.

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:28.910
You can then aggregate this information by comparing

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.090
the number of stocks on an up-tick with the number of stocks on a down-tick.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.490
These ticks also form the basis for all market data that is available for analysis.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.035
Tick data can provide further insight into how

00:00:42.034 --> 00:00:47.424
a particular stock is behaving and can help you take better intraday decisions,

00:00:47.424 --> 00:00:50.820
but you're talking about a massive volume of data.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.984
Have you ever wondered how busy stock markets are?

00:00:53.984 --> 00:00:58.695
The New York Stock Exchange carries out billions of trades every day.

00:00:58.695 --> 00:01:00.695
That's billions with a B.

00:01:00.695 --> 00:01:02.375
If you want to keep track of

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:06.805
all these transactions and use all that data to make trading decisions,

00:01:06.805 --> 00:01:08.495
that might slow you down.

00:01:08.495 --> 00:01:11.510
Even if you want to use historical tick data to build

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.704
statistical models or train a learning algorithm,

00:01:14.704 --> 00:01:17.325
it might be too much data to process.

00:01:17.325 --> 00:01:24.950
Consider that over $42 trillion worth of stocks and shares were traded in the US in 2016.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.325
A single year.

00:01:26.325 --> 00:01:29.954
That's more than double the GDP of the entire country.

00:01:29.954 --> 00:01:35.209
Fortunately, market data can be summarized in a way that drastically reduces

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:37.969
the volume of information to be processed and

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:41.530
yet retains most of the important characteristics.
