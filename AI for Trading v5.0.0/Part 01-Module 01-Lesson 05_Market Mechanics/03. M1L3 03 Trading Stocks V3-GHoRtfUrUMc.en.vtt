00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.229
Stock markets function in a very similar way.

00:00:03.229 --> 00:00:07.019
When a company first begins trading publicly it typically picks

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:11.515
a value for its stock based on certain company metrics like revenue,

00:00:11.515 --> 00:00:13.700
profits, assets et cetera.

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:15.660
But from that point on,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.015
it's stock prices almost entirely driven by how much demand exists for its stock.

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:23.359
But how do you quantify demand?

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:28.359
Think about it. Demand is nothing but how many people want to own some stock,

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.109
or how much money they're willing to pay for it.

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.289
In market speak you want to see

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:37.384
how many orders people are placing for it and at what price.

00:00:37.384 --> 00:00:42.724
Modern markets keep an electronic record of all orders that have been submitted.

00:00:42.725 --> 00:00:45.439
People who want to buy a stock can specify how

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:48.939
much or the limit that they're willing to pay for it.

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:52.299
People who want to sell can specify the least amount.

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:55.479
Again the limit they're willing to sell it for.

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:59.199
Whenever a suitable match is found between a buyer and seller,

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.130
a trade is executed.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.655
It's important to understand how orders are matched.

00:01:04.655 --> 00:01:11.299
Let say I submit a limit buy order for two shares of Netflix at $180 each.

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.575
Think of this as an offer or commitment to buy.

00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:20.430
It is also known as placing a bid where $180 is my bid price.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.840
This order gets added to the market's queue where

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.055
all the different buyer orders for Netflix are listed sorted by price.

00:01:28.055 --> 00:01:35.170
Someone else submits a limit sell order for four shares at $179.90.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.480
This is a commitment to sell.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.295
$179.90 is their asking price.

00:01:41.295 --> 00:01:44.719
Since that is less than the top most buy order,

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:48.995
the one with the highest bid price a transaction cannot take place.

00:01:48.995 --> 00:01:52.250
If there are enough stocks to fulfill that order then

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.079
the next bid could also be fulfilled with that same seller.

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:58.774
In this case the top to buy orders are

00:01:58.775 --> 00:02:03.525
executed and three out of the four shares offered by the seller are sold.

00:02:03.525 --> 00:02:08.060
The remaining one share can be used to partially fulfilled my buy order,

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.324
and the rest of it can be satisfied by the next seller who offers a suitable price.

00:02:13.324 --> 00:02:18.539
Say someone else offers to sell three shares at $179.80.

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:23.019
This order rises to the top of the sell queue due to its low price.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.780
Since this is less than my bid price my remaining one share can come from the seller.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.340
So, in the end,

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:38.615
with my limit order of my two Netflix shares at $180 I got one share at $179.90,

00:02:38.615 --> 00:02:46.865
and one at $179.80 for an average price of $179.85 per share.

00:02:46.865 --> 00:02:50.150
This sounds a lot like an auction doesn't it?

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.069
In fact, multiple auctions going on simultaneously orchestrated by

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.099
some authority that ensures every buyer and

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.254
seller gets the best available price for the stock they want to trade.

00:03:02.254 --> 00:03:05.074
This authority is the stock exchange.

00:03:05.074 --> 00:03:09.409
One problem with this model is that trading can take a lot of effort if

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:14.490
everyone has to participate in an auction each time they want to buy or sell a stock.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.175
What if you wanted to purchase some right away,

00:03:17.175 --> 00:03:19.925
how do you make sure you're getting the best price?

00:03:19.925 --> 00:03:24.490
Well, if you're at a farmers' market you might go around asking every vendor,

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.219
but that's very inefficient.

00:03:26.218 --> 00:03:29.629
Fortunately, since stock market transactions are carried

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:33.490
out electronically we have better ways of dealing with this.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.920
The stock exchange keeps track of the last price at which a stock was traded.

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:42.604
This is publicly posted as the current price of the stock,

00:03:42.604 --> 00:03:45.199
and if you wish to buy or sell shares around

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:48.369
that price you should be able to do that immediately.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.365
This is known as placing a market order.

00:03:51.365 --> 00:03:54.045
But it does introduce one complication,

00:03:54.044 --> 00:03:59.829
someone has to be willing to sell or buy that stock on the other end at all times.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.715
That's where a market maker comes into the picture.

00:04:02.715 --> 00:04:05.259
A market maker is a financial firm.

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:08.419
Usually a brokerage that continuously offers to

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:11.854
buy and sell stocks at publicly advertised prices.

00:04:11.854 --> 00:04:17.029
For example, the New York Stock Exchange has designated market makers such as

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:20.434
Citadel securities and J Stryker and Cole who are

00:04:20.435 --> 00:04:24.280
obligated to make large volumes of shares available for trading.

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:27.144
You might think why would someone want to do that?

00:04:27.144 --> 00:04:29.810
What if a market maker buys a bunch of shares

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.759
and then the price starts falling. That's right.

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:36.134
They do take a risk by continuously buying and selling.

00:04:36.134 --> 00:04:39.185
But they are usually compensated for that risk by

00:04:39.185 --> 00:04:42.780
commissions and fees that they earn on those traits.

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:48.139
They also maintain a small difference between the bid and ask prices for each stock.

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.610
Say you want to sell some Microsoft shares at market price,

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:58.230
a market maker is bidding $74 per stock which happens to be the best bid price available.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.845
So the market executes your order with that market maker.

00:05:01.845 --> 00:05:07.720
Later, another investor comes in and wants to buy some Microsoft shares at market price.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:14.230
The same market maker maybe asking for a slightly higher price to sell say $74.10.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:19.015
Assuming that's the best price available they just made $0.10 on each share,

00:05:19.014 --> 00:05:20.604
that might not seem much.

00:05:20.605 --> 00:05:22.280
But over the course of a day,

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:26.439
a market maker typically trades thousands or millions of shares.

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:28.375
That easily adds up.

00:05:28.375 --> 00:05:33.165
The difference between these prices is known as the Bid-Ask Spread.

00:05:33.165 --> 00:05:35.840
This is a very important concept to understand in

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:39.729
trading and comes into play in other situations as well.
