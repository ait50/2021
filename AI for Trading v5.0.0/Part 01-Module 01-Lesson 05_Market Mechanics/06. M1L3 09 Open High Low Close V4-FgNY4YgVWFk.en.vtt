00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.695
Investors like to focus on pieces of data that are most important.

00:00:04.695 --> 00:00:07.395
One way to do that, is to take the tick data

00:00:07.394 --> 00:00:10.334
and bucket it into regular intervals of time.

00:00:10.335 --> 00:00:13.645
It could be minutes, hours, days, months, extra.

00:00:13.644 --> 00:00:16.484
Then summarize all the trades that happened during

00:00:16.484 --> 00:00:19.945
each interval using measures that are relevant to you.

00:00:19.945 --> 00:00:23.250
Let's take a closer look at one of these intervals.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.885
Let's say it's a minute.

00:00:24.885 --> 00:00:31.535
The most common set of measures used in practice are Open High Low Close or OHLC.

00:00:31.535 --> 00:00:34.965
Open is the stock price at the beginning of the period,

00:00:34.965 --> 00:00:37.790
high and low capture its range of movement,

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:40.149
and close is where it ends.

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:44.449
These measures are often visualized using OHLC bars,

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.895
which show these four measures for each time interval in a compact form.

00:00:48.895 --> 00:00:51.800
This gives you a high level summary that might better

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:55.500
represent price movements than looking at lower prices.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.405
Here's an OHLC chart,

00:00:57.405 --> 00:01:01.445
that shows a month of price data bucketed into single days.

00:01:01.445 --> 00:01:06.709
You can spot days where the intraday prices jumped beyond opening and closing prices,

00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:08.854
indicating a lot of volatility.

00:01:08.855 --> 00:01:13.069
If you try to plot all the individual takes over this period,

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:15.835
it would be hard to identify these patterns.

00:01:15.834 --> 00:01:19.744
Sometimes these measures are used for a very specific purposes.

00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:23.579
The daily closing price is the one that is coded most often.

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:28.954
It is used by casual traders and investors who are interested in long-term gains.

00:01:28.954 --> 00:01:31.844
It is also used for accounting purposes.

00:01:31.844 --> 00:01:36.625
The opening price, is where you would expect the first trade of the day to take place.

00:01:36.625 --> 00:01:39.795
There might be a gap from last day's closing price,

00:01:39.795 --> 00:01:43.653
because of pre-market trading or trading in other markets.

00:01:43.653 --> 00:01:47.090
Some trading strategies try to utilize this difference.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.370
High-low, the high and low prices capture the movement of the stock.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.060
These peaks are easier to remember for humans compared to

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.070
individual trades or the distribution of prices during that period.
