00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.750
Stock markets typically remain open for a finite number of hours every day,

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.970
say 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM.

00:00:06.969 --> 00:00:10.300
This is when the majority of the transactions take place.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.750
Why you ask?

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.039
Well, traders and exchange operators are humans just like you and me.

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.029
They need to go back to their families,

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.945
sleep, and live a life.

00:00:19.945 --> 00:00:22.245
Okay, there is another reason.

00:00:22.245 --> 00:00:25.339
With the growing popularity of algorithmic trading,

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:30.280
a large portion of transactions today are being carried out by automated systems.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.910
They can be much more responsive to market conditions than humans,

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:36.379
and result in a sharp increase or decrease in

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.525
stock prices over a very short period of time.

00:00:39.524 --> 00:00:44.265
If left unchecked, this can result in things spiraling out of control.

00:00:44.265 --> 00:00:48.679
Closing market operations at a regular time every day provides

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:53.109
an artificial barrier that can limit the damage such events can cause.

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:56.329
This also give stock market regulators some time to

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.960
analyze the situation and implement control measures.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.430
Now, some exchanges do allow for pre-market and post-market trading.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.444
Typically 4:00 AM to 9:30 AM for pre-market,

00:01:07.444 --> 00:01:09.939
and 4:00 PM to 8:00 PM post-market.

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:13.530
However, not many traders participate in the session.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.620
So, trading volume is typically low.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.350
Either way, the takeaway from this is that

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:21.905
stock markets close operations at a certain time every day,

00:01:21.905 --> 00:01:25.909
and they typically remain closed over weekends and holidays.

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.304
As a result, when you look at stock data,

00:01:28.305 --> 00:01:33.560
you'll notice these gaps or discontinuities during periods when the markets are closed.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.600
Depending on your analysis,

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:39.039
this may or may not have an impact on the conclusions you draw.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.880
For instance, if you treat market data as a simple sequence of observations and ignore

00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:46.819
the timestamps as if the market's just smoothly

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:50.234
continue from one end of day to the next opening bell,

00:01:50.234 --> 00:01:52.829
then these gaps are not as significant.

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.439
But, if you compute a metric that involves time like the number of transactions per hour,

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.370
then ignoring these gaps can give you inaccurate results.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.995
The discontinuities can produce spikes or unusual flats in calculated values,

00:02:07.995 --> 00:02:10.605
or just outright wrong information.

00:02:10.604 --> 00:02:14.530
So, you need to be careful when dealing with market data.
