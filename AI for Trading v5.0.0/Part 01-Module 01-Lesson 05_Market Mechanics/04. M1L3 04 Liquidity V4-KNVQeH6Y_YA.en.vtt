00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.459
Market makers play an important role in keeping a stock market running smoothly.

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:08.109
Imagine what would happen without market-makers?

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.064
It would be harder to buy or sell stocks at a consistent price.

00:00:12.064 --> 00:00:14.285
As people start selling a stock,

00:00:14.285 --> 00:00:17.039
its price would start falling and vice versa.

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.004
Formally, we say that a market maker provides liquidity.

00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:25.140
Liquidity is the property of a financial asset like a stock,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.355
to be bought or sold without causing sharp changes in its price.

00:00:29.355 --> 00:00:33.810
For instance, Apple stock sees a lot of day-to-day activity.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.250
So, we say that it is liquid.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.429
If you have a large number of Apple shares and you want to sell them,

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:45.350
there's a good chance you will get a consistent and predictable price for them.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.200
On the other hand, stocks that are relatively

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.515
difficult to buy or sell are said to be illiquid.

00:00:51.515 --> 00:00:53.230
Penny stocks, for example,

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:55.334
are typically very thinly traded.

00:00:55.335 --> 00:00:59.024
Consequently, buying or selling them may be difficult.

00:00:59.024 --> 00:01:02.509
Liquidity can also vary from market to market.

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:06.825
Oh yes, the same stock can be bought or sold in different markets.

00:01:06.825 --> 00:01:09.100
HSBC is one such stock.

00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:11.989
It's listed in both New York and Hong Kong.

00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:15.934
Let's look at how its price changed during a month of trading.

00:01:15.935 --> 00:01:19.640
Each market maintains its own book of orders so

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.700
the same stock can trade at different prices in different markets.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.769
The difference is usually small, as you can see,

00:01:26.769 --> 00:01:31.140
and any big changes permeate across markets pretty quickly.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.549
That being said, it's possible to profit from

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.189
market inefficiencies by simultaneously

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.539
purchasing and selling an asset in different markets,

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.405
thereby exploiting the differences in price.

00:01:43.405 --> 00:01:46.469
This idea is known as arbitrage.
