Now that you know how stock markets work,

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.970
how trades are executed and how prices are set.

00:00:05.969 --> 00:00:11.120
We'll move on and take a closer look at the data you need to pay attention to.

Market data forms the basis for quantitative analysis and trading.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.030
In addition, there are several other sources of

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.950
information that you also need to take into account,

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:22.500
such as corporate actions,

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.765
data derived from fundamental information et cetera.

00:00:25.765 --> 00:00:28.205
All of these affect stock prices.

00:00:28.204 --> 00:00:33.129
So you need to factor them in when designing your quantitative trading pipeline.
