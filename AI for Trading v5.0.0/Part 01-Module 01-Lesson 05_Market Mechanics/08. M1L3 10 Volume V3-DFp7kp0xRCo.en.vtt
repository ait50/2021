00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.345
Besides the current price of a particular stock.

00:00:03.345 --> 00:00:07.410
Another metric that traders liked to keep an eye on is the number

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.730
of shares that are being traded over a period of time known as volume.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.345
Often shown along the bottom of an OHLC chart.

00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:18.359
The sum of unit price times volume gives you

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.980
a more accurate measure of the total amount of money moving around.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.935
Volume is also important because it can affect how sharply its price might rise or fall.

00:00:28.934 --> 00:00:31.094
Let's take a look at an example.

00:00:31.094 --> 00:00:34.894
Acme Inc is trading at $100 per share.

00:00:34.895 --> 00:00:38.300
Several investors speculate that Acme is going to launch

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:43.384
a new product and expecting the new product to increase Acme's value significantly,

00:00:43.384 --> 00:00:47.849
they place large orders to buy a total of 100,000 shares.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.310
The action of buying the shares increases the apparent demand for the stock

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.050
and consequently the price jumps to $120 per share.

00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:01.129
That is, someone actually buys the shares at $120.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.500
Why does it jump? Because there are more people who

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.069
want to buy the stock than those who want to sell.

00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:10.129
So, the sellers can charge a premium and you bet they do.

00:01:10.129 --> 00:01:13.339
Let's assume that over the next few days there aren't

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.555
any announcements and no significant new activity in Acme's stock.

00:01:17.555 --> 00:01:20.105
Some shareholders want to pull out their money

00:01:20.105 --> 00:01:22.990
and invest in another opportunity they hear about.

00:01:22.989 --> 00:01:25.694
So the price begins to fall gradually.

00:01:25.694 --> 00:01:31.039
Noticing this trend other investors decide to sell the majority of shares they bought.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.240
So that they can make a profit while the price is still high.

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:37.489
As expected, this results in a sharp drop in

00:01:37.489 --> 00:01:41.194
Acme's stock price it comes down to $90 per share.

00:01:41.194 --> 00:01:44.934
If you're monitoring the price and volume of Acme's stock,

00:01:44.935 --> 00:01:50.064
you might have noticed the relationship between volume of transactions and price changes.

00:01:50.064 --> 00:01:54.530
In general, large volumes of buy orders tend to sharply increase

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.000
the stock price and large volumes of sell orders make it fall.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.915
This is another signal that you can use to decide when to trade a given stock.

00:02:03.915 --> 00:02:06.320
It is also something to keep in mind if you're

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:09.604
a major investor and you trade in large volumes.

00:02:09.604 --> 00:02:14.239
Some hedge funds for instance will spread their transactions over multiple days,

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.280
so that their own actions don't end up affecting the price adversely.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.060
Note that the volume of transactions also varies throughout any trading day.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.050
This is something to be aware of if you want to use volume as a trading signal.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.350
Stocks that are of active interest will

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.174
typically see a lot of training at the beginning of the day.

00:02:33.175 --> 00:02:35.630
Since that is when traders get to act on,

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:40.555
all the new information gathered and analyzed since the previous day's market close.

00:02:40.555 --> 00:02:44.000
This initial activity known as price discovery,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.504
helps buyers and sellers converge on a mutually acceptable market price for each stock.

00:02:49.504 --> 00:02:54.715
Then the volume falls to a lower level as typical daily trading activity resumes.

00:02:54.715 --> 00:02:57.700
Finally, towards the end of the trading day,

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:01.579
activity tends to increase a little resulting in a higher volume.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.140
This can be due to several reasons including day traders who want to close out

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:11.284
any open positions and funds that typically update their holdings at the end of the day.

00:03:11.284 --> 00:03:15.620
In fact, some traders who have decided to buy-sell particular stocks,

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.094
may not want to risk waiting for the next day.

00:03:18.094 --> 00:03:23.020
Who knows what events might take place in the meantime and how they might affect prices.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.335
Volume carries a lot of information about a stock and is an often overlooked metric.

00:03:28.335 --> 00:03:33.770
High volume trade, is more likely to affect the price of a stock than a low volume trade.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:39.130
Therefore, volume is an important factor to consider within your trading strategy.
