Hey Miriam, what you doing?

00:00:04.844 --> 00:00:06.359
Learning.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.910
Really? Because it looks like you're taking a nap at work.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.300
That may be true but did you know that sleeping is a super important part of learning?

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.875
Huh. I didn't know that.

00:00:15.875 --> 00:00:17.504
It's a little counter-intuitive,

00:00:17.504 --> 00:00:19.949
but there are a bunch of different ways that

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.814
brain breaks are really helpful in helping you learn.

00:00:22.815 --> 00:00:24.770
If you're stuck or you're refreshing about something.

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.929
When you're learning, it can help your motivation to give yourself some breathing room,

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:29.519
take a break, think about something else and

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.484
then get back to the problem a little bit later.

00:00:31.484 --> 00:00:34.969
That makes sense. I do that to help myself relax a little bit,

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.280
let my frustration fade away then more resilient when I jump back into learning.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.259
See.

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:42.000
A nap seems like a helpful way to do that.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.494
Yeah, totally. There's also research that shows that

00:00:44.494 --> 00:00:47.809
spacing out your learning over time leads to better long-term retention.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.670
So, if you learn something and then give

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.100
your brain a little bit of time to forget it slightly,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.469
and then you come back and use that new learning again,

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.094
the neural connections in your brain, for that knowledge,

00:00:57.094 --> 00:00:58.879
are strengthened through that little bit of

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.429
difficulty that comes with that forgetting process.

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:03.335
I guess that makes sense,

00:01:03.335 --> 00:01:04.980
but what about sleep itself,

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.625
is it useful for other reasons?

00:01:06.625 --> 00:01:07.829
I mean, definitely.

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:11.299
So, when you're asleep especially in really really deep states of sleep,

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.819
your brain reactivates all the different neural networks that

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:16.639
were alive and processing while you are awake and

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.489
it sort of sorts through all the information and picks out

00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:22.399
the most important parts and it helps those connections get stronger.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.280
So, these are this really really strong conceptual understanding

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.335
of the things that you learned while you were awake.

00:01:27.334 --> 00:01:28.879
So, if I'm trying to learn something new,

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:31.640
I should make sure to get as much good quality sleep as

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.564
I can and take little breaks in my learning when I need to.

00:01:34.564 --> 00:01:37.625
That is exactly right. Taking care of your whole self including

00:01:37.625 --> 00:01:39.049
your body and your brain is

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.534
a super important part of making your learning stick long-term.

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:44.950
Thanks Marion. Would you mind telling my manager that

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.424
I'll be on the couch taking a nap? See you when I wake up.

00:01:48.424 --> 00:01:50.129
Great plan.
