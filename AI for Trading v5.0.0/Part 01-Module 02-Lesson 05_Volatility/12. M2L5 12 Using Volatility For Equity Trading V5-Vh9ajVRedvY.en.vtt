00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.464
Volatility is a very general metric of variability in returns,

00:00:04.464 --> 00:00:06.490
so it's used in many ways.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.089
In this video, we're going to mention a few possible ways that might be used in trading,

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:13.469
but there are many more possibilities.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:18.929
First, you can classify stocks as highly volatile or less volatile.

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:22.719
Some strategies might work best on low volatility stocks,

00:00:22.719 --> 00:00:26.654
so you could use the volatility metric to limit your universe.

00:00:26.655 --> 00:00:31.640
For example, one type of strategy called a mean reverting strategy is to take

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.619
a short position on an asset when it

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:37.119
appreciates because you think it will depreciate again.

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:39.939
If a stock has low volatility,

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:43.774
you may think there is less uncertainty in its fair value.

00:00:43.774 --> 00:00:47.149
So, after a large deviation from its fair value,

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.560
its price is more likely to revert.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.539
Another interesting observation about low volatility stocks is

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.899
that they actually seem to perform well compared to high volatility stocks.

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.954
In finance in general,

00:00:59.954 --> 00:01:03.234
greater risk is thought to accompany greater returns.

00:01:03.234 --> 00:01:05.480
So, the empirical observation that

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.430
low volatility stocks outperform high-volatility stocks is considered a mystery.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.425
One explanation is that people ignore really boring things in favor of exciting stocks,

00:01:16.424 --> 00:01:18.569
like the tortoise and the hare.

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:21.639
The low volatility tortoise is chugging along,

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.129
but people are buying the high-volatility hare stocks.

00:01:25.129 --> 00:01:29.239
Some exchange traded funds specifically optimized for

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:33.804
low volatility and seek to include low volatility stocks.

00:01:33.805 --> 00:01:37.880
We'll talk more about exchange traded funds in future lessons.

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:42.289
Another way to use volatility is to normalize another metric.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.345
Let me explain what I mean by that.

00:01:44.344 --> 00:01:50.189
Say you have a momentum signal consisting of returns over the previous year,

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.325
say both Netflix and Walmart have a return of 30%.

00:01:55.325 --> 00:01:58.620
This may seem to mean they're doing equally well,

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.814
but in fact, Netflix is much more volatile,

00:02:01.814 --> 00:02:04.155
it can move 30% in a week.

00:02:04.155 --> 00:02:09.020
So, you could normalize your momentum signal by dividing by the volatility.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.130
The idea is to make the comparison apples to apples.

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:16.039
This theme exists all over the place.

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:20.004
If you want to compare any signal across your entire universe,

00:02:20.004 --> 00:02:24.159
you usually get some benefit by standardizing it in this way.

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:28.750
You can also use volatility to help you determine position sizes.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.020
In general, quant traders utilize smaller position sizes in

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.055
their strategies when markets are volatile to minimize the volatility of net profits,

00:02:38.055 --> 00:02:41.430
commonly called profit and loss, or P&amp;L.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.610
Moreover, the volatility of overall portfolio, P&amp;L,

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.950
is often used as a gauge of the professional ability of

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:52.639
portfolio managers managing multiple trading strategies.

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.629
So, the ability to allocate capital,

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.979
taking volatility into account becomes very important.

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:03.919
If you believe you can forecast volatility with a certain level of confidence,

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:08.724
you can adjust your portfolio sizing in anticipation of a pending storm in the market.

00:03:08.724 --> 00:03:11.799
But how would you decide how much money to move?

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.630
Well, you can include volatility in

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:18.060
a formula used to determine the size of your positions.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.854
Every trader might do this slightly differently,

00:03:20.854 --> 00:03:22.003
but as an example,

00:03:22.003 --> 00:03:24.639
a trader might use a formula like this.

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:31.219
R divided by sigma times M times last close equals position size,

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:35.359
where r is the dollar amount the trader is willing to lose if

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.100
an M sigma event occurs against her or his position.

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:45.719
Sigma is the annualized volatility of the security or strategy in question,

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:48.865
M is a trader to find integer,

00:03:48.865 --> 00:03:51.860
last close is the last closing price of

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.630
the security or the equivalent for a portfolio of stocks,

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:59.594
and position size is the number of stocks to trade.

00:03:59.594 --> 00:04:05.094
This will lead to smaller position sizes for more expensive and more volatile assets.

00:04:05.094 --> 00:04:08.719
If you determine your position using a formula like this,

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:11.050
then when you notice market conditions changing,

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.469
you might decide to recalculate and adjust your position sizes accordingly.

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:19.129
Sometimes trading strategies define thresholds at which to

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:23.949
automatically sell a stock to take a guaranteed profit or limit losses.

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:27.740
An upper threshold is called the take profit level,

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.540
while a lower threshold is called a stop-loss level.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:36.345
These might be defined as a target price or as a percent change from an entry price.

00:04:36.345 --> 00:04:39.835
However, if market volatility increases,

00:04:39.834 --> 00:04:45.753
many stocks might reach these levels more frequently causing more frequent trades.

00:04:45.754 --> 00:04:50.600
During volatile times, traders might adjust these thresholds accordingly.
