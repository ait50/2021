00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.430
At this point, you may be wondering,

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.425
well, what causes volatility anyway?

00:00:05.424 --> 00:00:08.820
A natural assumption may be that volatility of

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.390
a stock is caused by new information reaching the market.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.664
New information causes people to revise their opinions about the value of a stock.

00:00:17.664 --> 00:00:21.294
The price of the stock changes which causes volatility.

00:00:21.294 --> 00:00:25.425
However, research hasn't supported this conclusion.

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:29.820
Research studies have compared the variance of stock price returns between

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.259
the closing price on one day and the closing price on the next trading day,

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:37.655
when there are no non-trading days in between,

00:00:37.655 --> 00:00:41.855
and the closing price on a Friday and the closing price on a Monday.

00:00:41.854 --> 00:00:44.779
You might expect the weekend variance to be

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.280
three times the midweek variance because the real elapsed time is three times as long.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.850
However, this has not been found to be the case,

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.109
even for assets affected by news that is equally

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.710
likely to arrive midweek or on a weekend.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.510
The weekend variants of orange juice futures prices which are mainly affected by

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.585
weather news is only about 1.5 times the midweek variance.

00:01:10.584 --> 00:01:14.284
The implication of all this is that volatility is,

00:01:14.284 --> 00:01:15.519
to a large extent,

00:01:15.519 --> 00:01:17.594
caused by trading itself.

00:01:17.594 --> 00:01:20.329
This idea is consistent with the observation

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:23.614
that volatility and volume are frequently correlated.

00:01:23.614 --> 00:01:26.119
All other things being equal,

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.120
greater trading volume means greater volatility.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.270
But during a time when volatility is high because

00:01:32.269 --> 00:01:35.899
lots of trading is happening and the price goes up,

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.290
you might reasonably expect the price to go back down.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:40.825
If there was no news,

00:01:40.825 --> 00:01:45.129
the price probably didn't increase because the company's performance improved.

00:01:45.129 --> 00:01:49.759
It probably increased because people wanted to trade large numbers of

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.055
stocks and sellers charged a premium for that ability to trade, or liquidity.

00:01:55.055 --> 00:01:59.450
This means that for equity strategies in high volatility times,

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.490
a type of strategy considered more likely to do well is a type of strategy based on

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:09.854
the idea that prices will return to their running mean when they go way up or down.

00:02:09.854 --> 00:02:13.044
These are called mean reversion strategies.

00:02:13.044 --> 00:02:15.125
In low volatility times,

00:02:15.125 --> 00:02:17.479
momentum strategies may work better.

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:22.414
There are other general patterns in market behavior with respect to volatility.

00:02:22.414 --> 00:02:25.789
One is that market volatility tends to be high when

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:29.754
the market is going down and low when the market is going up.

00:02:29.754 --> 00:02:36.019
Because of this, volatility is often quoted in the popular media as the gauge for fear.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.939
To see this most clearly,

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:42.349
let's look at an index that essentially measures market volatility.

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.199
You might have heard of the VIX Index,

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:51.530
which is a market index measuring the volatility of 30-day S&amp;P 500 Index options.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.884
The value of the VIX index represents the annualized volatility of the S&amp;P 500 Index.

00:02:57.884 --> 00:03:01.969
This plot of the VIX Index and S&amp;P 500 Index over

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:06.465
the same periods shows that the VIX spikes when the S&amp;P dips.

00:03:06.465 --> 00:03:10.115
For example, between 1990 and 2015,

00:03:10.115 --> 00:03:15.480
VIX spiked to a record 80 during October and November of 2008 when,

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:19.129
as you remember, the markets were roiling from a huge crisis.

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:20.549
I know what you're thinking,

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.925
can you trade the VIX itself?

00:03:22.925 --> 00:03:26.885
You guessed it. Humans will turn anything into tradeable securities.

00:03:26.884 --> 00:03:30.949
You can trade futures and options on the VIX Index which

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:35.539
essentially amounts to making a bet on the volatility of the S&amp;P 500.

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:39.824
The VIX is published by the Chicago Board Options Exchange,

00:03:39.824 --> 00:03:43.729
which publishes a range of other volatility indices on stock

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:48.215
and commodity indices currencies and some individual stocks.

00:03:48.215 --> 00:03:53.930
There's even a Volatility Index of the VIX Index, the VVIX.
