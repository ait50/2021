00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
It would be great to know what will happen before it happens, wouldn't it?

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.085
Traders sometimes try to forecast volatility in order to anticipate the market.

00:00:09.085 --> 00:00:14.070
The general thinking is that it's easier to predict volatility than price,

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.974
volatility tends to be sticky.

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:20.574
A volatile market trading day is often followed by another volatile one.

00:00:20.574 --> 00:00:23.114
When you're trying to model volatility,

00:00:23.114 --> 00:00:27.959
you can use a special form of the autoregressive model called ARCH,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.950
which stands for, autoregressive conditionally heteroscedastic.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.960
Okay, now those are some really big words,

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.789
so let's break it down.

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:40.280
Autoregressive simply means that

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.469
the current value is somehow related to the recent past values.

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:48.064
Heteroscedastic means that the variable we're trying to

00:00:48.064 --> 00:00:52.864
model may have different magnitudes of variability at different time points.

00:00:52.865 --> 00:00:57.204
The magnitude of variability is commonly measured using variance.

00:00:57.204 --> 00:01:02.695
Finally, conditional here, refers to a constraint we place in this model,

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:05.870
which limits the heteroscedastic property to be

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.715
conditionally dependent on the previous value or values of the variable.

00:01:10.715 --> 00:01:13.850
An arch model looks really similar to the formula

00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:17.084
we had for an exponentially weighted moving average.

00:01:17.084 --> 00:01:22.574
The current variance is a weighted sum of past squared log returns,

00:01:22.575 --> 00:01:26.390
but now we think of the weights as being parameters of a model.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.674
For example, in an arch one model,

00:01:29.674 --> 00:01:34.314
if rt represents the log return of a stock at time t,

00:01:34.314 --> 00:01:38.060
then we say that its variance is equal to alpha zero,

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.079
plus alpha one, times r t minus one squared.

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.564
Alpha zero and alpha one are the two parameters of the model.

00:01:46.564 --> 00:01:51.355
You can think about alpha zero as representing a baseline variance,

00:01:51.355 --> 00:01:54.350
and alpha one as waiting the contribution to

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:57.744
the model of the log return at the previous time point.

00:01:57.745 --> 00:02:00.859
This can be extended to an arch m model,

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:05.590
where the variance is conditionally dependent on m past timesteps.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.895
Note that here, the variance is being modeled only based on the squared log returns.

00:02:11.895 --> 00:02:14.210
We can also add terms to make

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.659
the current variance dependent on previous estimates of the variance.

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:22.685
To address this, you could modify the expression to include

00:02:22.685 --> 00:02:27.015
terms with previous variance values denoted as sigma squared.

00:02:27.014 --> 00:02:28.875
This is known as the GARCH,

00:02:28.875 --> 00:02:31.284
or generalized arch model.

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:35.199
And you can parameterize it as GARCH m, n,

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:38.389
where m is the number of log return terms,

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:42.484
and n is the number of variants terms to include in the model.

00:02:42.485 --> 00:02:45.410
Once you're satisfied with a model you've built,

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:48.990
it's time to think about how you might use it to make trading decisions.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.340
You may choose to generate buy,

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.680
sell signals directly based on your predictions,

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.245
or you may use it in an indirect way.

00:02:57.245 --> 00:03:03.164
You can analyze past signal returns and see if it has somehow correlated with volatility.

00:03:03.164 --> 00:03:08.814
For example, it's well known that certain strategies do better with higher volatility,

00:03:08.814 --> 00:03:14.120
and then you can choose to activate that strategy only during high volatility periods.
