00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.639
Say we want to get a sense of how our returns are going to vary in the future.

00:00:04.639 --> 00:00:09.519
That is to say, we want to estimate the volatility of a stock we've invested in.

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:13.695
How do we do it? Well, the simplest way is to calculate

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:18.585
the standard deviation of the log returns of some price data that we have for this stock,

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:20.685
eg data from the past.

00:00:20.684 --> 00:00:23.469
This is called historical volatility.

00:00:23.469 --> 00:00:27.179
The first step is to calculate log returns from prices.

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:30.140
The first log return datum will be undefined

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.765
since there is no price datum from the time point proceeding it.

00:00:33.765 --> 00:00:36.679
So, if you start with n plus one price data,

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:39.130
you will now have n log returns.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.580
Then, the formula for volatility is the formula for standard deviation,

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.030
where the observations are log returns.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.219
One thing to keep in mind is that,

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:51.384
since volatility is defined as the standard deviation,

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:55.744
it treats log returns that are above and below the mean the same way.

00:00:55.744 --> 00:00:59.494
This is because in the calculation of standard deviation,

00:00:59.494 --> 00:01:02.765
price differences relative to the mean are squared,

00:01:02.765 --> 00:01:07.064
so that negative and positive differences are combined into one quantity.

00:01:07.064 --> 00:01:10.810
So, after doing these calculations for this small dataset,

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.144
we'd get sigma equals 0.025.

00:01:14.144 --> 00:01:17.369
Since our dataset consisted of daily prices,

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.030
this is the estimate of the daily volatility.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.109
Sometimes though, instead of having a price for every day,

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:26.415
you might only have a price for every week,

00:01:26.415 --> 00:01:28.350
or a price for every month.

00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:30.184
If you take these data,

00:01:30.185 --> 00:01:31.915
calculate the log returns,

00:01:31.915 --> 00:01:34.225
and then calculate the standard deviation,

00:01:34.224 --> 00:01:37.094
you would get a different number for the volatility.

00:01:37.094 --> 00:01:39.799
For example, for stocks,

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:46.120
the standard deviation of daily log returns is typically around 0.006 to 0.03,

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:52.060
while the standard deviation of weekly log returns is typically around 0.01 to 0.07.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.894
If you think about it, this makes sense.

00:01:54.894 --> 00:01:57.890
This is just telling you that stock prices change

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.500
more over the course of a week than over the course of a day.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.840
So weekly returns vary more widely than daily returns.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:12.719
So your volatility estimate depends on the time frequency of the underlying price data.

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:15.949
But we want to be able to come up with

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:20.784
a volatility number that we can compare across different situations and datasets.

00:02:20.784 --> 00:02:22.729
In order to do this,

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:25.189
people typically calculate a value that

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:29.159
corresponds to the standard deviation of annual log returns.

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.699
If you don't have several years of data,

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:35.514
and you can't calculate the standard deviation of annual log returns,

00:02:35.514 --> 00:02:39.049
you can calculate the standard deviation of log returns of

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.910
another frequency and extrapolate it to an annual one.

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:46.189
This is called calculating the annualized volatility.

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:48.930
And we're going to talk about it in the next lesson.
