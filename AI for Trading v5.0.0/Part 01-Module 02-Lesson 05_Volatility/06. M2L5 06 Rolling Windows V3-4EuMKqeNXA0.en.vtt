00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.879
So, we know how to calculate volatility for a given period.

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:08.714
This gives us one number to capture return variability for this period,

00:00:08.714 --> 00:00:12.189
but we also know that the market changes over time.

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:14.594
We know the market goes up and down,

00:00:14.595 --> 00:00:17.569
and while sometimes it seems highly variable,

00:00:17.568 --> 00:00:20.210
other times it seems relatively placid.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.230
For example, during the last financial crisis in 2008,

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.669
stock prices were extremely volatile.

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:32.130
Whereas 2016 and 2017 have marked a relatively low volatility period.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.844
So, what do you do if you want to understand how volatility is changing over time?

00:00:37.844 --> 00:00:41.079
One option is to use a rolling window.

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:44.179
So, if you wanted to estimate today's volatility,

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:47.119
you would calculate the standard deviation of a set of

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:50.894
log returns from sometime in the past up to yesterday.

00:00:50.895 --> 00:00:54.170
This is a practical method that is commonly implemented,

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.060
but how long should the time window be?

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.560
When you take a look at the volatility of previous days to estimate today's volatility,

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.859
how important is the volatility from one day ago?

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:07.650
How about from one week ago?

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.305
Or how about from one month ago?

00:01:10.305 --> 00:01:13.250
A long window will mean that the value you

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.599
compute may not react to changes in market conditions quickly enough.

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:21.769
To short window may mean that the computed value becomes

00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:26.209
two variable over different window periods to be used reliably.

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:30.389
Your choice of time window is going to depend on your application.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.069
In general, if your signal or strategy involves holding onto purchases for long periods,

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:39.439
you can afford to use a longer time window for

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.450
computation and vice versa for short holding periods.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.670
You can also use windows of different sizes to gain insight into how volatility evolves.
