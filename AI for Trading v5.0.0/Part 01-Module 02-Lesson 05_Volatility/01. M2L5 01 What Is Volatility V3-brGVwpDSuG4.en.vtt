00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.355
Welcome back. In this lesson,

00:00:02.355 --> 00:00:04.240
we're going to tell you all about volatility.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.015
Volatility is an important measure of risk, but what is risk?

00:00:08.015 --> 00:00:10.260
We've talked a little about it already,

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:12.969
and you may have an intuitive idea for what it means.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.650
It's basically uncertainty about the future and in particular,

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:18.824
uncertainty about bad things happening,

00:00:18.824 --> 00:00:21.619
like losing all the money you've invested in something.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.240
In finance, risks can be thought of as uncertainty about future returns.

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:30.074
Uncertainty, that sounds kind of hard to measure.

00:00:30.074 --> 00:00:32.225
How do you measure what you don't know?

00:00:32.225 --> 00:00:36.079
Well, we can get started by thinking of the log return as

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.640
a random variable that can assume different values with different probabilities.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.829
An important way of characterizing

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.250
a probability distribution is with it's expected or mean value.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.664
The mean is the average of many measurements of the random variable,

00:00:51.664 --> 00:00:53.420
and you already know that

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.315
the standard deviation is a measure of the spread of a distribution.

00:00:57.314 --> 00:01:00.379
Volatility is simply the standard deviation of

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.465
the probability distribution of log returns.

00:01:03.465 --> 00:01:07.250
It's a measure of the spread of this particular distribution.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.625
It measures the dispersion of log returns around the expected log return.

00:01:11.625 --> 00:01:16.694
Volatility gives you a sense of the range of values log returns are likely to fall into.

00:01:16.694 --> 00:01:19.729
For example, say you measured log returns on

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.730
investment for several years and found that they happen

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:29.460
to be distributed more or less normally with a mean or expected log return of about 5%,

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:32.689
and an annual volatility of about 6%.

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:35.855
If you remember, that for a normal distribution,

00:01:35.855 --> 00:01:39.620
about 95% of observations fall in a range from

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.590
negative two to positive two standard deviations around the mean.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.049
This would mean that 95% of the annual returns would

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.534
be between approximately negative 7% and positive 17%.

00:01:52.534 --> 00:01:55.604
So, why spend all this time learning about volatility?

00:01:55.605 --> 00:01:58.430
Basically, every investor trying to

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.460
understand what level of return they can expect to get on

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:04.429
average will also care about how often and by

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.790
how much their returns are going to differ from that average.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.610
In essence, volatility is a simple metric that characterizes variability in returns,

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.690
that has many different users all over the financial world.

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:20.270
Let's list a few examples of the ways you might see it used.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.145
As I said, volatility is one way to measure risk.

00:02:24.145 --> 00:02:26.240
Traders can use volatility of

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.150
a trading instrument to define position sizing in a portfolio.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.340
Volatility can be used in the design of alphas, that is,

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.390
as part of the logic that defines which stocks to trade and when to trade them.

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:44.054
Volatility is very important for determining the prices of options contracts.

00:02:44.055 --> 00:02:47.835
Finally, it's possible to trade volatility directly.

00:02:47.835 --> 00:02:53.140
For example, you can trade an instrument that tracks the volatility of the S&amp;P 500,

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:56.069
we'll learn a little more about this later on.
