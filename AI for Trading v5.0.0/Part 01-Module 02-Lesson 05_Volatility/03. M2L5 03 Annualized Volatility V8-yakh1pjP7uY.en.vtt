00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.094
In this lesson, I'm going to tell you how to annualize volatility.

00:00:04.094 --> 00:00:07.380
Annualizing volatility means extrapolating

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.450
a standard deviation of log returns calculated at some time frequency,

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.235
to a standard deviation of log returns calculated on an annual frequency.

00:00:17.235 --> 00:00:22.080
I want to give you more intuition for what the annualized volatility represents.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.630
Usually, when you calculate volatility,

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.460
you have a small price series.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.160
You cannot calculate the standard deviation of

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.070
annual log returns because you don't have several years of data.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.750
Now, if that price series were to continue to generate prices for many years,

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:39.890
such that the mean,

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.525
and the standard deviation of the log return distribution remain the same,

00:00:44.525 --> 00:00:48.874
and you calculated the standard deviation of the annual log returns,

00:00:48.874 --> 00:00:51.950
you would get the same number as you would get by

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.950
annualizing the standard deviation of log returns of another time frequency.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.935
So the way to annualize the daily standard deviation

00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:05.270
of log returns is to multiply by the square root of 252,

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.555
the number of trading days in a year.

00:01:07.555 --> 00:01:12.515
Similarly, to annualize the monthly standard deviation of log returns,

00:01:12.515 --> 00:01:14.810
you multiply by the square root of 12,

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.820
the number of months in a year.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.370
Why the square root?Why not just the number of days?

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.575
This is what we're going to explain now.

00:01:22.575 --> 00:01:25.040
An important fact we need to remember for

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.780
this calculation is that log returns some overtime.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.709
As a quick refresher,

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:33.065
if we have price data for three times,

00:01:33.065 --> 00:01:35.540
we can see that if we add the log return

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.510
for the first period and the log return for the second period,

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.210
we get the log return for the entire time period,

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.620
the natural log of P3 divided by p1.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.100
Now, let's look at the case of annualizing monthly log returns.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.110
If r is the log return,

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.470
we know that the log return for the year is the sum of the log returns for each month.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.985
Now, let's think of each monthly log return as a random variable.

00:02:00.985 --> 00:02:06.005
This just means that it's a quantity that represents the outcome of a random phenomenon.

00:02:06.005 --> 00:02:08.720
The likelihood that it takes different values

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.885
can be represented with a probability distribution.

00:02:11.885 --> 00:02:15.665
In fact, let's make a few important assumptions.

00:02:15.665 --> 00:02:18.665
First, we'll assume that the random variables

00:02:18.665 --> 00:02:22.805
representing the log returns for each month have the same distribution.

00:02:22.805 --> 00:02:26.164
Second, we'll assume that they are independent.

00:02:26.164 --> 00:02:28.910
So the log return you end up with for one month

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.060
doesn't depend on the log return for any other month.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.065
Let's think of the annual log return as another random variable.

00:02:36.065 --> 00:02:40.750
The sum of the monthly log returns equals the annual log return.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.235
Recall what it means to sum random variables.

00:02:44.235 --> 00:02:48.080
You can generate the distribution of the sum by repeatedly taking

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.450
sets of samples from each of the constituent distributions, and summing them.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.259
We've set up the situation,

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:55.865
but let's remember our goal.

00:02:55.865 --> 00:02:59.630
We want to relate the standard deviation of the distribution of

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.765
monthly log returns to the standard deviation of the distribution of annual log returns.

00:03:04.765 --> 00:03:08.075
So now, we're going to use a key fact that is true

00:03:08.075 --> 00:03:11.390
whenever you some independent random variables.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.415
That the variance of the sum equals the sum of the variances.

00:03:15.415 --> 00:03:17.540
Getting back to the calculation,

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.435
we know the variance of the annual log return

00:03:20.435 --> 00:03:24.475
equals the variance of the sum of the monthly log returns.

00:03:24.475 --> 00:03:28.520
Since we assumed that the monthly log returns are independent,

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.385
we have that the variance of the annual log return

00:03:31.385 --> 00:03:35.050
is the sum of the variances of the monthly log returns.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.675
Variance is just the square of the standard deviation,

00:03:38.675 --> 00:03:40.790
so we can write it as Sigma squared.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.610
But we also assumed that the standard deviations of

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.810
the monthly log returns were all the same value, Sigma month.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.725
So we end up with 12 factors of Sigma month.

00:03:50.725 --> 00:03:52.595
When we take the square root,

00:03:52.595 --> 00:03:55.760
we see the relationship between the standard deviations.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.265
So you now see how you can annualize the standard deviations of the monthly log returns.

00:04:01.265 --> 00:04:03.670
You multiply it by the square root of 12.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.010
In a nutshell, this arises because you can

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.810
sum the variances of independent random variables.

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.725
Similarly, if you want to annualize the standard deviation of weekly log returns,

00:04:15.725 --> 00:04:17.809
you multiply by the square root of 52,

00:04:17.809 --> 00:04:19.555
the number of weeks in a year.

00:04:19.555 --> 00:04:23.555
If you want to annualize the standard deviation of daily log returns,

00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:26.330
you multiply it by the square root of 252,

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.980
the number of trading days in a year.
