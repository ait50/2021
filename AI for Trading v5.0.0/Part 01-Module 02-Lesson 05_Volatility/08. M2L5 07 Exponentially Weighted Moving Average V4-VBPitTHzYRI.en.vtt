00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.765
When we're predicting today's volatility,

00:00:02.765 --> 00:00:06.280
we may think that data from the past month are important,

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.199
but what happened yesterday is even more important than what happened last week.

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:15.779
This introduces another possibility for how to estimate volatility.

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:21.480
What we can do to increase the influence of the more recent past is weight,

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.210
log return observations from different days, differently.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.380
One common method is to weigh the observation from yesterday, the highest,

00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:33.070
the one from the day before a little less,

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.399
the day before that a little less,

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.350
and so on into the past.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.980
In fact, the weights decrease by the same percent with

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:44.750
every step which means they decrease exponentially.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.519
As a result, this is called an exponentially weighted moving average.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.500
Let's see how to calculate it.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.310
Let's start with the formula for historical volatility.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:01.304
Let's imagine we're estimating today's volatility using a window of n past days.

00:01:01.304 --> 00:01:06.853
We'll add the subscript t to indicate that we are calculating today's volatility.

00:01:06.853 --> 00:01:09.109
Let's square both sides.

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:12.950
Remember, Sigma squared is the variance but we can always take

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.290
its square root to get the standard deviation i.e. the volatility.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.359
Now, let's make some simplifications.

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:23.969
Let's assume that the mean log return is zero.

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:26.525
This is okay to do because when you have

00:01:26.525 --> 00:01:29.859
log returns calculated over a short time interval,

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:31.640
like daily log returns,

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.474
their mean is generally small compared to their standard deviation.

00:01:35.474 --> 00:01:38.700
Now, let's change n minus one to n,

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.280
this simplification won't influence the result much when n is large,

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.570
and allows us to write the estimate of the variance this way.

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:49.729
As you can see, this is just an average of

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.920
the squared log returns in which each squared log return is weighted equally.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.180
Let's change the arithmetic average to a weighted average and make

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.995
the weights decrease with each step into the past like we discussed earlier.

00:02:03.995 --> 00:02:08.069
We're going to introduce a new parameter and lets call it Lambda.

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.900
Lambda is a number between zero and one,

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.789
and it represents the factor by which the weights in

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:17.334
the weighted average decrease as we go back in time.

00:02:17.335 --> 00:02:19.080
So, let's construct the sum.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.865
The first term will be yesterday's log return squared,

00:02:22.865 --> 00:02:27.365
multiplied by Lambda to the zeroth power which equals one.

00:02:27.365 --> 00:02:32.534
The next term will be Lambda times the log return of the day before squared.

00:02:32.534 --> 00:02:36.109
And the next term will have another factor of Lambda.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.670
This keeps going until we have a term for every log return in our window.

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:43.619
Now, to make it a weighted average,

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.830
we just have to divide by the sum of the weights, and that's it.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.780
That's the formula for an exponentially weighted,

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.634
moving average estimate of the variance of the log returns.

00:02:54.634 --> 00:02:56.329
So to get the volatility,

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.330
we would just take the square root of that estimate.
