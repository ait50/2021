00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.794
Trading might use metrics availability to define trading signals.

00:00:04.794 --> 00:00:08.560
For example, you can take a fix length rolling window and

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.350
calculate the mean and standard deviation of prices within that window.

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.309
If we draw a line,

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.690
two standard deviations above and below the rolling mean,

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.020
we can get a sense of the trend and tendency to fluctuate of prices,

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.100
these lines are called Bollinger Bands.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.700
We can use Bollinger Bands to generate trading signals.

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.269
For example, we might think that if the price is below

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.130
the lower band and starts to cross back inside towards the mean,

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.594
that the price is still fairly low and on the rise,

00:00:42.594 --> 00:00:44.975
this might be a good time to buy.

00:00:44.975 --> 00:00:47.960
We might also think that if the price is above

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.049
the upper band and starts to move back towards the mean,

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:53.339
that this might be a good time to sell.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.750
This is one type of strategy you might use to take advantage of

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.310
situations when the stock price continually returns to its running mean.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.820
Alternatively, when the price hits the upper band,

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:07.729
you may think that is going to keep going that it's breaking

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.880
out to take advantage of these situations,

00:01:10.879 --> 00:01:13.694
you can define a slightly different type of strategy.

00:01:13.694 --> 00:01:18.744
If the price of a stock is not very variable but continues to increase,

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:22.850
you can get a situation where it keeps increasing but never hits

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:27.384
the upper Bollinger Band defined by the standard deviation of the prices.

00:01:27.385 --> 00:01:33.980
Instead, you can use an upper band defined by the maximum value within a rolling window.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.710
If the price continues to increase,

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:41.234
it will continue to reach new maxima and will hit that upper band.

00:01:41.234 --> 00:01:47.329
One strategy you might take defined by this signal is to enter a long position

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.179
on the stock when it hits the rolling max

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.800
and enter a short position when it hits the rolling min.
