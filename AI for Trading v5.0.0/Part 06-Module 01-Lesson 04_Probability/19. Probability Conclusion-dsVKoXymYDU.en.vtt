00:00:02.359 --> 00:00:05.939
You now have a basic understanding of probability. Great job!

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.824
Let's quickly summarize what was covered in this lesson.

00:00:09.824 --> 00:00:12.059
You learned about the probability of an event.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.245
Such as the outcome of a coin flip.

00:00:14.244 --> 00:00:15.599
You learned that the probability of

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.769
the opposite event is one minus the probability of this event.

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.890
And you learned about the probability of a composite event,

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.375
which was in the form of P times P times P and so on.

00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:29.634
This rule is true because the events we've

00:00:29.635 --> 00:00:32.325
observed so far are independent of one another,

00:00:32.325 --> 00:00:36.910
which means the outcome of one event doesn't affect the outcome of another,

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:40.649
which is also the case in the next lesson on binomial distributions.

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.189
However, if we're looking at the probability of dependent events,

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:49.170
say the probability of rain tomorrow given that it rained today, this rule doesn't hold.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.704
Dependent events where the outcomes of later events depend

00:00:52.704 --> 00:00:56.234
on what has already happened are at the heart of the following topics,

00:00:56.234 --> 00:00:58.439
unconditional probability and Bayes Rule.
