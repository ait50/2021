00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now that was a challenging question.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm going to make it even more challenging for you now.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I'll give you a loaded coin--the probability for H is 0.6.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I expect this will take you awhile on a piece of paper

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
to really calculate this probability over here.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But you can do exactly the same thing.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You go through the truth table.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
You apply the multiplication I showed you before

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
to calculate the probability of each outcome; they're not the same anymore.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
H, H, H is clearly more likely than T, T, T.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And when you've done this, add the corresponding figures up,

00:00:34.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and tell me what the answer is.
