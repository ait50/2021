00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And this answer is tricky. We will derive it through the truth table. Now there's eight possible cases.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Flip one can come of heads or tail; same for flip two, heads, tail, heads, tail;

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and the same for flip three and if you look at this every possible combination is represented.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
For example, these are heads, tail, tail.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Now each of those outcomes has the same probability of an eighth, because it's eight cases.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So 8 x 1/8 sums up to 1. In how many cases do we have exactly one H?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It turns out that it's true for only three cases.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The H could be in the first position, in the second position, or in the third position.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So three out of eight cases have a single H.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Each of those carries a probability so we sum those cases up to carry a total of 3/8 of a probability.

00:00:58.000 --> 99:59:59.000
These are the same as 0.375.
