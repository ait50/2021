00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's talk about a fair coin.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The probability of the coin coming up heads is written in this P notation.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This reads probability of the coin coming up heads.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And in a fair coin, the chances are 50%.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
That is, in half the coin flips, the coin should come up heads.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
In probability we often write 0.5,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
which is half of 1.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So a probability of 1 means it always occurs.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
A probability of 0.5 means it occurs half the time.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And let me just ask you

00:00:35.000 --> 99:59:59.000
what do you think, for this coin, is the probability of tails?
