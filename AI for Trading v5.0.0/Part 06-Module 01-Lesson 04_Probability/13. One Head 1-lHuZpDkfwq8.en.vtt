00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The truth table gets more interesting when we ask different questions.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Suppose we flip our coin twice.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
What we care about is that exactly one of the two things is heads,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and thereby exactly the other one is tails.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
For a fair coin, what do you think the probability would be

00:00:19.000 --> 99:59:59.000
that if I flip it twice we would see heads exactly once?
