00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And you can debate it, but I think the best answer is no.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This is what's called a fair coin,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and that means it really has a 50% chance of coming up tails.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So let me spin it again.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.000
[sound of coin spinning]

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And, not surprisingly, it actually came up tails this time.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So probability is a method of describing the anticipated outcome

00:00:30.000 --> 99:59:59.000
of these coin flips.
