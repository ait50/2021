00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And, yes, the answer is zero.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And we find a little law here we just want to point out,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
which is the probability of heads plus the probability of tails

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
equals 1.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And the reason why that's the case is the coin either comes up heads or tails.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
There is no other a choice.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So no matter what happens, if I look at heads and tails combined

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
the chances of either of those occurring is 1,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
because we know it's going to happen.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So we can use this law

00:00:30.000 --> 99:59:59.000
to compute the probability of tails for other examples.
