00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And the answer shall be 0.5.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And this is a nontrivial question.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let's do the truth table.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So, for flip-1, we have the outcomes of heads, heads, tails, tails.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
For flip-2, heads and tails and heads and tails.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
These are all possible outcomes.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And we know for the fair coin each outcome was equally likely.

00:00:25.000 --> 99:59:59.000
That is, exactly one quarter.
