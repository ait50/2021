00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And the answer is 1.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
To see this, we know that the probability of tails is 0.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
All the probability goes to heads.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
1  1 = 1

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
1  0 = 0

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
0  1 = 0

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And 0  0 = 0.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And it's easy to verify that all these things add up to 1.

00:00:18.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Our (H,H) is just 1.
