00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In our example, we observed heads twice.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So now I want to ask you a really tricky question:

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
What's the probability of observing heads and heads

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
if you flip the same unbiased coin twice?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This means in each flip we assume the probability of heads is 0.5.

00:00:20.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Please answer here.
