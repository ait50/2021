00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And once again, we can answer this using a truth table.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now the truth table will have 36 different entries,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
six for the first throw times six for the second throw,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and there isn't enough space on this tablet to draw all the 36 entries.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So, let me just draw the ones that really matter, one-one, two-two, and so on all the way to a six-six.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So, each one of those is a probability of 1/6 for the first outcome times 1/6 for the second,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
which gives me 1/36, and the same logic applies everywhere.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So, for all of these six outcomes, I have 1/36 of a chance this outcome would materialize.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Adding them all up gives me 1/6, why?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Because, I get 6 times 36 and I can simply this back to 1/6 that's just the same as 0.16667.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So, 1/6 times, you will get a double

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Now, when you're play a game like backgammon, which is played with two dice,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
it might not feel like this, I can swear I don't get a double of 1/6 moves,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
but it's actually true that that's the right--that's the correct probability.
