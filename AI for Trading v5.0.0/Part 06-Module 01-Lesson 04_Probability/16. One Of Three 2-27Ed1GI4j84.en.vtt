00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And my answer is 0.288. How do I get that? Let's look at the three critical cases.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:23.000
H T T is 0.6 for H times 0.4 for tails times another 0.4 for tails again and it gives me 0.096.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Now it turns out this case over here has the same probability because all we do is we order it

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:40.000
0.4 x 0.6 x 0.4 and we know that in multiplication the order doesn't matter,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:50.000
so you get the same 0.096, and by the same logic, if third one also gets me 0.096.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So adding this 0.096s together, if we get them, gives me 0.288.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So I did not have to fill the entire truth table, which you might have done in the derivation.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I only have to fill out the cases I care about, yet they give me their correct result.
