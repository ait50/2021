00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So we just learned something important.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
There's a probability for an outcome; I'm going to call it A, for now.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And we learned that the probability of the opposite outcome,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
which we're going to call Â¬A

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
(this over here just means "not")

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
is 1 minus the probability as expressed right over here.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
That's a very basic law of probability, which will become handy as we go forward,

00:00:25.000 --> 99:59:59.000
so please remember it.
