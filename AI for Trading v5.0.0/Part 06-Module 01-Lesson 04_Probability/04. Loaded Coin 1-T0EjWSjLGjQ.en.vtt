00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
A loaded coin is one that comes up with one of the two much more frequently than the other.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So, for example, suppose I have a coin that always comes up heads.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
What probability would I assess for this coin to come up heads?

00:00:15.000 --> 99:59:59.000
What would be the right number over here?
