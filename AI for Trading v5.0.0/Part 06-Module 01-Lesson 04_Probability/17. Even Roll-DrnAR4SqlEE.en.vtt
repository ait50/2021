00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So let's do one final exercise.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now I am throwing dice.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The difference between dice and coins is that there are now 6 possible outcomes.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Let me just draw them, and say it's a fair die,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
which means each of the different sides comes up with a probability over 6

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
for any of the numbers you can plug in over here.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
What do you think the probability is the die comes up with an even number?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I'm going to write this as the outcome of the die is even.

00:00:34.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And you can once again use a truth table to calculate that number.
