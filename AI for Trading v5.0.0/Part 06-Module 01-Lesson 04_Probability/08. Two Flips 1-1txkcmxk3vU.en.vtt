00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
That was a tricky question, and you couldn't really know the answer

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
if you've never seen probability before,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
but the answer is 0.25.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And I will derive it for you using something called a truth table.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
In a truth table, you draw out every possible outcome

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
of the experiment that you conducted.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
There were two coin flips--flip 1 and flip 2--and each had

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.000
a possible outcome of heads, heads; heads, tails; tail, heads; and tail, tail.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So when we look at this table, you can see every possible outcome of these two coin flips.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
There happens to be four of them.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And I would argue because heads and tails are equally likely,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
each of these outcomes is equally likely.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Because we know that the probability of all outcomes has to add up to 1,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
we find that each outcome has a chance of a quarter, or, 0.25.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Another way to look at this is the probability of heads followed by heads

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
is the product .

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
What are the chances of the first outcome to be heads

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
multiplied by the probability of the second outcome to be heads?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The first is 0.5, as is the second.

00:01:16.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And if you multiply these two numbers, it's 0.25, or, a quarter.
