00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And, yes, it's in the second case and in the third case.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The extreme cases of heads, heads and tails, tails don't satisfy this condition.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So the trick now has been to take the 0.25 probability of these two cases

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and add them up, which gives us 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5.

00:00:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
This is the number which is correct for this inquiry.
