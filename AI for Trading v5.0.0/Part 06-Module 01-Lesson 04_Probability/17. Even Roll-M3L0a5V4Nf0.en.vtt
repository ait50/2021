00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In truth table-speak, there are 6 outcomes, 1 to 6.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Each has the same probability over six.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Half of those numbers are even--2, 4,  and 6,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
so if we add those up, we get 3  1/6--the same as a half.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The outcomes is 0.5.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Now I'm finally going to make, as my final quiz,

00:00:24.000 --> 99:59:59.000
a really challenging question for you.
