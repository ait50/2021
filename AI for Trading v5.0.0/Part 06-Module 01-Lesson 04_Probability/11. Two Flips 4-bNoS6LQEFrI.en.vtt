00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And, not surprisingly, it's 1.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
That is, the truth table always has a probability that adds up to 1

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
because it considers all possible cases,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and all possible cases together have a probability of 1.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So we just check this and make sure it's correct.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Reading from this table, we find that the probability of (H,H) is 0.36.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And you can do the same over here.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
0.6  0.6 = 0.36

00:00:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So that's our correct answer.
