00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Suppose we throw a fair die twice. What do you think the probability of a double is?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Double means both outcomes are identical with the same number regardless of what that number is.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The actually an important number because in many games involving two dice,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
have different rules when these come up with the same number.

00:00:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So, it might be important to know what the probability is.
