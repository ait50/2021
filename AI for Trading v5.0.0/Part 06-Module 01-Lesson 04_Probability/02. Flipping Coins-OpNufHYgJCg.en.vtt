00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I have here a U.S. dollar coin.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It has two sides, one showing a head and one showing what's called tails.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
In probability, I'm giving a description of this coin, and I'm making data.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We just make data.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
[sound of coin spinning]

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So if we look at the coin, it came up heads.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So I just made a data point of flipping the coin once, and it came up heads.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Let me do it again.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
[sound of coin spinning]

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And--wow! It came up heads again.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So my new data is {heads, heads}.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And you can see how it relates to the data we studied before

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
when we talked about histograms and pie charts and so on.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Let me give it a third try.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
[sound of coin spinning]

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And, unbelievably, it comes up once again heads.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So let me ask a statistical question to test your intuition.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Do you think if I twist this coin more frequently will it always come up heads?

00:01:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And say I try to twist it as fairly as I possibly can.
