00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let me now challenge you

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and give you a loaded coin I flipped twice.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And for this loaded coin, I assumed the probability of heads is 0.6.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
That really changes all of the numbers in the table so far,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
but you can apply the same method of truth tables

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
to arrive at an answer for what is the probability of seeing heads twice

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
under the assumption that the probability of heads equals 0.6?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And I want to do this in steps,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
so rather than asking the question directly,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
let me help you derive it by first asking: What's the probability of tails?
