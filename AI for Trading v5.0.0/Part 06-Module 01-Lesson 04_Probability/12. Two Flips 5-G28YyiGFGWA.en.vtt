00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's now go to the extreme, and this is a challenging probability question.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Suppose the probability of heads is 1,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
so my coin always comes up with heads.

00:00:11.000 --> 99:59:59.000
What is the probability of (H,H)?
