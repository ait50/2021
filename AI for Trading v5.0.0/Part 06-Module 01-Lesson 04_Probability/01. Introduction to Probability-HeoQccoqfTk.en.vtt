00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:08.099
Statistics and probability are different but strongly related fields of mathematics.

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.410
In probability, we make predictions about

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.230
future events based on models or causes that we assume

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.219
whereas in statistics we analyze the data from

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:21.799
the past events to infer what those models or causes could be.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.885
There's almost an opposite relation between these two.

00:00:24.885 --> 00:00:28.665
In one, you're predicting data and in the other,

00:00:28.664 --> 00:00:30.734
you're using data to predict.

00:00:30.734 --> 00:00:35.759
Although not all topics and both fields require an understanding of the other,

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:37.754
you'll need a good understanding in probability

00:00:37.755 --> 00:00:40.260
for the foundation you'll be building in statistics.

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:44.000
With that in mind, let's get started with the basics of probability.
