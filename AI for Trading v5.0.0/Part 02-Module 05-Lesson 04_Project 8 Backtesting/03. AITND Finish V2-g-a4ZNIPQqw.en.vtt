00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.585
Congratulations on finishing AI for Trading ND.

00:00:03.585 --> 00:00:07.830
You have come really far and overcome many challenges and you should be

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.300
really proud of yourself for finishing the project you began months ago.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.769
Now is a great time to take a few moments and reflect on where you were and what you

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:21.824
knew when you started this ND and how many new things you've learned and accomplished.

00:00:21.824 --> 00:00:23.550
Way back in the beginning,

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.005
you learned about momentum,

00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:27.869
mean reversion, portfolio optimization,

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.225
factor modelling, and alpha research.

00:00:30.225 --> 00:00:33.149
Later, you learned about natural language processing,

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.725
neural networks, machine learning for alpha combination, and backtesting.

00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:42.980
You've really come a long way and developed a solid foundation in quant finance.

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:48.184
Thank you so much for sticking with us and for providing us your feedback along the way.

00:00:48.185 --> 00:00:50.420
It's very important to us that we fix and

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.375
improve aspects of the course that are not working for you.

00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:56.929
On the other hand, we like to know what's working well so we can do more of it.

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:59.000
We do really appreciate

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.215
your engagement with us and with the rest of your fellow classmates.

00:01:02.215 --> 00:01:05.030
We read all of the feedback that you send to us,

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.180
and it helps us to better understand your experience and improve

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.965
the course for the students who are following in your footsteps.

00:01:11.965 --> 00:01:16.100
Also, sometimes when we see a nice comment from a happy student,

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:18.619
it makes everyone on our team very happy.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.050
You may be wondering, "What's next?"

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.064
For starters, keep reading financial news,

00:01:24.064 --> 00:01:28.745
keep looking for interesting papers and implement them in code.

00:01:28.745 --> 00:01:33.200
Try online competitions in machine learning or alpha generation to build

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.930
your career portfolio and also to build your community and network.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.630
Practicing and learning is how you get better and smarter.

00:01:41.629 --> 00:01:44.689
So finding opportunities to implement what you've learned and

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.590
stretch the boundaries of your knowledge a little bit more is very important.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.640
Very true. It's normal for many of us to wonder if we'll ever get

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.965
a particular dream job or whether we can really pursue our passion as a career.

00:01:57.965 --> 00:02:02.630
This question naturally comes up more as we approach a learning milestone,

00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:04.914
such as finishing a nanodegree.

00:02:04.915 --> 00:02:08.090
Until recently, I thought that getting paid to do

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.360
what you love was not something most people can hope for.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.920
Over this past year,

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:16.684
I've had a chance to work with a team of people that I really admire,

00:02:16.685 --> 00:02:19.375
building a product I feel passionate about,

00:02:19.375 --> 00:02:21.180
and working to support you,

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.719
our students, whom I really care about.

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:26.780
So now I do think it's possible to find a job that you

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.830
love even if it isn't the one you originally have in mind.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.700
If someone ever tells you that you'll never be this or never do that,

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:38.669
just remember, we spent a good part of this

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:42.875
nanodegree learning about how hard it is to predict the future.

00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:49.909
No one knows for certain what you can or cannot become or what you can or cannot achieve.

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.819
If you find something that you are really passionate about

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.419
and you're willing to spend your evenings and weekends doing it,

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:59.974
then hold onto it and keep improving your skills.

00:02:59.974 --> 00:03:04.215
Then, you'll be ready when a good opportunity comes your way.

00:03:04.215 --> 00:03:08.914
Improving your skills and making progress towards goals is definitely a journey.

00:03:08.914 --> 00:03:12.139
We hope you've enjoyed the journey as much as we have.

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:14.464
Thanks so much, and bye for now.

00:03:14.465 --> 00:03:15.969
Bye.
