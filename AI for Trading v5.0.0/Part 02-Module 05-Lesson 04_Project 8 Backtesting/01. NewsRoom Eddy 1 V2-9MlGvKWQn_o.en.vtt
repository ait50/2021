00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.359
Welcome to the final project of the Nanodegree program.

00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:06.119
You'll get to build a backtester using borrow data,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.000
which is widely used in the quant and finance industry.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.345
We had Gordon here, who designed and built the project.

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:16.950
So, Gordon could you tell us a little bit about your experience in building backtesters?

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.239
Sure. I built a number of backtesting frameworks over the years.

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:24.464
I think the most important thing that an actual quant fund,

00:00:24.464 --> 00:00:27.239
is to have the backtest correspond as closely as

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:31.004
possible to a simulation of how you would actually trade in production,

00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:35.939
and to accurately reflect various sources of costs such as market impact.

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:38.579
Also very important, is that you're

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.280
aware of when you would have known each piece of data.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.359
If it's the last price of the day for example,

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:46.839
you could not have used it to trade on that day.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.510
The soon as you could have used it is the next day.

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:52.219
So, this project is a pretty good foundation for

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.039
what students can do to understand backtesting.

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:57.619
Could you give some suggestions for how they could make

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:00.919
this project their own and add some additional features to it?

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.159
Sure. One thing they could try for starters,

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.375
is to backtest on different time periods and interpret the final results.

00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:11.689
For instance, the year 2007 is quite interesting

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.774
because of the quant crisis that occurred in August of 2007.

00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:21.140
Two thousand eight is also a unique year because of the financial crisis.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.859
In 2008, we expect market neutral strategies such as

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:29.075
the one we are backtesting here to outperform traditional strategies.

00:01:29.075 --> 00:01:31.939
Also, students can try different factors to be

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.120
their alphas in addition to the ones that I chose for the project.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.570
Or even better, invent their own alphas and use those,

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:42.139
including ones they've looked at in previous projects in this course.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.185
There are also other ways to combine the alphas.

00:01:45.185 --> 00:01:50.540
We can go beyond the simple equal weighted alpha combination that I did here.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.720
For example, by choosing different weights for each alpha

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:57.500
based on some metric that tells us how confident we are in that alpha.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.780
Another way to make your project unique,

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.885
is to try to make the transaction cost model more realistic.

00:02:02.885 --> 00:02:05.630
For instance, instead of a unique price impact model,

00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:07.819
you could try a square root impact model.

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.239
To choose the parameters of a square root impact model however,

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.330
I'd recommend reading research papers that study this,

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.715
because they typically have access to large databases of real trades to fit their model.

00:02:19.715 --> 00:02:21.765
One paper I recommend is called,

00:02:21.764 --> 00:02:24.799
Crossover from linear to square-Root market impact.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.810
That's a good overview of different transaction costs models,

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.729
and also references other papers that are useful.

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:34.054
Great. Thanks for your advice on how students can customize the project.

00:02:34.055 --> 00:02:36.819
Is there any other advice you'd like to give to the students?

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.459
Wherever you choose, I just hope you have fun with the project and good luck.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.960
Great. Thanks Gordon.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.930
Good luck to you students.
