00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.020
You've probably heard of stocks and shares before.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.290
In this lesson, we're going to discuss stocks and stock prices.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.664
We'll also clarify the meaning of some of the words you'll hear when discussing them.

00:00:10.664 --> 00:00:14.014
Shares of stock represent fractional ownership in a company.

00:00:14.015 --> 00:00:17.490
If you own one share of a company stock and the stock has been

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:21.719
split into eight shares in total or eight shares outstanding,

00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:23.765
you own one-eighth of the company.

00:00:23.765 --> 00:00:28.890
These days however, companies split their stock into millions or even billions of shares.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.734
Facebook for example, has issued just under three billion shares,

00:00:32.734 --> 00:00:35.174
while Alphabet, the company that owns Google,

00:00:35.174 --> 00:00:37.769
has issued about 700 million shares.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.520
But what does it really mean to own part of a company as a shareholder?

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.570
Can you take the company car out for a spin? Not usually.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.960
There are actually two types of stock,

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.715
common and preferred stock.

00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:52.730
Shareholders who own common stock usually get a portion of

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:57.064
the company's profits in the form of dividends if the company distributes them.

00:00:57.064 --> 00:01:01.129
A dividend is a payment made by a corporation to its investors,

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.400
usually as a distribution of profits.

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:05.689
Shareholders also get the right to vote on

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.614
matters like who should be on the company's board of directors.

00:01:08.614 --> 00:01:11.420
If the company is liquidated due to bankruptcy,

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.530
they also get a portion of

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.319
the remaining assets after all other stakeholders are compensated.

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:20.295
Generally, ownership of shares in publicly traded companies,

00:01:20.295 --> 00:01:23.650
companies whose stock is owned and traded by the general public,

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.594
entails what's called limited liability.

00:01:26.594 --> 00:01:29.765
In part, limited liability means that shareholders

00:01:29.765 --> 00:01:33.140
cannot be made to pay the company's debts if it goes bankrupt.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.829
Shareholders who own preferred stock get a slightly different deal,

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.859
they're promised a fixed amount of income each year and get

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:43.340
paid before owners of common stock get paid dividends,

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.424
but they usually do not have voting rights.

00:01:45.424 --> 00:01:48.619
But of course, one of the main benefits of owning stock is

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.954
the potential opportunity to profit from selling it after it's value has increased.

00:01:52.954 --> 00:01:56.200
These increases in value are called capital gains.
