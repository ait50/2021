00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.129
Let's take a moment to clarify the meaning of

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.669
some words you might hear when discussing stock.

00:00:04.669 --> 00:00:09.155
A security is a financial instrument that has some type of monetary value.

00:00:09.154 --> 00:00:13.320
Some securities that you might have heard of are stocks, bonds, and options.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.510
Securities can be classified into three broad types;

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.655
debt securities, derivative securities, and equity securities.

00:00:20.655 --> 00:00:23.490
Debt securities represent money that is owed and

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:26.264
must be repaid like government or corporate bonds,

00:00:26.265 --> 00:00:27.879
or certificates of deposit.

00:00:27.879 --> 00:00:30.265
Debt securities are also called fixed-income

00:00:30.265 --> 00:00:32.939
securities because they promise a stream of income over

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:35.339
time in the form of interest either at

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.860
a fixed rate or at a rate determined by a specific formula.

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:42.920
Derivative securities such as options or futures contracts are

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.870
so-named because their values depend on the prices of other assets.

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:51.679
For example, an option is a contract which gives the buyer the right but not

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:53.810
the obligation to buy or sell

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.859
an underlying asset at a specified price on a specified date.

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:01.920
An example of an option contract would be employee stock options.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.155
As part of employee incentive programs,

00:01:04.155 --> 00:01:07.340
employers frequently offer employees the option to buy

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.920
companies stock at a lower price called the strike price,

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.560
and later sell it on the open market to make a profit.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.490
On the other hand, a futures contract obligates the buyer to buy or

00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:24.544
the seller to sell an asset at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future.

00:01:24.545 --> 00:01:30.000
For example, say, a dairy farmer concurrently sell milk for $2 a gallon.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.310
Next month, he plans to sell 200 gallons of milk,

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.465
but he's concerned that fluctuations in the market price for milk will erode his profits.

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:42.329
So he enters into a futures contract with an investor.

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.000
By doing so, he is obligated to sell 200 gallons of milk on the agreed date,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.625
but he's guaranteed to receive $400 regardless of the market price of milk at that time.

00:01:54.625 --> 00:01:57.500
This type of agreement would protect him from the risk of

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.424
catastrophic loss if the price of milk tanks,

00:02:00.424 --> 00:02:04.689
but will also limit his ability to profit if the price of milk rises.

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:07.819
Then there's that last category, equity securities.

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:09.709
Let's break that phrase down.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.620
Equity is the value of an owned asset minus

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.784
the amount of all debts or liabilities on that asset.

00:02:15.784 --> 00:02:18.674
So if you own a $15,000 car,

00:02:18.675 --> 00:02:21.285
but you owe a $5,000 loan against it,

00:02:21.284 --> 00:02:23.965
the car represents $10,000 of equity.

00:02:23.965 --> 00:02:27.129
The word equity can have somewhat different meanings in different contexts.

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.689
But in general, you can think of equity as the net value of something owned.

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:36.900
Stocks are called equity securities because they represent ownership in a firm.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.245
One more thing, a security representing

00:02:39.245 --> 00:02:43.330
ownership interest in a private company is called private equity.
