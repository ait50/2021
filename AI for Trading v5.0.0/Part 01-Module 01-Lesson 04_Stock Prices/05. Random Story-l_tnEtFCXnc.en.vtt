00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.734
Hi there. I have a niece,

00:00:02.734 --> 00:00:05.234
Mabel, who's almost three years old.

00:00:05.235 --> 00:00:08.714
I used to love feeding her and carrying her around the park.

00:00:08.714 --> 00:00:10.859
Around the time she was two years old,

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:12.869
whenever I tried to spoon-feed her,

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:17.114
she would grab the spoon in one hand and say, "Mabel self."

00:00:17.114 --> 00:00:20.289
Then she hold a spoon and try to feed herself.

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.570
Same thing when I try to pick her up and take her to the park.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.429
She would start kicking her feet and saying, "Mabel walk."

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:29.190
Then once I put her on the ground,

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.155
she would start walking herself.

00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:34.460
I think it's wonderful that she likes feeling independent.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.090
I think that when we're students and learning something new,

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.000
it's normal to feel stuck and it's tempting to want

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.380
someone to show us the way that will guarantee a solution.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.660
But when we choose more independence and embrace a bit of struggle,

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:51.244
I think that even if we struggle and make mistakes,

00:00:51.244 --> 00:00:53.024
we eventually find the answer.

00:00:53.024 --> 00:00:55.549
The process helps us to feel more

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:59.254
confident in ourselves and leads to more meaningful learning.

00:00:59.255 --> 00:01:01.480
Goodbye for now and good luck.
