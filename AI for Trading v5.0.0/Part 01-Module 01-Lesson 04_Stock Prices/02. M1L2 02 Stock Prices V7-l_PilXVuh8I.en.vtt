00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
So say, you want a chance to reap the potential financial rewards of investment in stock.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.425
Where do you start? Well, usually,

00:00:08.425 --> 00:00:09.720
you find a brokerage.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.010
A brokerage company functions as a middleman connecting buyers and sellers.

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.480
However, they usually charge fees to complete transactions.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.484
It is also sometimes possible to buy stock directly from companies.

00:00:21.484 --> 00:00:25.544
In this case, you don't have to use or pay commissions to a broker,

00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:29.175
but you have less control over the price and timing of your purchase.

00:00:29.175 --> 00:00:33.890
You can't buy or sell at a specific market price or at a specific time.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.210
Typically, the company buys or sells shares for

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.085
the plan at set times and at an average market price,

00:00:39.085 --> 00:00:43.060
but how the shares are purchased depends on the company and the details of the plan.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.679
Once you've bought some stock,

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:47.179
you'll be very interested in the patterns of changes in

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:50.269
its price because in order to make money from your investment,

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.420
you want to sell it when its price is higher than when you bought it.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.564
A great deal of effort has gone into predicting when the price of a stock will go up.

00:00:57.564 --> 00:00:59.265
In order to follow your stock,

00:00:59.265 --> 00:01:01.625
you'll look up its unique symbol or ticker.

00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:04.750
Alphabets unique symbol is GOOG,

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.099
Apples ticker is AAPL.

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:12.184
This is a price graph of Alphabet stock from 2005 until September 2017.

00:01:12.185 --> 00:01:14.725
While the graph seems to progress upwards,

00:01:14.724 --> 00:01:17.254
it isn't a steady or linear climb.

00:01:17.254 --> 00:01:19.939
The history of a stock's price is important and

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.370
potentially an indicator of how the stock will do in the future.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.329
As such, price histories have been studied by

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:29.209
investors and traders since stocks were first traded.

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:30.579
But when was that?

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:33.310
How did all this get started in the first place?

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.510
Some people trace the history of stock back to

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.240
the Roman Republic when the state contracted out many of

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:40.819
its services to private companies which issued

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:43.764
shares to individuals to help with government services.

00:01:43.765 --> 00:01:45.409
In the early 1600s,

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.319
the Dutch East India Company became the first company in

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:52.174
history to issue bonds and shares of stock to the general public.

00:01:52.174 --> 00:01:55.109
The company established the Amsterdam Stock Exchange in

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:58.564
1602 as a forum for trade of securities.

00:01:58.564 --> 00:02:01.670
The Amsterdam Stock Exchange pictured here could

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.614
be called the first incarnation of a modern stock market.

00:02:04.614 --> 00:02:07.640
Patterns in market activity have been studied since markets

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.990
earliest days and some patterns have been observed to repeat.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.735
One of the most interesting market phenomena is the market bubble.

00:02:14.735 --> 00:02:18.110
Bubbles occur when market participants drive stock prices

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.755
above their value in relation to some system evaluation.

00:02:21.754 --> 00:02:23.719
There are notable similarities between

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:28.159
the tulip bulb bubble which took place for centuries ago and saw the value of

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.669
a single tulip bulb grow to nearly 10 times the annual wage of

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:36.294
a skilled worker and the.com bubble which occurred in the early 2000s.

00:02:36.294 --> 00:02:40.219
The similarities in the graphs are fascinating and academics from

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:43.189
behavioral economists to theoretical mathematicians have

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:46.699
devised captivating theories as to why bubbles might happen.

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:50.539
One of the earliest works Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:55.935
Crowds was published by Scottish journalists Charles Mackay way back in 1841.

00:02:55.935 --> 00:02:59.750
If you're interested in reading more about market bubbles or understanding

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.099
the forces driving markets which are not explained by standard quantitative models,

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.400
I'd suggest the work of Robert Shiller and Nassim Taleb.
