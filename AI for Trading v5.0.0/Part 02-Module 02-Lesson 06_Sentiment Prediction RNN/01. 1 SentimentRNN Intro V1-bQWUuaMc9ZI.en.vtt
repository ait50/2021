00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.930
Welcome to this lesson on Sentiment Analysis with an RNN. All right.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.585
So, in this notebook, I want to give you one more LSTM example,

00:00:08.585 --> 00:00:11.365
and in this case, we'll actually be training an RNN to

00:00:11.365 --> 00:00:14.730
solve our sentiment analysis task from a few lessons ago.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.105
Sentiment analysis is all about taking in some text,

00:00:18.105 --> 00:00:19.870
in this case movie reviews,

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.960
and predicting the sentiment of that review.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.690
So, whether it's positive or negative.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.790
Recall that Andrew Trask showed you how to build a sentiment analysis model from scratch,

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.135
and he also did some really cool visualizations with this data.

00:00:33.135 --> 00:00:36.750
What I want to do now is use this as an opportunity to show you

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.675
how well an RNN versus just a feedforward network performs on this task.

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:45.500
My thinking is that an RNN should work really well because

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.625
we can include information about the sequence of words in a movie review.

00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:52.910
I've broken this notebook up into a series of exercises,

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.919
and I'll leave them pretty open-ended.

00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:58.250
You'll be tasked with pre-processing some text data and

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.255
building a model that includes both an embedding and LSTM layer.

00:01:02.255 --> 00:01:05.060
I'll also be showing you a few more things that are useful to

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.075
know about batching data and making predictions.

00:01:08.075 --> 00:01:10.670
Next, you'll be able to access this notebook,

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.550
and I'd suggest that you keep the exercise notebook open.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.080
You can have it open in one tab and watch my exercise and solution videos in another,

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.880
moving back and forth between absorbing information and practicing what you've learned.
