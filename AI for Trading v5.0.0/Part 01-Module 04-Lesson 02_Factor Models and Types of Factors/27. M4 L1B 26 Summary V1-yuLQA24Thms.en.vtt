00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.965
Hey, you made it.

00:00:01.965 --> 00:00:04.155
You've learned quite a lot in this lesson,

00:00:04.155 --> 00:00:08.669
from the principles of factor models to the covariance matrix of factor returns,

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:11.835
to the application of factor models and quant finance.

00:00:11.835 --> 00:00:15.390
Yes. Congrats on building up your understanding of factors.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.109
You've also learned about the distinction between alpha factors and

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.445
risk factors and have an overview of various data sources from which to derive factors.

00:00:24.445 --> 00:00:26.609
This foundation will help you in

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.399
the upcoming lessons where you will learn about risk factor models,

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:33.679
alpha factors, and advanced portfolio optimization.

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:35.840
Yes. Keep up the good work.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.720
See you in the next lesson.
