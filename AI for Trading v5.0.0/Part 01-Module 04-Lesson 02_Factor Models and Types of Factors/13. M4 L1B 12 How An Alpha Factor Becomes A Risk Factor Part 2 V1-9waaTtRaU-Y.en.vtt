00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390
We can see a similar process in the stock market.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:09.015
If you find an Alpha signal that suggests that a stock will have positive future returns,

00:00:09.015 --> 00:00:12.554
the assumption of future higher returns means that the price

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:16.509
today is lower then the expected future price.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.715
In other words, its current market price is cheap according to the signal.

00:00:21.714 --> 00:00:24.410
If you buy it now at this price,

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.640
and if your hypothesis was accurate,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.190
you'll be expecting the price to rise in the future.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.695
Now, what if lots of other investors also find

00:00:33.695 --> 00:00:37.835
the same signal and also decide to buy the stock now?

00:00:37.835 --> 00:00:41.770
The buying activity will push the stock price higher.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.445
So, by the time you get around to buying yourself,

00:00:44.445 --> 00:00:46.414
the price has already risen.

00:00:46.414 --> 00:00:48.439
If you buy it like everyone else,

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:52.354
you may find that it doesn't produce the positive return you were hoping for.

00:00:52.354 --> 00:00:56.449
This is an example of the efficient market hypothesis,

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.975
which states that assets are fairly priced based on publicly available information.

00:01:01.975 --> 00:01:06.810
The factor is no longer helping to drive the mean return of our investments.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.030
Instead, the factor is triggering the market price to move because

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.424
it is known and being used for trade decisions by many other investors.

00:01:15.424 --> 00:01:18.430
So this factor is now driving the movement of the stock.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.675
Every time the factor signal changes,

00:01:20.674 --> 00:01:23.355
the market price also changes soon after.

00:01:23.355 --> 00:01:27.200
We now say that the factor is a risk factor.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.400
So in summary, good Alpha factors enable us to find

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.090
mispricings and seek a competitive edge in the market,

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.480
which drives the mean return of a portfolio.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.660
When Alpha factors become two well-known,

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.780
then they end up triggering the market to move as a changes,

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.659
which drives the variance of our portfolio's return,

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.804
but no longer the mean of the return.

00:01:49.805 --> 00:01:52.115
So now it's a risk factor.

00:01:52.114 --> 00:01:57.829
Market participants historically have had to use their judgment and experience to decide

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:03.670
which factors to use as Alpha factors and which factors to use as risk factors.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.375
Can we use AI to do this instead?

00:02:06.375 --> 00:02:12.759
Yes we can. We'll go in depth into Alpha factor combination in term two.
