00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
We generally observe different attributes among risk factors versus alpha factors.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.300
Even though factors fall along a graded incremental spectrum of these attributes,

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.960
it helps to put them into two groups to get

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.469
a sense of how risk factors and alpha factors differ.

00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:19.289
One difference is in the magnitude of

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.619
the factors contribution to the stock's price movement.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.330
When we choose a set of

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:28.914
20 or so risk factors that explain a good portion of the variance of stocks,

00:00:28.914 --> 00:00:31.070
then taken as a whole,

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.164
these risk factors tend to be major contributors to the price movement of most stocks.

00:00:36.164 --> 00:00:39.060
These are factors such as the market return,

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.340
the country in which the company operates,

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.350
the sector or line of business,

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.170
and interest rates set by central bank.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.579
In comparison, a single alpha factor may

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.939
have a smaller contribution to a stock's price movement.

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:58.670
As an example, the book-to-market ratio multiplied by idiosyncratic volatility

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:05.909
or the trajectory of a stock's return over time are examples of potential alpha factors.

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.969
You will actually get an in-depth look at these two alpha factors in a later lesson.

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:16.084
But for now just assume that we're talking about two examples of alpha factors.

00:01:16.084 --> 00:01:20.564
The contribution of these alpha factors may be statistically significant,

00:01:20.564 --> 00:01:22.209
but in terms of magnitude,

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:24.559
their impact on the variance of the stock may be

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.990
smaller than that of a set of common risk factors.

00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:31.699
This is an important reason for why we want to find

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.564
a useful set of risk factors and neutralize our portfolio's exposure to them.

00:01:36.564 --> 00:01:41.269
If we didn't, then the portfolio's movements due to these risk factors would

00:01:41.269 --> 00:01:46.840
likely be so large as to overwhelm the effects of the alpha factors.
