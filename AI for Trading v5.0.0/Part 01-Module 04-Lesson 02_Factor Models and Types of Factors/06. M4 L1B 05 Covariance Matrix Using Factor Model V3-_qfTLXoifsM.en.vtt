00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.690
Okay. We talked about the assumptions inherent to factor models.

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.740
Now, let's derive the covariance matrix of the returns,

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.705
in terms of the factor returns,

00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:12.155
exposures, and residual term.

00:00:12.154 --> 00:00:15.000
We need this description of the return variants,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.730
because we want to be able to use our factor model to

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.699
describe and manage the portfolio variance,

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.954
and use this information for optimization.

00:00:23.954 --> 00:00:27.594
We'll need to use the two assumptions; one,

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:31.824
that the residual of any asset is uncorrelated with the factor returns,

00:00:31.824 --> 00:00:34.969
and two, that the residual of any asset is

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.490
uncorrelated with the residual of any other asset.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:44.465
Before we begin, we subtract from each asset random variable its mean.

00:00:44.465 --> 00:00:49.350
Such that the mean of this shifted return distribution is zero.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.689
We start with this equation,

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:54.349
which is a factor model of the stock return.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.450
If there are many assets then r is a vector of observable random variables.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.050
What I mean by that is,

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:06.750
r1 is a random variable that represents the return of asset one.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.409
It can take on any value with a probability determined by a probability distribution.

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.638
R, is a vector of length equal to the number of assets.

00:01:17.638 --> 00:01:23.524
B, is a matrix of fixed that is not random coefficients,

00:01:23.525 --> 00:01:27.255
it has dimensions of assets by factors.

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:30.774
F, is a vector of random variables,

00:01:30.775 --> 00:01:34.450
each of which represents the value of a factor return.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.855
Finally, this is the vector of residuals.

00:01:37.855 --> 00:01:40.640
Which as we said, are specific to the assets.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.655
So, there is a residual random variable for each asset.

00:01:44.655 --> 00:01:49.978
Now, we want to calculate the covariance matrix of the asset returns.

00:01:49.978 --> 00:01:52.459
Remember, that the covariance of

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:55.924
two random variables can be calculated with this formula.

00:01:55.924 --> 00:01:59.420
But if the means of the two random variables are zero,

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.700
this simplifies to the expectation value of their product.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.579
The expectation value of a matrix is just a matrix

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:12.014
with the expectation value operator applied to each element.

00:02:12.014 --> 00:02:15.794
The matrix of products of asset returns,

00:02:15.794 --> 00:02:18.299
is just rr transpose.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.710
So, the covariance matrix can be written as the expectation value of rr transpose.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.425
This follows by our model for r.

00:02:28.425 --> 00:02:33.689
First, distribute the transpose to the two terms on the right.

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:37.954
Here, we just expand out the matrix product.

00:02:37.955 --> 00:02:41.575
Now, distribute the transposes.

00:02:41.574 --> 00:02:45.679
We can pull the B matrix out of the expectation function,

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.290
because it is not a random variable, it is fixed.

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:52.594
Here, we use the fact that the residual errors

00:02:52.594 --> 00:02:55.909
and factor returns are assumed to be uncorrelated.

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.609
The first assumption we discussed earlier.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.075
This means that the expected value of the factor returns times the errors is zero.

00:03:04.074 --> 00:03:06.269
So, the two terms in the middle becomes zero.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.755
We will now simplify our notation

00:03:09.754 --> 00:03:13.810
to represent the covariance matrix of the factor returns.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.194
Finally, we write down the covariance matrix of the residuals,

00:03:18.194 --> 00:03:20.704
which we know to be a diagonal matrix.

00:03:20.705 --> 00:03:25.240
Meaning that only the variances of the residuals may be nonzero,

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.485
but the covariances between residuals of different assets are zero.

00:03:29.485 --> 00:03:32.920
The reason for this, is the second assumption from earlier;

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:37.854
that the error random variables are assumed to be uncorrelated across assets.

00:03:37.854 --> 00:03:40.399
So, their covariances are zero.
