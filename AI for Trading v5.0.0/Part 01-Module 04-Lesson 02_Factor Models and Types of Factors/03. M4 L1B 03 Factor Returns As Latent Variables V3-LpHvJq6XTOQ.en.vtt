00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.134
We left off with the idea that the return of any stock, i,

00:00:04.134 --> 00:00:07.849
can be decomposed into the returns of factors times

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:12.614
the stocks exposures to those factors plus an unexplained portion.

00:00:12.615 --> 00:00:16.875
But wait, this is looking a lot like multiple regression.

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:18.320
What's the difference?

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.420
Well, regression is one tool you might use to build a factor model.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.600
Also, in a factor model,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:31.020
the independent variables or factor returns are usually things we think are there,

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.079
but have an influence that we can't measure directly.

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.619
These are called unobserved or latent random variables.

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:41.419
We may need to take other steps to produce

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.370
these time series before we can run a multiple regression.

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:48.019
For example, what if we think

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.620
a company's size has something to do with the performance of its stock price?

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:57.424
Maybe, smaller companies stock prices produced higher returns?

00:00:57.424 --> 00:00:59.394
Okay. That seems reasonable,

00:00:59.395 --> 00:01:01.355
so let's do a regression.

00:01:01.354 --> 00:01:04.325
But hang on, what data do we have?

00:01:04.325 --> 00:01:07.609
We have time series of returns for several stocks.

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:09.625
You've seen those data before.

00:01:09.625 --> 00:01:13.364
Okay. So size, how do we measure that?

00:01:13.364 --> 00:01:18.149
Lets say, we're specifically thinking that market cap is the metric of interests.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.505
Market cap is the market value of a publicly traded companies outstanding shares.

00:01:23.504 --> 00:01:27.250
It's the share price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.040
So, we'd have market cap for every company in our universe for every day,

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.330
because it changes over time.

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.700
That sounds like the data could be organized in a table or a matrix.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.915
But to create a single factor return time-series,

00:01:42.915 --> 00:01:46.150
we're looking for a single time-series of values that

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.585
represents the effect of the size factor across stocks.

00:01:50.584 --> 00:01:52.709
Do you see the challenge we're facing?

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:56.500
How do we create a single time series that represents our idea

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.754
that small-cap companies generally outperform large-cap companies.

00:02:00.754 --> 00:02:06.390
Moreover, how do we quantify this effect on the returns of a whole set of stocks?

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.020
A latent variable is something like this,

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.040
something nebulous that we want to represent as a time series like a normal variable,

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:16.484
but it's hard to directly measure.

00:02:16.485 --> 00:02:21.080
What we do in this case to create a single time series for our factor,

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.735
is we create a theoretical portfolio.

00:02:23.735 --> 00:02:28.560
This portfolio long small caps and shorts large-caps every day.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.125
The time series we seek is the portfolio's daily return.

00:02:33.125 --> 00:02:37.219
This is how we quantify our idea that small caps should outperform

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:41.930
large-caps and generate a single time series to represent this idea.
