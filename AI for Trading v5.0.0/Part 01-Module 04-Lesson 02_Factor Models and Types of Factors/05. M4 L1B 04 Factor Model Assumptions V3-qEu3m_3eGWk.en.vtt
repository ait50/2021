00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.384
There are a couple of assumptions inherent to strict factor models.

00:00:04.384 --> 00:00:07.349
The first is that the residual return is assumed to

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:10.675
be uncorrelated with each of the factor returns.

00:00:10.675 --> 00:00:15.894
This does not restrict the set of possible models as much as it may seem.

00:00:15.894 --> 00:00:18.960
The factor exposures can be adjusted to achieve

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.214
the condition where the residuals are uncorrelated with the factor returns.

00:00:23.214 --> 00:00:26.614
In fact, in simple settings using historic data,

00:00:26.614 --> 00:00:30.000
this can be achieved with multiple regression procedures.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.140
The key assumption of a linear factor model is that the residual for

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.149
one asset's return is uncorrelated with the residual of any other asset.

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.350
This means that the only correlations among

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.000
asset total returns are those that arise due to their exposures to the factors.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.380
The residual component of an asset's return is assumed to

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.660
be unrelated to the residual of any other asset,

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:57.634
and hence totally specific to that asset.

00:00:57.634 --> 00:01:01.489
In other words, the risk associated with the residual return is

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.034
specific to or idiosyncratic to the asset in question.

00:01:06.034 --> 00:01:10.280
This assumption makes a linear factor model powerful in

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.450
the sense that it rules out many possible combinations of outcomes.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.825
But this power comes at a cost.

00:01:16.825 --> 00:01:18.885
The more restrictive a model is,

00:01:18.885 --> 00:01:21.305
the greater the chance that it may be wrong.

00:01:21.305 --> 00:01:24.445
For this reason, if using a strict factor model,

00:01:24.444 --> 00:01:28.279
it is important to try to account for the most important sources of

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.314
correlations by including a sufficient number of factors,

00:01:32.314 --> 00:01:36.390
while also attempting to include only the most important ones.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.340
That said, there's also value to simplicity in modeling,

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.270
since the goal is always to model signal and not noise.
