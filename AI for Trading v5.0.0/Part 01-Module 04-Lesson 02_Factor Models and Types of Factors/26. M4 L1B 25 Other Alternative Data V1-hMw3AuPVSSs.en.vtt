00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.530
Alternative data could be generated by scraping social media profiles of companies,

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.660
tracking building permits or hospital purchases,

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.500
and analyzing satellite imagery to name a few examples.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.929
Construction companies file permit requests with

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.300
local governments when installing components of

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.280
a house and also when upgrading components.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.560
This information could be tracked to better understand the housing market.

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:31.309
Some hospitals provide information about purchases of medical equipment and supplies.

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:33.990
This could also be used to assess the sales of

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.065
companies that supply medical equipment to these hospitals.

00:00:38.064 --> 00:00:43.218
These days, companies have public profiles in major social media platforms.

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.980
Information about their employee count, job postings,

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:49.089
employee ratings of the company,

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.414
store locations, number of social media followers,

00:00:52.414 --> 00:00:55.145
number of active users of their mobile apps,

00:00:55.145 --> 00:00:57.255
number of check-ins by customers,

00:00:57.255 --> 00:01:02.980
and so on, these can be tracked over time to gain insights into a company.

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:06.299
An interesting hypothesis is that companies,

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.500
which are struggling with reduced sales,

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.450
may be more likely to increase marketing on social media.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.250
So, it's possible to look for

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.359
recent increased marketing efforts as a potential alpha factor.

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:23.299
Satellite images can also be used to get a high level overview of parking lots,

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.784
mining sites, oil rigs,

00:01:25.784 --> 00:01:28.814
shipping ports, and construction zones.

00:01:28.814 --> 00:01:32.149
A retailer's customer base can be estimated

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.495
from counting how many cars visit their retail stores.

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:39.279
Empty parking lots likely suggest fewer customers,

00:01:39.278 --> 00:01:45.144
full parking lots suggest more customers and potentially more sales as well.

00:01:45.144 --> 00:01:49.984
In fact, the parking lot data generated by a startup, Orbital Insight,

00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:57.055
closely tracked the downward trend of JC Penney's stock price from 2012 to 2017.

00:01:57.055 --> 00:02:02.155
Crude oil storage can be tracked by analyzing satellite and drone images.

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:07.055
Now, you may be wondering why oil storage is relevant if you're trading equities.

00:02:07.055 --> 00:02:10.895
Well, crude oil storage is tracked closely

00:02:10.895 --> 00:02:15.015
in order for oil traders to set prices on a barrel of oil.

00:02:15.014 --> 00:02:18.949
Storage of commodities in general gives an indication of

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:23.324
how much is being produced relative to how much is being consumed.

00:02:23.324 --> 00:02:27.229
Prices are based on both supply and demand.

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:30.199
Storage levels and changes in

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:34.009
storage levels provide a signal about both supply and demand,

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:36.840
and therefore a signal about the price.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.039
Price changes of oil trickles down to impact

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:43.995
the operation costs of any businesses that rely on petroleum,

00:02:43.995 --> 00:02:46.675
jet fuel, gasoline, diesel,

00:02:46.675 --> 00:02:50.450
heating oil, and other products that are derived from crude oil.

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:53.133
These include airlines, trucking,

00:02:53.133 --> 00:02:56.269
shipping, and utility companies to name a few.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.689
In the US, oil traders closely monitor

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:02.990
the weekly oil and natural gas storage reports issued

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.955
by the Energy Information Administration or EIA.

00:03:06.955 --> 00:03:10.340
The EIA surveys crude oil stockholders,

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.390
which may use floating roof tanks,

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:15.504
fixed roof tanks, underground caverns,

00:03:15.504 --> 00:03:20.120
trains, trucks, and pipelines to store crude oil.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.300
Some companies have also looked into tracking oil pipeline

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.810
flows in order to estimate changes in crude oil storage levels.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.585
With aerial footage, it's possible to track floating roof tank storage levels.

00:03:33.585 --> 00:03:39.860
Floating roof tanks are cylinders with a roof that floats on top of the stored oil.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.900
Computer imaging can track shadows to estimate the height of these roofs and

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.039
subsequently estimate the volume of crude oil stored in a floating roof tank.

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:53.840
Orbital Insight produces energy storage estimates based on

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.039
his analysis of this image data for the US, OPEC, and China.
