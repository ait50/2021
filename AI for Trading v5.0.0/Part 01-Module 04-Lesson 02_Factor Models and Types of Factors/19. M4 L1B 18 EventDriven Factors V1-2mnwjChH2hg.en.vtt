00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.185
The previous factors that we've seen,

00:00:02.185 --> 00:00:04.650
such as price and volume, book-to-market,

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.140
and analyst forecasts, tend to occur at regular intervals,

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.080
whether it's daily or quarterly.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.890
Another class of factors are based on events that may not be

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.885
scheduled and may have a significant impact on the stock price.

00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:24.705
For example, when the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010,

00:00:24.704 --> 00:00:27.629
British Petroleum saw its share price drop from

00:00:27.629 --> 00:00:31.929
$60 to under $30 per share over the next 40 days.

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:36.865
In 2016, when Microsoft announced its intention to acquire LinkedIn,

00:00:36.865 --> 00:00:40.660
the share price of LinkedIn jumped almost 50 percent on that day,

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:44.024
while Microsoft shares decreased by three percent.

00:00:44.024 --> 00:00:48.604
Events can be either macro level events such as natural disasters,

00:00:48.604 --> 00:00:50.339
major changes in government,

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.160
or changes in interest rates by central bank.

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:57.479
Events can also be corporate events such as mergers and acquisitions,

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:00.439
spinoffs, and new product announcements.

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:03.949
Still other common events are index ads or

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.135
index deletions and even weight changes for major indices.

00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:12.870
Many kinds of events are one-off and rare events, but some,

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.450
such as earnings releases, earnings guidance,

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.520
and product announcements, can be expected with some regularity.
