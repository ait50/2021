00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.965
In the history of finance,

00:00:01.965 --> 00:00:04.304
there has been a continued search to find

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:08.144
new sources of information and to derive meaning from them.

00:00:08.144 --> 00:00:10.699
For instance, before the 1980s,

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:14.354
stock traders used to get their financial data from newspapers.

00:00:14.355 --> 00:00:18.420
However, stock exchanges began to use computers to automate

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.940
their record keeping and Bloomberg terminals were

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.984
invented to deliver financial data directly to trading desks.

00:00:24.984 --> 00:00:28.739
Similarly, finance professionals had been collecting and analyzing

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:32.984
data that goes beyond financial statements and stock quotes.

00:00:32.984 --> 00:00:38.060
These include data collected on the Internet such as social media or online reviews.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.440
This also includes satellite images,

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:43.594
consumer transactions, and mobile app usage.

00:00:43.594 --> 00:00:47.089
Any data that are relatively new sources for generating

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.580
trading signals such as data not including price volume,

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.899
financial statements, or analysts reports are referred to as alternative data.
