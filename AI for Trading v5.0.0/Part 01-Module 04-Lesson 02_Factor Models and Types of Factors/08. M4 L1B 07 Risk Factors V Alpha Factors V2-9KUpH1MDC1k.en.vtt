00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180
In the coming series of lessons,

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.429
we'll go into detail about risk factors and alpha factors.

00:00:06.429 --> 00:00:07.835
So, what's the difference,

00:00:07.835 --> 00:00:10.070
and why do we make this distinction?

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.935
First, let's start with how factors,

00:00:12.935 --> 00:00:16.670
whether risk factors or alpha factors, are the same.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.900
The use of factors this is based on the assumption that stocks

00:00:20.899 --> 00:00:25.649
with similar characteristics may move up or down in similar ways.

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:28.159
For example, stocks may exhibit

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.998
similar price movements if they are also within the same sector

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:38.725
or are similar in market cap or based in the same country or have similar fundamentals.

00:00:38.725 --> 00:00:42.649
Factors represent these common characteristics such as sector,

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.509
market cap, or market return or the country or book-to-market ratio.

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:51.049
If we model the return of a stock as the sum of

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:55.228
the contributions from risk factors and alpha factors,

00:00:55.228 --> 00:00:57.560
then we notice that each of these factors,

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.145
both alpha and risk factors,

00:00:59.145 --> 00:01:01.330
contribute to the stock return.

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.825
In other words, each factor is adding a little bit to the movement of the stock price.

00:01:06.825 --> 00:01:10.130
However, in practice, risk factors and

00:01:10.129 --> 00:01:13.984
alpha factors are used to accomplish different goals.

00:01:13.984 --> 00:01:17.420
We want to use factors to help us learn something

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.605
about the distribution of expected future returns.

00:01:21.605 --> 00:01:28.760
Factors could be predictive of the mean of the distribution of expected returns or not.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.359
They could also help to explain a significant amount of

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:36.560
the variance of the return distribution or not.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.219
Factors that significantly help explain the variance of

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:44.939
the return distribution are candidates for use as risk factors.

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:51.584
We want to find a set of risk factors that explain much of the variance of a portfolio.

00:01:51.584 --> 00:01:55.279
The reason is so that we can adjust portfolio weights to

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.335
reduce that variance that's caused by these risk factors.

00:01:59.334 --> 00:02:03.679
Reducing the movement of a portfolio that may be attributed to

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.055
risk factors is how we control portfolio risk.

00:02:08.055 --> 00:02:13.879
One major risk factor is the market return from the capital asset pricing model.

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:19.519
We saw earlier how adjusting portfolio weights to make them dollar neutral also helps

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.735
to make a portfolio less sensitive to overall market movement thereby controlling risk.

00:02:25.735 --> 00:02:30.010
Factors that are significantly predictive of the mean of the return of

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:34.259
distribution are candidates for use as alpha factors.

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:37.780
We want to find alpha factors that are predictive of

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.469
future price movements after we've neutralized price movements using a risk model.

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:46.870
For example, if a factor signals that

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.020
the mean of the expected return distribution is greater than zero,

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.700
then this signal may indicate that the stock return will be

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:59.594
positive in the future which also means it's a signal to buy.

00:02:59.594 --> 00:03:04.794
One example of a former alpha factor is the market cap of a stock.

00:03:04.794 --> 00:03:11.324
Small-cap stocks tend to have higher returns compared to large cap stocks.

00:03:11.324 --> 00:03:16.399
Factors that are neither useful in explaining the variance nor predictive or the mean

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.615
of the return distribution would probably not be used as either alpha or risk factors.

00:03:21.615 --> 00:03:25.010
One example would be days when there are full moons.

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:27.219
Even though a full moon may tell you when to

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:30.484
expect werewolves or other magical creatures to appear,

00:03:30.485 --> 00:03:34.400
it probably wouldn't tell you much about which stocks to long or short.
