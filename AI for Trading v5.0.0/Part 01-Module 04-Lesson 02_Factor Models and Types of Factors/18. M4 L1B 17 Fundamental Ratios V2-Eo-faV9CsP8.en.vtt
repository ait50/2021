00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.934
Many fundamental factors are different variations of the price to earnings ratio.

00:00:04.934 --> 00:00:09.149
Note that [inaudible] typically use the data measured as earnings per

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.339
share divided by price instead of price divided by earnings.

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:18.160
Why? Earnings could be zero or close to zero.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.240
So, the data using price divided by earnings may end

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:24.875
up with numbers close to infinity or even null values.

00:00:24.875 --> 00:00:30.000
Using earnings divided by price helps to reduce these kinds of data issues.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.570
The book to price ratio may be

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.799
a good alternative to earnings divided by price because earnings

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:39.529
may be negative while book to price ratios remain

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.820
positive as long as the company's net asset value is positive.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.740
Other variations of fundamental ratios try to remove accounting choices

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.820
from the metric by looking at direct cash flows instead of earnings.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.384
Example of these include cash flow,

00:00:56.384 --> 00:01:00.545
earnings before interest, tax depreciation, and amortization.

00:01:00.545 --> 00:01:03.440
You don't need to dive into accounting for this lesson,

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:07.144
but it helps to get a sense of how earnings are different from cash flow.

00:01:07.144 --> 00:01:12.340
Cash flow is the amount of cash flowing into and out of a company.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.015
The cash flow can be a more volatile metric than earnings,

00:01:16.015 --> 00:01:19.875
but it's also more difficult for company executives to manipulate.

00:01:19.875 --> 00:01:22.340
Cash flow maybe more volatile due to

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.495
large upfront capital costs such as buying expensive equipment.

00:01:26.495 --> 00:01:29.900
Accounting smooths out the earnings by spreading out

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.500
the cost of these purchases over the lifetime of the asset.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.760
So, earning numbers are more smooth and less jumpy compared to cash flow.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.510
The earnings numbers come from the interpretations of

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.995
accounting rules and there can be some judgment in applying these accounting rules.

00:01:45.995 --> 00:01:48.420
This is not the case with cash.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.060
With cash, it's either there or it isn't.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.719
Since accountants decide how to spread out the initial purchase over time,

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:01.390
there is a human element in earnings that may add noise to the data.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.960
Whereas cash flows are a more direct measure of the state of the company's finances.
