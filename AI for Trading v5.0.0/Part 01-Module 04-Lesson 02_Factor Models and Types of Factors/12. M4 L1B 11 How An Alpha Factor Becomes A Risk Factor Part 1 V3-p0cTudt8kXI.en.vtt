00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.404
Alpha factors eventually lose their performance

00:00:03.404 --> 00:00:06.695
as they become more publicly known among investors,

00:00:06.695 --> 00:00:09.615
and then eventually become risk factors.

00:00:09.615 --> 00:00:14.585
Let's look at an analogy to help frame our discussion of how this happens.

00:00:14.585 --> 00:00:19.050
Let's say I drive to work and I normally deal with a lot of traffic.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.875
So, I download this cool new app that tells me which lane I should choose,

00:00:23.875 --> 00:00:26.390
that will let me get to work faster.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.830
Since I'm one of the few people who has downloaded and used the app so far,

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.280
I'm able to find lanes that have fewer cars and

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.365
move through traffic a little bit faster than the other drivers.

00:00:39.365 --> 00:00:42.950
You can think of this app as my alpha factor,

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.595
because it's helping me improve my performance on the road.

00:00:46.594 --> 00:00:50.259
Now let's say this app becomes really popular.

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:56.049
So, most other drivers now use it to help them find the fastest lane.

00:00:56.049 --> 00:01:00.464
Now, when the app tells me to take a particular lane,

00:01:00.465 --> 00:01:04.590
many other drivers next to me also get the same signal,

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.549
so they also choose that same lane.

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.829
Many drivers actually get into the lane before or at the same time that I do,

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:16.769
so I no longer have the ability to get ahead of the other drivers.

00:01:16.769 --> 00:01:20.359
Moreover, since everyone is following this app,

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:23.989
the app is now driving the variance of these cars on the road.

00:01:23.989 --> 00:01:28.759
You can imagine many cars now constantly changing lanes concurrently,

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.094
as a group like a school of fish, and yes,

00:01:32.094 --> 00:01:35.504
I just used a fish analogy to explain the car analogy,

00:01:35.504 --> 00:01:38.704
which in turn I'm using to explain alpha factors.

00:01:38.704 --> 00:01:42.560
We can now think of this driving app as a risk factor,

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.814
because it is driving the movement of many cars, and therefore,

00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:52.129
the variance, but is no longer helping any of us improve our individual performance.
