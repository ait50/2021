00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.919
Welcome to this lesson.

00:00:01.919 --> 00:00:06.040
Now that you've seen an example of a factor and how to create one from data,

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.129
we'll give you a closer look at the theory

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.320
behind these methods by introducing the factor model.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.839
This will help you understand

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:16.984
the broader context around what you're doing when you work with factors.

00:00:16.984 --> 00:00:21.394
After that, we' ll walk you through some major categories of factors.

00:00:21.394 --> 00:00:23.954
These are factors such as price volume,

00:00:23.954 --> 00:00:27.864
fundamentals, sentiment, and alternative factors.

00:00:27.864 --> 00:00:29.234
Ready, ready.

00:00:29.234 --> 00:00:31.414
Ready. Ready, Liz?

00:00:31.414 --> 00:00:32.570
I sure am.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.079
Cool. Let's do this.
