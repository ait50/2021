00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
Another descriptive attributes of common risk factors,

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.099
is that they are well known by the investment community.

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:08.539
This is not just a descriptive attribute,

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:12.514
it also affects how risk factors drive price movements.

00:00:12.515 --> 00:00:15.750
When most of the investors in the market understand

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.929
how a factor drives the price movement of a stock,

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:21.285
then it's unlikely that anyone will gain

00:00:21.285 --> 00:00:27.460
a competitive advantage in generating higher than expected returns based on that factor.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.655
Why is that? Because investors who are seeking to maintain

00:00:31.655 --> 00:00:36.200
a competitive position will monitor the movements of these risk factors,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.865
and we'll adjust their portfolios in response to changes in these factors.

00:00:40.865 --> 00:00:45.140
Researchers have looked into how the performance of funds that use

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.585
particular factors declines after those factors are widely published in academic papers.

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:56.149
For example, the findings that small-cap stocks tend to have

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.734
higher returns than large-cap stocks is also known as the size effect.

00:01:01.734 --> 00:01:07.299
Research that details this effect was first published in 1981.

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:11.914
A mutual fund was actually created to make use of the size factor

00:01:11.915 --> 00:01:17.170
and it was called the dimensional fund advisor small company portfolio.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.004
In a study conducted in 2003,

00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:26.174
researchers showed how this particular funds performance after the 1981 publication,

00:01:26.174 --> 00:01:31.099
no longer generated abnormal returns based on the size factor.

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:34.939
One likely explanation, is that the act of publishing

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:38.859
the size factor and its ability to generate abnormal returns,

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:44.144
made the size factor well-known to practitioners at investment funds.

00:01:44.144 --> 00:01:47.979
The practitioners then acted on this knowledge and over time,

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.495
traded away this mispricing.

00:01:50.495 --> 00:01:54.124
That is one consequence of being risk factors.

00:01:54.123 --> 00:01:58.469
They're not likely to be used to enhance the portfolio return.

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.719
In other words, risk factors may give an indication for how much

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:06.789
the portfolio stocks bounce up and down like boats without sails,

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.090
moving up and down with the ocean waves.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.215
However, just as a boat without sales

00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:15.985
can't drive its average position in a particular direction,

00:02:15.985 --> 00:02:22.215
an investor won't use risk factors to drive their returns in a particular direction.

00:02:22.215 --> 00:02:24.125
To summarize the idea,

00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:28.080
we say that risk factors are drivers of portfolio variance,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.440
but not drivers of the portfolio's mean return.
