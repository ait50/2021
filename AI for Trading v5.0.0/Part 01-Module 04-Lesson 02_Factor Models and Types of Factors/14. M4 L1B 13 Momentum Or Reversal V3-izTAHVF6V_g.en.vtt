00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.254
Factors can be broadly categorized as either momentum or reversal factors.

00:00:05.254 --> 00:00:09.269
We've previously referred to reversal as mean reversion.

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.154
A momentum factor suggests that an existing trend will continue.

00:00:14.154 --> 00:00:20.335
A reversal factor suggests that a trend will change and go in the other direction.

00:00:20.335 --> 00:00:22.859
Say we have a hypothesis that

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.129
the trend of stocks one year return will continue in the same direction.

00:00:27.129 --> 00:00:31.785
In other words, winners keep on winning and losers keep on losing.

00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:35.585
Let's call it a one-year return momentum factor.

00:00:35.585 --> 00:00:40.825
When the one year return is higher for stock A compared to stock B,

00:00:40.825 --> 00:00:44.010
this indicates that we expect stock A to have

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:47.809
a higher near-term return compared to stock B.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.140
Now, let's look at a possible reversal factor.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.825
Say our hypothesis is that weekly stock returns are being reverting, that is,

00:00:56.825 --> 00:00:58.970
when a stock increases over a week,

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.015
we expect that it will give up some of those gains due to profit taking.

00:01:03.015 --> 00:01:06.200
What I mean by profit taking is that other investors may

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.814
sell after recent price gains in order to lock in their profits.

00:01:10.814 --> 00:01:16.495
So, the weekly return for stock A is higher than the weekly return for stock B,

00:01:16.495 --> 00:01:22.385
then we expect future returns on stock A to be lower compared to stock B.

00:01:22.385 --> 00:01:26.385
Similarly, if the weekly return of a stock is negative,

00:01:26.385 --> 00:01:30.050
our hypothesis assumes that the stock may be oversold.

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:35.704
It might trend backup as other investors try to buy the stock at a cheaper price.

00:01:35.704 --> 00:01:39.484
So, to write these calculated returns as factors,

00:01:39.484 --> 00:01:42.810
the momentum factor is just the one year return,

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.430
whereas the reversal factor is the negative of the weekly return.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.540
Remember, that a factor is some manipulation of raw data plus

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.290
a hypothesis on what that data means in

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.469
terms of the relative future performance of the assets.
