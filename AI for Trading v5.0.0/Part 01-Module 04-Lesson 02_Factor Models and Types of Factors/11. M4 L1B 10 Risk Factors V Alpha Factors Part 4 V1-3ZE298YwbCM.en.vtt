00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.285
Now in contrast, alpha factors are,

00:00:03.285 --> 00:00:08.419
generally speaking, not yet well known by the majority of the investment community.

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:14.460
The community's limited awareness of an alpha factor also affects how it can be used,

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.190
because those who generate and use proprietary alpha factors can use them to

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.725
potentially seek a competitive edge in generating better than average performance.

00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:28.070
Let's say we find an alpha factor defined as

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.565
the maximum single day return over the past month.

00:00:31.565 --> 00:00:34.914
According to the hypothesis of this alpha factor,

00:00:34.914 --> 00:00:39.810
the higher the single day maximum return in a recent window of time,

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.945
the more likely the stock will have a lower return in the near future.

00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:48.295
We'll examine this alpha factor in a later lesson.

00:00:48.295 --> 00:00:52.070
For now, just assume that we have an alpha factor that

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.164
gives us an indication of the future price movements of the stock.

00:00:56.164 --> 00:01:02.530
Also assume that most others in the investment community are not yet using this factor.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:09.409
So, if we see a stock exhibit a high single day maximum in a recent window of time,

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.679
we may decide to trade based on that signal,

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.955
expecting the stock to have lower returns in the near future.

00:01:16.954 --> 00:01:20.299
Since others are not doing the same as we are,

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.685
this alpha factor essentially gives us

00:01:22.685 --> 00:01:27.064
the potential opportunity to act on that signal before others do,

00:01:27.064 --> 00:01:31.754
thereby helping us in our quest to seek better than average performance.

00:01:31.754 --> 00:01:37.324
Since alpha factors can potentially help an investor seek better than average returns,

00:01:37.325 --> 00:01:43.495
then we also say that alpha factors are drivers of the mean of portfolio return.

00:01:43.495 --> 00:01:49.070
This is because alpha factors can help push the portfolio return in a certain direction.

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:52.219
We can think of this as a sail boat on the ocean.

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:54.170
If the boat had sails,

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.930
then the boat could make prudent use of the winds to

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.540
push the boat's average position in a desired direction.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.980
Similarly, if the investor makes effective use of alpha factors,

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.370
they can use those alpha factors to drive

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.814
the mean of the portfolio return in a certain direction,

00:02:10.814 --> 00:02:14.479
ideally in an upward direction.
