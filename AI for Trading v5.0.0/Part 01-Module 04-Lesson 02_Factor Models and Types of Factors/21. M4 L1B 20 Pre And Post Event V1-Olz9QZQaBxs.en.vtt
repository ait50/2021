00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390
Event driven strategies are often combined with

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.509
fundamental and sentiment factors which help us interpret the significance of the event.

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:13.524
For example, companies typically will release their earnings once every three months.

00:00:13.525 --> 00:00:17.399
The dates are scheduled in advance so there are opportunities to

00:00:17.399 --> 00:00:21.765
make trading decisions both before and after the event.

00:00:21.765 --> 00:00:27.449
For pre-event trading, we could use analyst sentiment and fundamentals to

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.448
decide if we expect the earnings release to exceed or fall short of expectations,

00:00:33.448 --> 00:00:36.875
then we can buy or short before the event.

00:00:36.875 --> 00:00:40.320
For example, after analyzing financial statements,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.090
we may think that the news or analyst sentiment is overly

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.430
positive and hypothesize that the actual earnings will be less than what's expected.

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:52.759
So this would be a signal to short or sell.

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:56.585
For post-event trading, we could determine whether

00:00:56.585 --> 00:01:00.795
the actual earnings release was better or worse than expected.

00:01:00.795 --> 00:01:04.545
This is also referred to as an earnings surprise.

00:01:04.545 --> 00:01:08.195
For example, if the actual earnings were above

00:01:08.194 --> 00:01:11.959
what was expected based on analyst's ratings and fundamentals,

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:15.344
then this could potentially be a buy signal.

00:01:15.344 --> 00:01:18.349
We could also combine this with price movements

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:21.259
immediately following the earnings release to

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.750
decide whether other investors considered

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.564
the event to be positive or negative for the stock price.

00:01:27.564 --> 00:01:31.280
In other words, we could treat the price movements immediately following

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.454
an earnings announcement as a measure of investor sentiment towards the stock.

00:01:36.454 --> 00:01:40.825
To summarize, events in combination with price,

00:01:40.825 --> 00:01:45.515
volume, sentiment and fundamentals may inform a strategy.

00:01:45.515 --> 00:01:47.799
One commonly known strategy,

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.250
which doesn't work so well anymore because it is very well known,

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.390
is the post earnings announcement drift.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.409
When firms announced earnings,

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.159
if earnings are above or below expectations,

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.420
they're referred to as earning surprises.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.560
If we assume an efficient market,

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.875
we would expect the market price to adjust

00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:09.299
quickly and stabilize after an earning surprise.

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.640
However, in reality, is often possible that

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:15.759
prices continued drifting in the same direction,

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:18.969
upward for a positive surprise or downward for

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:22.859
negative surprise for about two months after the event.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.020
Even though this factor is well-known and therefore are not

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.925
as likely to be used to see abnormal returns,

00:02:28.925 --> 00:02:31.930
it is instructive to study this phenomenon to get

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.159
some intuition of a market mechanics and behavioral psychology in the markets.
