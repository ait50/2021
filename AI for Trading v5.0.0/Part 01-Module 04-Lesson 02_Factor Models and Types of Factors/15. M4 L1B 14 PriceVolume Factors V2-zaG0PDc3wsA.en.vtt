00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
One of the most commonly used data sources in quant rating is the stock price and volume.

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.900
We will refer to this as price-volume,

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.464
but you may also hear it referred to as technical factors.

00:00:12.464 --> 00:00:15.344
The raw data for price-volume can include

00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:18.445
anything that we learn from a quotes and trade feed.

00:00:18.445 --> 00:00:22.103
For example, adjusted and unadjusted prices,

00:00:22.103 --> 00:00:24.175
the open, high, low,

00:00:24.175 --> 00:00:26.339
close for each time period.

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:29.695
Different time frequencies such as day, week,

00:00:29.695 --> 00:00:33.950
hour, minute, and bid-ask price quotes.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.500
There are operations that we can apply it to

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.159
the price volume data in which we also defined the window length,

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:43.659
which is how many days worth of data to use in the calculation.

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:45.654
We've already seen returns,

00:00:45.655 --> 00:00:48.605
which can be daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly.

00:00:48.604 --> 00:00:53.569
Returns can also be calculated at shorter time scales such as seconds, minutes, hours.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.259
Returns can be calculated from the close of one day to the close of the next day.

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:05.334
Returns can also be calculated on the open price to close price for the same day.

00:01:05.334 --> 00:01:08.194
For example, the open price in the morning

00:01:08.194 --> 00:01:11.809
to the close price of the afternoon on the same day.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.140
Returns can be calculated on the close price of

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.349
one day to the open price of the next day.

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:21.379
For example, the return from the close price of

00:01:21.379 --> 00:01:25.534
Monday evening to the open price of Tuesday morning.

00:01:25.534 --> 00:01:29.049
The last example is referred to as overnight returns,

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.704
and we'll discuss this in detail in a later lesson.

00:01:32.704 --> 00:01:36.620
We can also apply operations on a distribution of returns.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.100
For instance, we can calculate the first four moments,

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:41.794
which are called the mean,

00:01:41.795 --> 00:01:45.359
variance, skew, and kurtosis.

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:49.290
The mean describes the center of the return distribution.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.035
The variance describes the spread of the distribution.

00:01:53.034 --> 00:01:54.784
The square root of variance,

00:01:54.784 --> 00:01:56.534
which is the standard deviation,

00:01:56.534 --> 00:01:59.465
is a common measure of return volatility.

00:01:59.465 --> 00:02:02.915
Skew describes the amount of asymmetry.

00:02:02.915 --> 00:02:05.240
A positive skew, means there are

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:09.284
more extreme values in the positive side of the distribution.

00:02:09.284 --> 00:02:15.680
Kurtosis describes how much of the distribution occurs in the left and right tails.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.890
Stock returns distributions tend to exhibit

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:22.244
larger tails compared to a normal distribution.

00:02:22.245 --> 00:02:26.509
Kurtosis is often referred to as fat tails.

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:30.799
There's also the minimum or maximum over a certain time window.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.235
Note that we'll discuss skewness in a later lesson about alpha factors.

00:02:35.235 --> 00:02:37.630
So, to summarize, pretty much any

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.634
statistical or time series calculation you can think of,

00:02:40.634 --> 00:02:44.804
is fair game for use in a price-volume driven factor.

00:02:44.805 --> 00:02:47.500
Using price and volume as a factor,

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.460
has a benefit of having readily available data,

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.219
since stocks trade on exchanges and many market data vendors sell trades,

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:56.984
quotes, and bar data.

00:02:56.985 --> 00:03:01.720
The availability and regularity of the data source is nice to have,

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:04.090
since other sources for factor generation such

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.789
as fundamentals are updated less frequently,

00:03:06.788 --> 00:03:10.609
and still other data sources such as news, social media,

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.625
or analyst reports may not always be available for the stock that we're analyzing.

00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:19.009
It's very helpful to have a factor that can generate

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:22.514
a signal for every stock in the stock universe.

00:03:22.514 --> 00:03:25.519
This is especially helpful in quant investing,

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.485
since quant investing usually involves portfolios of hundreds or thousands of stocks.

00:03:30.485 --> 00:03:36.180
Keep in mind that the higher frequency of price volume data often leads to more trading,

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.900
and therefore higher portfolio turnover.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.870
Since trading decisions are based on the data,

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.569
the more often the data updates and changes,

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.155
the more often the portfolio is likely to require rebalancing.

00:03:48.155 --> 00:03:52.305
This can be good or bad and requires careful study.

00:03:52.305 --> 00:03:55.510
Faster signals means more information.

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:59.784
More information, all other things being equal, is good.

00:03:59.784 --> 00:04:05.784
However, more rebalancing means more trades and more transaction costs.

00:04:05.784 --> 00:04:07.789
So, strategy that is based on

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:11.810
frequently updated data generally has more transaction costs.

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.449
As a researcher, a key thing you need to

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:18.235
determine is if the higher information content of the signal,

00:04:18.235 --> 00:04:22.600
more than offsets, the likely higher transaction costs.
