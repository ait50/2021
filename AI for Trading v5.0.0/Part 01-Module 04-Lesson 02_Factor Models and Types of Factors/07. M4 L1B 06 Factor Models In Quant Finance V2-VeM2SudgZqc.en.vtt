00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.490
Okay. So, we've learned a little about factor models.

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:05.905
So, how are they used in practice?

00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:07.940
It might not be what you expect.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.975
Most practitioners don't use factor models to explicitly model asset returns.

00:00:12.974 --> 00:00:16.675
Factor modeling has a long history in academic research,

00:00:16.675 --> 00:00:21.565
and some of these methods were used in the past to explicitly model returns time series.

00:00:21.565 --> 00:00:24.510
But when devising and testing trading strategies,

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.690
the models are typically used slightly differently.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.965
We've seen the equations for returns and for risk in terms of factors.

00:00:32.965 --> 00:00:36.020
One key goal is that we want to be able to use

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.655
these expressions in a portfolio optimization problem.

00:00:39.655 --> 00:00:44.935
Now, let me tell you about a couple of simplifications that quants make at this point.

00:00:44.935 --> 00:00:48.120
Let's take the matrix of factor exposures.

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:51.289
As we've said, a value in this matrix represents

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.004
the sensitivity of an individual asset to a specific factor return.

00:00:56.005 --> 00:01:03.255
A portfolio with weights x has a portfolio factor exposure of B transpose x.

00:01:03.255 --> 00:01:06.549
Now, let's introduce a new idea.

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:10.390
Let's say we think there are actually two types of factors.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.079
One type of factor is predictive of the mean of the distribution of returns.

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:20.144
The other type is predictive of the variance of the distribution, but not of the mean.

00:01:20.144 --> 00:01:22.894
The first describes our alpha factors,

00:01:22.894 --> 00:01:25.983
while the second describes our risk factors.

00:01:25.983 --> 00:01:31.179
We'd rather our portfolio be minimally exposed to risk factors.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.945
The drivers of volatility.

00:01:32.944 --> 00:01:36.589
We can try to make this happen by placing constraints on

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.245
B transpose x that only apply to factors that we think are drivers of volatility.

00:01:42.245 --> 00:01:46.990
We do this typically in the constraints section of the optimization problem.

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:52.669
This will specifically reduce the exposure of our portfolio to these risk factors.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.415
However, we don't constrain the factors that are drivers of mean returns.

00:01:57.415 --> 00:01:59.515
So, we drop them from B.

00:01:59.515 --> 00:02:05.159
Hence, you can think of B now as the risk factor loading matrix only.

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.299
The alpha factors aren't kept in here because we're not

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.180
going to constrain them the way we do with the risk factors.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.969
What about F and S. We think about F as

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:20.164
the covariance matrix of factor returns that have

00:02:20.164 --> 00:02:23.620
large impact on variance across all stocks,

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.805
and S as the variance that's left over.

00:02:26.805 --> 00:02:30.665
In fact, we define risk factors precisely as

00:02:30.664 --> 00:02:35.189
factors that have large impact on variance across all stocks.

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:41.344
So, we include only the risk factors in F. Anything that's left over,

00:02:41.344 --> 00:02:46.199
like variance from the alpha factors we took out and everything we can't explain,

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:54.429
is accounted for in S. We can use F and S together to constrain portfolio risk.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.599
The key takeaway here though is that, in practice,

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:03.454
B and F explicitly contain only information about risk factors.

00:03:03.455 --> 00:03:07.110
S says nothing explicitly about alpha.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.910
Practitioners will usually buy F, S,

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:13.085
and B from a commercial provider,

00:03:13.085 --> 00:03:15.530
and now we can see why that is sufficient.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.655
We typically don't mix our alphas and risk factors.

00:03:19.655 --> 00:03:23.675
What about the alpha factors we took out from B?

00:03:23.675 --> 00:03:29.735
We are left with some number of alpha factors which are values per stock per factor.

00:03:29.735 --> 00:03:31.540
What do we do with those?

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:36.129
This is where the creation of the objective function and optimization comes in.

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:39.129
We need to combine these into a single vector,

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:41.104
which we will do in later projects,

00:03:41.104 --> 00:03:44.669
and optimize our resulting weight to these.
