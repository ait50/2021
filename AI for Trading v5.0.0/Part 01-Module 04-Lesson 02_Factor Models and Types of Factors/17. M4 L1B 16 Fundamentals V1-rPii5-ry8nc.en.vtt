00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.129
The other commonly used data in factor construction are called fundamentals.

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:10.140
These are measures derived from financial statements such as price to earnings ratios.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.450
Price volume factors and

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:16.469
fundamental factors are the most commonly used factors for quant trading,

00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:19.349
and it's possible for some active fund managers to

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.695
rely primarily on these two types of factors.

00:00:22.695 --> 00:00:27.719
A practical difference with fundamental factors compared to technical factors is that

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:33.219
financial statement data is usually updated on a quarterly basis, not daily.

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:37.134
This means that if a fund is trading at a daily frequency,

00:00:37.134 --> 00:00:39.890
they use the most recent fundamental data for

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.560
the three months until it's refreshed in the next quarter.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.270
Fundamental factors allow for higher capacity,

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.920
which means that one can potentially put more capital on that particular trade.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.749
This is in part due to lower turnover,

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:57.289
as we would only update our portfolio when

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.409
new financial statements arrive every three months.

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.459
Lower turnover generally means lower transaction costs,

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:09.494
which means we can put more capital behind a strategy based on fundamental factors.

00:01:09.495 --> 00:01:12.890
One factor you've seen before is the market cap,

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.430
which is a measure of the size of a company.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.825
Generally, small cap companies have historically outperformed large cap companies.

00:01:20.825 --> 00:01:23.210
So strategy may involve overweighting

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:27.239
small cap stocks and underweighting large cap stocks.
