00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.805
Okay. So, we've talked about factors in the

00:00:02.805 --> 00:00:06.070
abstract and in your head you're thinking, "Okay,

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.179
it's a vector where the values for each stock are

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.359
proportional to some aspect of the future performance of that stock."

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:15.019
Yes, you're right.

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:16.570
When I first learned this,

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.219
in some ways, it wasn't very satisfying to me.

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:22.515
But there's a sense in which that's what you need to know.

00:00:22.515 --> 00:00:25.830
But I want to give you more because there is more to

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.759
the story but that's where it gets more complicated.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.290
So stay with me and I promise it will pay

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.399
dividends in your learning for the next several lessons.

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.714
There is a formalism behind factors,

00:00:36.715 --> 00:00:38.580
let me tell you a little about it.

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.969
There's such a thing in the statistical literature called a factor model.

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:46.009
A factor model is a statistical model used to

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:49.739
describe variability among observed correlated variables,

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.615
in terms of potentially smaller number of unobserved variables called factors.

00:00:54.615 --> 00:00:59.115
This method is actually used in several disciplines including biology,

00:00:59.115 --> 00:01:02.285
psychology, and business, as well as finance.

00:01:02.284 --> 00:01:05.899
Whenever practitioners are looking to discover a smaller number of

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.215
so-called latent variables that explain correlations in a set of variables of interest.

00:01:12.215 --> 00:01:16.325
We could apply this type of analysis to many situations,

00:01:16.325 --> 00:01:21.765
but in finance, we're typically interested in modelling the returns of several assets.

00:01:21.765 --> 00:01:26.825
We might notice that the returns of some assets seem to vary together.

00:01:26.825 --> 00:01:30.290
Are these companies similar in some way such that some

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.340
underlying effect influences both of them in the same way?

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.540
What if we could model the returns of a large group of stocks with

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.575
a smaller set of variables which explain their common variability?

00:01:42.575 --> 00:01:45.510
This is what we attempt to do with factor models.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.775
The observed variables, in our case returns,

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:55.315
are modeled as linear combinations of the factors returns plus error terms.

00:01:55.314 --> 00:01:59.480
So a generic linear factor model looks something like

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.475
this: we model the return on a stock,

00:02:03.474 --> 00:02:06.609
bond mutual fund or something else as

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:11.245
a linear function of returns attributed to several factors.

00:02:11.245 --> 00:02:16.120
The values of these factor returns are the same for all stocks.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.180
The factor exposures tell you how much the return of

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.050
an individual asset should change per unit change in a factor return.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.165
Here, the last term, the error term,

00:02:29.164 --> 00:02:34.789
is the portion of the return on asset not related to any of the factors.

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:38.784
In words, the return of any stock, i,

00:02:38.784 --> 00:02:41.185
can be decomposed into the returns of

00:02:41.185 --> 00:02:44.995
factors times the stock's exposures to those factors,

00:02:44.995 --> 00:02:47.730
plus an unexplained portion.
