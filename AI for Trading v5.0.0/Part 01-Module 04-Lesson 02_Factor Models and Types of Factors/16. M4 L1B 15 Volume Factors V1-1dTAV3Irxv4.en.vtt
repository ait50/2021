00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
Volume-based factors usually include price information,

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.609
to categorize the volume in a given time period as a net buy or net sell.

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:13.230
At first glance, the idea of net buying or net selling,

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.690
may appear counterintuitive when you recall,

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:18.585
that every transaction involves a buyer and a seller.

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:22.135
Some examples will help to clarify what we mean by this.

00:00:22.135 --> 00:00:24.390
A volume factor may track whether

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.469
the total trading volume of a stock is higher than normal,

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:33.844
and use that to determine whether recent price movements are significant or not.

00:00:33.844 --> 00:00:39.564
For example, sometimes stock exchanges are open on or around a major holiday,

00:00:39.564 --> 00:00:43.070
and since fewer investors are participating in trading,

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.744
volume may be lower on these days.

00:00:45.744 --> 00:00:49.564
So investors will take the low volume into consideration,

00:00:49.564 --> 00:00:53.719
when deciding whether price movements are significant or not.

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.094
Volume can help add more context to a price-based factor,

00:00:58.094 --> 00:01:00.024
such as a moment factor.

00:01:00.024 --> 00:01:04.909
For instance, unusually high volumes that accompanies a major price movement,

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.594
may be a sign that the momentum signal is more significant than usual.

00:01:09.594 --> 00:01:13.034
One could say that the price-based momentum factor,

00:01:13.034 --> 00:01:16.799
is conditioned on the volume information.

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.384
One piece of volume data that is independent of price is called short interest.

00:01:22.385 --> 00:01:26.365
Short interest tracks the quantity of a stock shares,

00:01:26.364 --> 00:01:28.399
which are held short.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.620
When a trader shorts a stock,

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.500
they borrow the stock from its owner and sell it,

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.444
with a hope of buying the stock back at a later date when it's cheaper.

00:01:37.444 --> 00:01:41.209
If instead, the stock price increases,

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:44.974
the short seller will realize mark to market losses.

00:01:44.974 --> 00:01:47.899
Mark to market is an accounting concept,

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.740
that assess the value of a health asset at its market price.

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:53.750
So mark to market losses,

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.129
are unrealized losses that are tracked in accounting,

00:01:57.129 --> 00:02:01.369
even if the asset isn't sold to realize those losses.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.120
This can become expensive if the stock price keeps rising,

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.785
so short-sellers may decide to cut their losses,

00:02:07.784 --> 00:02:09.865
by buying the stock at the market price,

00:02:09.865 --> 00:02:11.885
and closing out their position.

00:02:11.884 --> 00:02:14.914
This is called a short squeeze.

00:02:14.914 --> 00:02:16.959
If this sounds a bit complicated,

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.925
consider the mirror image of a short squeeze,

00:02:19.925 --> 00:02:22.060
which is a long squeeze.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.724
If you bought stock in a retail company,

00:02:24.724 --> 00:02:27.739
and watch the stock price decline day after day,

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.045
you might have decided at some point to cut your losses and sell the stock.

00:02:32.044 --> 00:02:36.079
This long squeeze is the mirror image of a short squeeze.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.460
When a short squeeze occurs due to an upward price movement,

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.770
the additional stock buying that it triggers,

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.415
tends to add more upward momentum to the stock price.

00:02:46.414 --> 00:02:49.929
So if recent short interests is higher than usual,

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.310
this might be considered a buy signal.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.050
Since an increase in price,

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.010
may trigger a domino effect of additional increases.

00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:01.024
This could motivate a nice Alpha factor.

00:03:01.025 --> 00:03:04.430
Find stocks that have high price momentum,

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.575
and are highly shorted.

00:03:06.574 --> 00:03:11.359
In this case, short interest data could act as a conditioning information,

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.360
to make a momentum signal stronger.
