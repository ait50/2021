00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.035
Index adds can drive buying of the stock that was added to a major index,

00:00:05.035 --> 00:00:10.140
while index deletions can drive selling of that stock. So, why is that?

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.394
You'll recall, that an index is not a fund.

00:00:13.394 --> 00:00:17.554
So, what causes this buying and selling when an index changes?

00:00:17.554 --> 00:00:19.949
Recall that funds and ETFs,

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.269
particularly passive funds that track a major index,

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:26.894
want to create portfolios that match that index.

00:00:26.894 --> 00:00:31.829
So any changes in the index requires a change in the funds portfolio.

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:37.189
Even Spark Beta or actively managed funds may consider adjusting their portfolios after

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:39.759
an index add or deletion is announced since

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:42.750
they may use that particular index as their benchmark,

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.369
and the stock universe for the portfolio may depend upon what's in the benchmark.

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:52.709
For example, when Monsanto was acquired in June of 2018,

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.524
the S&amp;P 500 removed Monsanto and added Twitter.

00:00:57.524 --> 00:01:02.869
Twitter's stock increased by about five percent after the announcement as funds and

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:08.834
ETFs that track the S&amp;P 500 bought Twitter's stock in order to match the index.

00:01:08.834 --> 00:01:13.639
We could follow the news for index adds and buy the stock anticipating that

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.400
other funds who need to buy that stock will add

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.535
momentum to the price increase in the short term.

00:01:19.534 --> 00:01:23.780
Similarly, index deletions could be a signal to sell or share

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.060
the stock since funds will also sell

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.125
their holdings to match the index that they're tracking.

00:01:29.125 --> 00:01:34.069
As always, you need to use care and judgment here as it is likely that

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:40.479
this information is very well known and therefore might not be a strong Alpha factor.
