00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.509
Analysts factors are derived from the published reports

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:07.035
of sell-side research analysts at investment banks.

00:00:07.035 --> 00:00:11.699
Their reports include ratings such as buy, hold, or sell.

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:16.254
They also include earnings estimates or price targets for the stock.

00:00:16.254 --> 00:00:21.660
Sell-side analysts may be assigned to a few companies within the same industry,

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.615
and may even meet with the management of the companies that they evaluate.

00:00:25.614 --> 00:00:28.049
This research is intended for

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.625
buy-side investment firms such as mutual funds and hedge funds,

00:00:31.625 --> 00:00:35.204
who execute their trades with these sell-side investment banks.

00:00:35.204 --> 00:00:40.009
Since many large investment firms value the opinions or research analysts,

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:44.599
their published analysis can have significant effects on stock trading.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.960
If you read financial news and the news mentioned that

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.320
a particular stock has a buy or hold rating,

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.698
this is likely an average rating of multiple research analysts.

00:00:55.698 --> 00:01:00.259
We may also refer to analyst ratings as a kind of sentiment factor

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:02.359
because each research analysts

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:05.469
aggregates their information about the company's financials,

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:08.840
it's growth prospects as well as its current price,

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.510
and then summarizes this into the analysts overall

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.605
conclusion or sentiment about that stock.

00:01:15.605 --> 00:01:18.995
Investment banks choose their own rating scale.

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:24.295
For example, one has buy, neutral, or sell.

00:01:24.295 --> 00:01:27.859
Another has overweight, equal weight,

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:31.114
underweight, or more volatile.

00:01:31.114 --> 00:01:35.759
Yet another has trading by, recommended list,

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.400
market out performer, market performer and market underperformer.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.600
Sell-side ratings are usually aggregated to

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:47.934
create a consensus sentiment about a particular stock.

00:01:47.935 --> 00:01:52.519
It's also useful to focus on when analysts change their ratings.

00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:55.489
For example, if multiple analysts start

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:58.489
changing their ratings of a stock from hold to sell,

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:03.824
we might expect investors who follow analyst ratings to start selling that stock.

00:02:03.825 --> 00:02:07.980
Analyst ratings may experience a heard mentality.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.909
It's difficult for a single analyst to publish a sell rating

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:16.349
when most other analysts in the industry are publishing a buy rating.

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.530
In other words, it's safer to be wrong when everyone else is also wrong,

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.599
but more costly for an analyst to be wrong when everyone else is right.

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:30.344
So instead of taking a simple average of analyst ratings,

00:02:30.344 --> 00:02:31.969
it may be useful to focus on

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:37.389
the most reputable star analysts and give their ratings more weight.

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:42.274
One way to combine analyst sentiment into a trading signal is to aggregate

00:02:42.275 --> 00:02:47.055
all the ratings that have changed over a certain period such as the past three months.

00:02:47.055 --> 00:02:52.515
If we count all the ratings upgrades and subtract all the ratings downgrades,

00:02:52.514 --> 00:02:56.884
then we have a number that is either positive, negative or 0.

00:02:56.884 --> 00:03:00.185
A positive number represents a positive sentiment,

00:03:00.185 --> 00:03:03.289
whereas a negative number is a negative sentiment.

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:06.590
To rescale this sentiment between negative 1 and 1,

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.539
we could divide this number by the total number of analysts that we're tracking,

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:14.599
whether they upgraded, downgraded or cut their rating the same.
