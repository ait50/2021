00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
Advanced natural language processing techniques are

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.359
being used to enhance fundamental analysis.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.720
Fundamental analysis is the kind of work done by

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.575
traditional investment analysts who work for financial institutions,

00:00:13.574 --> 00:00:16.140
like mutual funds and brokerage firms.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:21.519
Much of the text-based analysis that fundamental researchers perform on companies,

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:24.019
whether it's reading financial news,

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:26.239
reading quarterly earnings reports,

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:28.289
listening to earnings calls,

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.899
or reading forms submitted to regulatory agencies,

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:36.104
this work can be enhanced with natural language processing.

00:00:36.104 --> 00:00:41.454
For example, a human analyst usually tracks 10 to 20 companies.

00:00:41.454 --> 00:00:44.679
Computers could act as a first-pass filter

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:48.274
sifting through the same data source for thousands of companies.

00:00:48.274 --> 00:00:50.710
The automated methods could filter,

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.480
categorize, and label the information.

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:57.679
This could help fundamental analysts decide which companies or

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:01.979
information sources to prioritize for further analysis.

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:06.200
So, the pre-processing performed with NLP could support and

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.999
enhance the existing workflow of fundamental research analysts.

00:01:10.998 --> 00:01:13.549
One can also look for insights in

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.560
the required paperwork that companies send to government regulators.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.250
In the United States,

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.150
the Securities Exchange Commission or SEC receives

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.975
10-K forms from companies once a year and three 10-Q forms per year.

00:01:28.974 --> 00:01:32.464
The 10-K details the companies view of its business,

00:01:32.465 --> 00:01:34.755
its past financial results for the year,

00:01:34.754 --> 00:01:38.789
as well as its current or potential future business risks.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.235
One potential use of these 10-Ks is to track how a company's business evolves over time.

00:01:45.234 --> 00:01:49.534
For instance, one study used natural language processing to analyze

00:01:49.534 --> 00:01:54.364
Amazon's 10-Ks from the years 2007 to 2016.

00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:57.905
The researchers attempted to determine which sectors

00:01:57.905 --> 00:02:02.144
the company most closely resembled based on its 10-K reports.

00:02:02.144 --> 00:02:05.329
In 2007, the company's description of

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.664
its business most resembled the software and hardware sectors.

00:02:09.664 --> 00:02:14.840
Over time, the company's description based on it's 10-K forms resembled more

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.360
of the retail and software sector and to some extent the media sector.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.275
You may be wondering how we could make use of this information.

00:02:24.275 --> 00:02:27.784
The sector that companies closely resemble are

00:02:27.784 --> 00:02:31.919
factors that help explain the price movement of their stocks.

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:36.500
You could imagine that retail stocks may be correlated to some extent,

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.664
and technology companies may also exhibit similar price movements.

00:02:40.664 --> 00:02:42.280
In a later lesson,

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.055
we'll learn how the sector is a particularly important factor

00:02:46.055 --> 00:02:50.974
and we'll learn about adjusting a portfolio to be sector neutral.

00:02:50.974 --> 00:02:57.299
Another application of natural language processing on 10-K forms is sentiment analysis.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.135
You may be familiar with sentiment analysis on movie reviews or restaurant reviews,

00:03:03.134 --> 00:03:09.250
usually to categorize user-generated text as positive, neutral, or negative.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.680
Sentiment analysis can be used with other categories as well.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.165
For instance, one could apply sentiment analysis

00:03:17.164 --> 00:03:20.639
to estimate how much little risk a company's 10-K

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:23.869
describes or how much uncertainty

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.805
the company faces from competitors, customers, or suppliers.

00:03:28.805 --> 00:03:32.944
One could imagine creating factors based on positive outlook,

00:03:32.944 --> 00:03:35.604
negative outlook, little risk,

00:03:35.604 --> 00:03:39.375
business uncertainty, or any number of categories.

00:03:39.375 --> 00:03:43.560
These labels could also be used to create Alpha factors.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.925
In fact, you will be applying natural language processing

00:03:46.925 --> 00:03:50.344
on corporate documents in term two of this program.

00:03:50.344 --> 00:03:52.699
For now, we want to first build-up

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:57.844
a comfortable foundation in factor risk modeling and Alpha factor research.

00:03:57.844 --> 00:04:00.859
This will give you the context to understand where

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.280
NLP and deep learning techniques can fit into the quad workflow.
