00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.355
Now that we've discussed how to build a histogram,

00:00:03.355 --> 00:00:07.550
we can use this to determine the shape associated with our data.

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:09.875
Here we have three histograms,

00:00:09.875 --> 00:00:13.300
showing the shape for three different data sets.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.675
The histogram that has shorter bins on the left and taller bins on the right,

00:00:17.675 --> 00:00:20.420
is considered a left skewed shape.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.530
This histogram that has shorter bins on the right and taller bins on the left,

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.859
is considered a right skewed shape.

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.669
Any distribution where you can draw a line down the middle and

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.289
the right side mirrors the left side is considered symmetric.

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:38.100
One of the most common symmetric distributions,

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.765
is known as a normal distribution and it's also called the Bell Curve.

00:00:42.765 --> 00:00:46.109
The shape of the distribution can actually tell us

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:49.628
a lot about the measures of center and spread.

00:00:49.628 --> 00:00:54.829
Symmetric distributions, like this one have a mean that's equal to the median,

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.359
which also equals the mode.

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:00.719
Each of these measures sits here in the center.

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.194
The mode is essentially the tallest bar in our histogram.

00:01:05.194 --> 00:01:07.729
When we have skewed distributions,

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.140
it's the case of the mean is pulled by the tail of the distribution,

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.579
while the median stays closer to the mode.

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:16.685
For example, in this right skewed distribution,

00:01:16.685 --> 00:01:18.439
the mean would be pulled higher,

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.575
resulting in a mean that's greater than our median.

00:01:21.575 --> 00:01:24.962
Alternatively, in a left skewed distribution,

00:01:24.962 --> 00:01:26.719
our mean is pulled down here,

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:30.454
resulting in a mean that's less than our median.

00:01:30.454 --> 00:01:33.674
In order to relate this to the visual of a histogram,

00:01:33.674 --> 00:01:37.379
back to the five number summary we saw on the earlier lessons,

00:01:37.379 --> 00:01:42.060
here are the corresponding box plots below each histogram.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.240
Notice how the whiskers stretch in the direction of the skew,

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:47.489
for each of the skewed distributions.

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:50.354
That is the longer whisker is on the left,

00:01:50.355 --> 00:01:53.070
for a left skewed distribution and it's on the right,

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:55.099
for the right skewed distribution.

00:01:55.099 --> 00:02:01.000
Alternatively, the symmetric histogram also has a symmetric box spot.
