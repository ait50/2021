00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.544
Looking back at the distributions we found for the number of dogs I see,

00:00:04.544 --> 00:00:09.390
we can mark the values of our five number summary like this.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.714
If we take just these marks,

00:00:11.714 --> 00:00:16.125
this makes a common plot for data known as a box plot.

00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:19.179
Though I prefer a histogram in most cases,

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:22.170
a box plot can be useful for quickly

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.415
comparing the spread of two data sets across some key metrics,

00:00:26.414 --> 00:00:29.684
like our quartiles, and the maximum and minimum.

00:00:29.684 --> 00:00:33.659
From both the histogram and the five-number summary,

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:36.599
we can quickly see that the number of dogs I see on

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.085
weekends varies much more than the number of dogs I see on weekdays.

00:00:42.085 --> 00:00:47.564
We can also visualize the distance from here to here as the range,

00:00:47.564 --> 00:00:52.099
while the distance from here to here is the interquartile range.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.160
There are lots of useful metrics we can get from these box plots.

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:00.750
But what if we want to compare the spreads of these distributions without having to carry

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.159
around all five of these values for each distribution?

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.000
What if I wanted just a single value to be able to compare the two distributions spreads?
