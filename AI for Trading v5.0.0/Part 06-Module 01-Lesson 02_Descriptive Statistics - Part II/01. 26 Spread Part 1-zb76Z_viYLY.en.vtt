00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
That last section was intense.

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.740
I hope the quizzes reinforce what was shown in the videos.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.054
I know the first time I saw a notation,

00:00:10.054 --> 00:00:12.459
it totally went over my head.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.880
We will begin this lesson looking at

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.815
the second aspect with regard to analyzing quantitative variables, the spread.

00:00:20.815 --> 00:00:23.210
When we discussed measures of spread,

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.960
we are considering numeric values that are

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.015
associated with how far points are from one another.

00:00:30.015 --> 00:00:33.554
Common values of spread include the range,

00:00:33.554 --> 00:00:38.009
the inter-quartile range, the standard deviation, and the variance.
