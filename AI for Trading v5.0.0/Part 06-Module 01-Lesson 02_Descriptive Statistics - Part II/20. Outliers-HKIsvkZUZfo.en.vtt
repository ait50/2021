00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.955
In this video, we want to look at the final aspect

00:00:03.955 --> 00:00:08.344
used to describe quantitative variables, Outliers.

00:00:08.345 --> 00:00:13.804
Outliers are data points that fall very far from the rest of the values in our data set.

00:00:13.804 --> 00:00:17.550
In order to determine what is very far,

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.714
there are a number of different methods.

00:00:19.714 --> 00:00:24.179
My usual method for detecting outliers isn't very scientific.

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.420
Usually, I just look at a histogram and see if

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.665
the point is really far from any of the other data points.

00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:34.469
Again, a quick plot of your data can

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.159
often help you understand a lot in a short amount of time.

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:41.459
In order to illustrate the impact that outliers can

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.000
have on the way we report summary statistics,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.085
let's consider the salaries of entrepreneurs.

00:00:48.085 --> 00:00:51.719
Imagine I select ten entrepreneur earnings and I

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.615
pull these nine values here as earnings in thousands of dollars,

00:00:55.615 --> 00:00:58.950
and the tenth is the CEO of Facebook.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.984
According to a post by CNN in 2016,

00:01:02.984 --> 00:01:09.409
he earned 4.4 million dollars per day.

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.099
Here, we can calculate the mean of these salaries for

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:19.434
entrepreneurs based on this data to be approximately 160 million dollars.

00:01:19.435 --> 00:01:21.590
This is incredibly misleading.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.760
Literally zero of the entrepreneurs earned this salary.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.719
None of the ten salaries are even close to this amount.

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:32.905
A better measure of center would certainly be the median.

00:01:32.905 --> 00:01:37.370
The median here is calculated at 62,000 dollars a year and is

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:43.070
a better indication of what an entrepreneur is likely to earn based on our data.

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:46.894
Our standard deviation is also not a great measure in this case.

00:01:46.894 --> 00:01:50.379
At approximately 482 million dollars,

00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:55.454
all this suggests is that our earnings for entrepreneurs are really spread out,

00:01:55.454 --> 00:01:57.914
but that really isn't fair either.

00:01:57.915 --> 00:02:01.675
Just one point is really far from the rest.

00:02:01.674 --> 00:02:04.000
Like really really far.
