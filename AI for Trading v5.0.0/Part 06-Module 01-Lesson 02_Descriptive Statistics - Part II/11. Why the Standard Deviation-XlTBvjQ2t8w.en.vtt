00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.275
So it might seem absurd to do this calculation of the standard deviation.

00:00:05.275 --> 00:00:08.419
I mean, it's such a complicated way to measure the spread

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:11.984
of our data compared to the five number summary we saw earlier.

00:00:11.984 --> 00:00:16.250
But it turns out that the standard deviation is used all the

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.140
time to get a single number to compare the spread of two data sets.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.339
It is kind of nice to be able to talk about how spread out our data are from one

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:30.000
another without having to report an entire table of values.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.240
We can just compare the standard deviation for

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.315
one group to the standard deviation of another group.

00:00:35.314 --> 00:00:39.149
And we have a way to tell which dataset is more spread out.

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.379
Having one number simplifies the amount of

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.230
information that the person you're reporting to needs to consume.

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:48.544
Having the single value also has

00:00:48.545 --> 00:00:52.844
other advantages with regard to what is known as inferential statistics,

00:00:52.844 --> 00:00:55.054
but that's beyond what we need to know now.

00:00:55.054 --> 00:00:59.210
For now, we just need to know that we have a way to take all of

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.579
our values and get a single number

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.280
that tells us how spread out they are from one another.
