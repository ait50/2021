00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.409
In the last video,

00:00:01.409 --> 00:00:05.600
we got an idea of what the standard deviation is measuring.

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:07.709
In this video, we will look at

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.849
the math that actually occurs when calculating this measure.

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.259
We will work with data to calculate this measure as well as associate notation with it.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.060
It is worth noting that after this lesson,

00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:25.064
you probably won't calculate this measure by hand ever again,

00:00:25.065 --> 00:00:27.765
because you'll learn software to do it for you.

00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:34.049
The calculating it yourself will give you intuition behind what it's actually doing.

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:37.449
And this intuition is necessary to become good at

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.565
understanding data and choosing the right analysis for your situation.

00:00:42.564 --> 00:00:45.614
Imagine we have a data set with four values,

00:00:45.615 --> 00:00:49.605
10, 14, 10, and 6.

00:00:49.604 --> 00:00:55.219
The first thing we need to do to calculate the standard deviation is to find the mean.

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.850
In notation, we have this as X bar.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.700
For our values, the sum is 40,

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.010
and we have four numbers.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.115
So the mean is 40 over 4 or 10.

00:01:09.114 --> 00:01:14.169
Then we want to look at the distance of each observation from this mean.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.515
Two of these observations are exactly equal to the mean.

00:01:18.515 --> 00:01:21.204
So the distance here is zero.

00:01:21.204 --> 00:01:24.149
One is 4 larger the 14,

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.880
while the other is 4 smaller the 6.

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:34.539
In notation, each of these is XI minus X bar.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.995
Then, if we were to average these distances,

00:01:37.995 --> 00:01:41.219
the positive would cancel with the negative value.

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:45.525
And the value of zero isn't a great measure of the spread here.

00:01:45.525 --> 00:01:52.050
Zero would suggest that all the values are the same or that there's no spread.

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.604
So instead, we need to make all of these values positive.

00:01:56.605 --> 00:02:02.460
The way we do this when calculating the standard deviation is by squaring them all.

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:03.759
If we do that here,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.420
our negative and positive 4 values will become 16s.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:13.405
Now, we could average these to find the average

00:02:13.405 --> 00:02:18.250
squared distance of each observation from the mean.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.810
This is called the variance.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.430
Finding the average, just as we did before,

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.064
means adding all of these values and dividing by how many there are.

00:02:29.064 --> 00:02:33.115
In our case, we had 0, 16,

00:02:33.115 --> 00:02:38.800
0, 16 and we divide by 4 because we have four observations.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.740
However, this is an average of

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:48.040
squared values which we only did to get positive values in the first place.

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:49.870
So to get our standard deviation,

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.087
we take the square root of this ending value.

00:02:53.087 --> 00:02:57.930
Here, our standard deviation is 2.83.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.280
So this is on average how far each point in our data set is from the mean,

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.000
which is the definition of the standard deviation.
