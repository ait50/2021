00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.559
A few quick final points to keep in mind about the standard deviation.

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:08.969
First, the standard deviation is frequently used to compare

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.589
the spread of different groups to determine which is more spread out.

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:18.295
Second, when data pertains to money or the economy,

00:00:18.295 --> 00:00:22.625
having higher standard deviation is associated with having higher risk.

00:00:22.625 --> 00:00:24.609
In comparing stock prices,

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:29.379
a stock price that changes with higher standard deviation over time is considered more

00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:35.219
risky than a stock price that fluctuates with lower standard deviation.

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.229
Third, for a comparison to be fair,

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:40.329
all data must be in the same units.

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:42.945
If you're measuring in dollars for one data set,

00:00:42.945 --> 00:00:44.674
but euros for another,

00:00:44.674 --> 00:00:49.519
it's not fair to compare these data sets to determine which has the greatest spread.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.120
Finally, the variance has squared units of your original measurements.

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:58.949
For example, if you were measuring revenue in dollars,

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.040
the variance has units of dollars squared,

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.469
which isn't particularly useful.

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:07.409
For this reason, the standard deviation,

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.509
which is the square root of the variance,

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.329
is often deemed a more useful measurement of

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:16.655
spread as it shares the units of the original data set.

00:01:16.655 --> 00:01:19.055
If you measure revenue in dollars,

00:01:19.055 --> 00:01:23.000
the standard deviation also has units of dollars.
