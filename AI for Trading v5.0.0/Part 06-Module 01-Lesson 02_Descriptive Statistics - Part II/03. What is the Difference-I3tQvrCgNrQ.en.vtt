00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
Here, are two histograms comparing the number of dogs that I

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.835
saw on weekdays to the number of dogs I saw on weekends from last year.

00:00:08.835 --> 00:00:11.730
You will notice that the tallest bins for

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.670
both weekdays and weekends are associated with 13 dogs.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.140
So the number of dogs I expect to see are

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.755
essentially the same for weekdays as on weekends.

00:00:22.754 --> 00:00:26.445
And the measures of center would basically be the same here.

00:00:26.445 --> 00:00:28.530
Both have a mean, median,

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.575
and mode that are about 13 dogs.

00:00:31.574 --> 00:00:35.335
But something is different about these two distributions.

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:37.380
So what's the difference?

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.790
Well, the difference is how spread out the data are for each group.

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:48.700
You can see that the number of dogs I see on weekdays, ranges from 10-16.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.830
While on weekends, it ranges from 6-18.

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.780
In the upcoming sections,

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.070
we will look at the most common ways to measure the spread of our data.
