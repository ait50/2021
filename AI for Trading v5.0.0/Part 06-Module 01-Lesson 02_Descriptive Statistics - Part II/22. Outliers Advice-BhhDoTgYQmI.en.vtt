00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.974
If you're the one doing the reporting,

00:00:02.975 --> 00:00:06.544
here are some of my personal guidelines when analyzing data.

00:00:06.544 --> 00:00:09.625
First, plot your data.

00:00:09.625 --> 00:00:12.154
Second, if you have outliers,

00:00:12.154 --> 00:00:14.209
determine how you should handle them.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.650
This might require a domain expert of the field.

00:00:17.649 --> 00:00:18.919
Should you remove them?

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.760
Should you fix them? Should you keep them?

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.984
Third, if you're working with data that are normally distributed,

00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:28.050
the bell shape that we saw before,

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.920
you can find out every little detail about

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.314
the data with only the mean and the standard deviation.

00:00:35.314 --> 00:00:38.479
This may seem surprising but it's true.

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:41.524
However, if our data are skewed,

00:00:41.524 --> 00:00:45.019
the five-number summary provides much more information for

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.345
these data sets than the mean and the standard deviation can provide.

00:00:49.344 --> 00:00:56.420
Again, the most useful and informative summary you can get is frequently a visual.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.060
In upcoming lessons, we will focus

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.000
specifically on the visuals that will best convey our message.
