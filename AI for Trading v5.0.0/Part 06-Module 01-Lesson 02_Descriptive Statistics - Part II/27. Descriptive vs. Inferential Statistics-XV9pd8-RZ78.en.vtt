00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.565
The topics covered this far have all been aimed at descriptive statistics.

00:00:06.565 --> 00:00:09.949
That is, describing the data we've collected.

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:13.029
There's an entire other field of statistics

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:16.149
known as inferential statistics that's aimed at drawing

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:19.104
conclusions about a population of individuals

00:00:19.105 --> 00:00:23.375
based only on a sample of individuals from that population.

00:00:23.375 --> 00:00:30.199
Imagine I want to understand what proportion of all Udacity students drink coffee.

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:31.504
We know you're busy,

00:00:31.504 --> 00:00:33.570
and in order to get projects in on time,

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.289
we assume you almost drink a ton of coffee.

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:40.469
I send out an email to all Udacity alumni and

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.295
current students asking the question, do you drink coffee?

00:00:44.295 --> 00:00:46.510
For purposes of this exercise,

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:50.640
let's say the list contained 100,000 emails.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.445
Unfortunately, not everyone responds to my email blast.

00:00:54.445 --> 00:00:57.060
Some of the emails don't even go through.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.900
Therefore, I only receive 5,000 responses.

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.834
I find that 73% of the individuals that responded to my email blast,

00:01:05.834 --> 00:01:08.424
say they do drink coffee.

00:01:08.424 --> 00:01:13.049
Descriptive statistics is about describing the data we have.

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:20.765
That is, any information we have and share regarding the 5,000 responses is descriptive.

00:01:20.765 --> 00:01:24.469
Inferential statistics is about drawing conclusions

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:28.655
regarding the coffee drinking habits of all Udacity students,

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:32.734
only using the data from the 5,000 responses.

00:01:32.734 --> 00:01:38.120
Therefore, inferential statistics in our example is all about drawing conclusions

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:45.620
regarding all 100,000 Udacity students using only the 5,000 responses from our sample.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.564
The general language associated with this scenario is as shown here.

00:01:50.564 --> 00:01:54.394
We have a population which is our entire group of interest.

00:01:54.394 --> 00:01:57.334
In our case, the 100,000 students.

00:01:57.334 --> 00:02:01.859
We collect a subset from this population which we call a sample.

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:05.109
In our case, the 5,000 students.

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:10.590
Any numeric summary calculated from the sample is called a statistic.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.485
In our case, the 73% of the 5,000 that drink coffee.

00:02:15.485 --> 00:02:18.935
This 73% is the statistic.

00:02:18.935 --> 00:02:23.474
A numeric summary of the population is known as a parameter.

00:02:23.474 --> 00:02:27.049
In our case, we don't know this value as it's

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.495
a number that requires information from all Udacity students.

00:02:31.495 --> 00:02:38.110
Drawing conclusions regarding a parameter based on our statistics is known as inference.
