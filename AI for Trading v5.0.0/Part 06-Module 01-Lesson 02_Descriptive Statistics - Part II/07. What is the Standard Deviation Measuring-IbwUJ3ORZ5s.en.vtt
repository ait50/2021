00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.833
The most common way that professionals measure the spread of a data

00:00:04.833 --> 00:00:09.779
set with a single value is with the standard deviation or variance.

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:13.064
Here, we will focus on the standard deviation,

00:00:13.064 --> 00:00:17.994
but we will actually learn how to calculate the variance in the process.

00:00:17.995 --> 00:00:20.535
If you have never heard of these measures before,

00:00:20.535 --> 00:00:23.940
this calculation will probably look pretty complex.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.670
When all's said and done with this calculation,

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.375
the standard deviation will tell us on average

00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:35.155
how far every point is from the mean of the points.

00:00:35.155 --> 00:00:37.000
As a quick mental picture,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.019
imagine we wanted to know how far employees were located from their place of work.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.090
One person might be 15 miles,

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.170
another 35, another only one mile,

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.655
and another might be remote and is 103 miles.

00:00:52.655 --> 00:00:56.890
We could aggregate all of these distances together to show that

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.359
the average distance employees are located from their work is 18 miles.

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:09.099
But now, we want to know how the distance to work varies from one employee to the next.

00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:12.519
We could use the five number summary as a description.

00:01:12.519 --> 00:01:16.780
But if we wanted just one number to talk about the spread,

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.570
we'd probably choose the standard deviation.

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:26.704
The standard deviation is on average how much each observation varies from the mean.

00:01:26.704 --> 00:01:28.480
For this example this is,

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.170
how much on average the distance each person is from

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.915
work differs from the average distance all of them are from work.

00:01:37.915 --> 00:01:41.280
So, this one is three miles farther from work than the average

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.534
while this individual is four miles closer to work than the average.

00:01:45.534 --> 00:01:48.974
The standard deviation is how far on

00:01:48.974 --> 00:01:54.089
average are individuals located from this mean distance.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.500
So, it is like the average of all of these distances.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.829
We will take a closer look at this but hopefully this gives you

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.000
a strong conceptual understanding of what we'll be calculating in the next sections.
