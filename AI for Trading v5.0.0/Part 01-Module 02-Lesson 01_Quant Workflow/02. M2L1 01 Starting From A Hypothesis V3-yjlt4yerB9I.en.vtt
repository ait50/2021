00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.714
Congratulations on making it this far.

00:00:02.714 --> 00:00:04.915
The content you've seen previously,

00:00:04.915 --> 00:00:07.230
will serve as a strong foundation of knowledge

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.940
from which to build your quantitative finance career.

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:12.734
We have a few more concepts to discuss.

00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:14.960
But before we get into the weeds,

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.969
let's take this opportunity to step back for a moment.

00:00:17.969 --> 00:00:20.519
I want to describe the series of steps,

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:24.839
quants go through when developing trading strategies from a big picture of perspective.

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:26.230
So you'll be able to see,

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.320
how each step can contribute to

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.935
the ultimate goal of profiting from a successful trading strategy.

00:00:31.934 --> 00:00:35.140
This will help you understand the point of each school year learning and

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.664
make concepts discussed in the next few videos more clear.

00:00:38.664 --> 00:00:44.420
Fundamentally, quantitative trading is the process of using statistical analysis and

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.420
modeling to predict market behavior and using

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.395
those predictions to make trades with the goal of profit.

00:00:51.395 --> 00:00:54.740
Like any research process understanding and predicting

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.545
market behavior begins with a new idea for how the world might work.

00:00:59.545 --> 00:01:02.079
In other words, a hypothesis.

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.584
A good hypothesis is the first step to making predictions about future behavior.

00:01:07.584 --> 00:01:11.604
Coming up with a good hypothesis means being brutally specific.

00:01:11.605 --> 00:01:15.290
For example, the hypothesis stocks that are discussed in

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.380
the news are likely to go up is not very useful by itself,

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:23.729
because it's so vague that it doesn't lead to testable predictions.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.245
In what news outlet?

00:01:25.245 --> 00:01:26.400
At what time?

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.085
In what manner must the stocks we discussed and for how long will they go up?

00:01:32.084 --> 00:01:37.639
An improved hypothesis would be stocks whose company name or ticker

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.409
appear in the landing page of

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.664
The Wall Street Journal website will increase by price by one percent,

00:01:43.665 --> 00:01:46.100
one day following this appearance.

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:47.689
Although it's far from perfect,

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.269
we can actually test this hypothesis by

00:01:50.269 --> 00:01:53.810
finding the tickers and checking for the change in price.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.695
So how do you come up with a good hypothesis?

00:01:56.694 --> 00:02:01.625
Well, your hypothesis should be based on your current understanding of how markets work.

00:02:01.625 --> 00:02:03.588
So the more you know about the markets,

00:02:03.588 --> 00:02:08.039
the more likely you are able to come up with a new potentially profitable idea.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.389
It can take time to build up the domain knowledge to come up with

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:16.819
a good hypothesis in any field of study and quantitative finance is no exception.

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.155
So how do you build up this domain expertise?

00:02:20.155 --> 00:02:23.634
Well, you can try to immerse yourself in the markets,

00:02:23.634 --> 00:02:26.584
observe the markets, watch financial news,

00:02:26.585 --> 00:02:30.224
read financial newspapers, read books, read blogs,

00:02:30.224 --> 00:02:35.364
and study the known strategies of famous quants and discretionary traders and investors.

00:02:35.365 --> 00:02:38.240
Attend meetings and conferences and read

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.230
academic papers such as those on the Social Science Research Network.

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:45.199
An online repository of scholarly research in

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:48.969
the social sciences including economics and finance.

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:51.710
But no matter who you are or what you know,

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.564
if your hypothesis makes predictions that are inconsistent with the real observed data,

00:02:56.564 --> 00:02:58.925
your hypothesis is wrong.

00:02:58.925 --> 00:03:01.165
The precise manner in which it is wrong,

00:03:01.164 --> 00:03:05.400
when and how, we'll show you how to focus your efforts to improve it.
