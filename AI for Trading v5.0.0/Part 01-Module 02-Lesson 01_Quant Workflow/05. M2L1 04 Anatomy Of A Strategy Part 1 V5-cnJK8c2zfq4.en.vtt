00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.569
Let's zoom in on one of the types of trading strategies we talked

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:06.929
about earlier, cross-sectional equity investing.

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:10.150
This is a deep and important type of trading strategy.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.359
So, let's talk in detail about the pieces needed to build this type of strategy.

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:19.320
In general, you can think of the process of developing this type of

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.175
strategy as having six stages: data selection,

00:00:23.175 --> 00:00:26.289
universe definition, alpha discovery,

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.184
alpha combination, portfolio construction, and trading.

00:00:31.184 --> 00:00:36.769
In the first stage, you need to decide what data set or data sets you want to use.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.010
As we've said, you should start with a hypothesis.

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:44.204
So, you're going to want to get access to the data relevant to testing it.

00:00:44.204 --> 00:00:45.964
In the second stage,

00:00:45.965 --> 00:00:48.560
you need to pare down your data set to a subset that

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.395
contains the stocks you wanted potentially trade.

00:00:51.395 --> 00:00:54.410
You might exclude stocks that have low training volume,

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:56.034
and are therefore, hard to trade.

00:00:56.034 --> 00:00:58.509
But you also want to construct your portfolio,

00:00:58.509 --> 00:01:01.234
so that the stocks in it have similarities,

00:01:01.234 --> 00:01:04.185
so that ranking them is a reasonable thing to do.

00:01:04.185 --> 00:01:08.960
However, since you're looking to benefit from their movements relative to each other,

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:10.774
they shouldn't be too similar.

00:01:10.775 --> 00:01:13.570
You're also going to want to limit your universe to

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:17.259
the stocks to which your hypothesis logically applies.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.955
For example, let's imagine you want to work with the hypothesis discussed in the paper,

00:01:21.954 --> 00:01:24.909
Geographic Momentum by Quoc Nguyen.

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:31.039
This hypothesis is that a momentum effect is created for multinational US companies,

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.445
because investors do not pay attention to foreign market developments.

00:01:35.444 --> 00:01:38.689
So, there is an opportunity to predict increases in

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.700
these company stock prices when markets and countries they're operating in improve.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.015
If you're working with this hypothesis,

00:01:46.015 --> 00:01:48.409
you would only want to work with companies who actually

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.670
have significant foreign market operations.
