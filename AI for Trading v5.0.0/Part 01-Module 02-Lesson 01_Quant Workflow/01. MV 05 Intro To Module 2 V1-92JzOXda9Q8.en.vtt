00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.759
Welcome back. In this set of lessons,

00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:05.150
we're going to expand on the fundamentals even building,

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.480
to prepare you for some neat stuff we'll do later.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.545
We're going to begin with a bird's eye view of strategy development,

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:14.189
so that you understand the stages of this and

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:17.030
how the activities of each stage fit together.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.089
We'll talk about weird data points, outliers,

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:22.370
a discussion that will help you start to get a feel for

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.980
the type of data used in quantitative trading.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.330
We're also going to discuss

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:30.204
the very important concepts of regression and time series analysis,

00:00:30.204 --> 00:00:34.214
which are basic building blocks we'll need to introduce later concepts.

00:00:34.215 --> 00:00:39.290
We'll discuss the very important concept of volatility or variability in returns,

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:41.659
which is frequently used as a measure of risk,

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:45.094
which people in the trading world are constantly talking about.

00:00:45.094 --> 00:00:47.585
Finally, we'll discuss Paris trading,

00:00:47.585 --> 00:00:50.250
another very important type of trading strategy.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.149
This set of lessons is designed to help you build out your understanding of the ideas,

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.410
data, tools, and concepts,

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:01.239
fundamental to trading strategies. Let's go for it.
