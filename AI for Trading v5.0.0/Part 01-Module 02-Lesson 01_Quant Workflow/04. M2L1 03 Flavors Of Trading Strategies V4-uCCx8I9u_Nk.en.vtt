00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.205
There are several flavors of trading strategies.

00:00:03.205 --> 00:00:07.495
The most basic type is based on buying and selling a single asset.

00:00:07.495 --> 00:00:12.445
An example of this type of strategy might be just trading the S&amp;P 500.

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:14.790
You could track the performance of the S&amp;P over

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:18.224
time and enter positions based on past performance.

00:00:18.225 --> 00:00:21.660
For example, if the S&amp;P has been doing well for a while,

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.995
you might enter a long position under the assumption that it has momentum.

00:00:25.995 --> 00:00:29.760
Another common strategy is to find pairs of assets that seemed to be

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.675
related and trade based on their relative movements.

00:00:33.674 --> 00:00:36.195
These are called pairwise strategies.

00:00:36.195 --> 00:00:40.189
For example, say there are two big companies in the beverage industry,

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:44.159
these companies are probably subject to many in the same market affects,

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:45.594
the price of ingredients,

00:00:45.594 --> 00:00:47.570
the cost of shipping et cetera.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.560
If one stock starts to appreciate more than the other,

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.480
you might think that the laggard will eventually catch up.

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:58.024
A pairwise strategy would make trades to try to capture this differential.

00:00:58.024 --> 00:01:03.244
Another class of trading strategy extends this idea to groups of stocks,

00:01:03.244 --> 00:01:07.159
these are called cross-sectional strategies also known as

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.099
equity statistical arbitrage or equity market neutral investing.

00:01:11.099 --> 00:01:14.659
This is a popular type of strategy and involves comparing

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.334
hundreds to thousands of stocks to determine which to hold

00:01:18.334 --> 00:01:22.189
in long and short portfolios with the goal of benefiting from

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:27.170
transient market phenomena without being subject to overall market movements.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.335
The comparison is often based on price and or volume or fundamental information.

00:01:33.334 --> 00:01:36.679
A momentum signal where you rank stocks based on the strength of

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.940
prior returns over a given period is an example of a cross-sectional strategy.

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.414
Finally, there's a class of strategies based primarily on new types of data,

00:01:47.415 --> 00:01:49.920
such as satellite imagery, social media,

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.924
geolocation or consumer transaction data.

00:01:52.924 --> 00:01:58.364
Large hedge funds and asset managers are most interested in strategies three and four.

00:01:58.364 --> 00:02:02.134
These are the two we spend most of the time on in this nano-degree.

00:02:02.135 --> 00:02:05.660
Why is this? Two reasons: first,

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.030
large professional market participants by

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.919
definition have large amounts of capital to put to work.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:15.004
As such, they desire strategies with high capacity,

00:02:15.004 --> 00:02:18.889
this means the strategy can be put to work at a meaningful asset level and

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:23.234
this is most often achieved by trading very many stocks.

00:02:23.235 --> 00:02:27.135
Cross-sectional strategies all other things being equal,

00:02:27.134 --> 00:02:28.969
have the highest capacity.

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:33.965
Second, professional market participants are looking for differentiated ideas.

00:02:33.965 --> 00:02:36.955
Given the proliferation of alternative data,

00:02:36.955 --> 00:02:40.130
many funds hope to uncover signals in hard-to-find,

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.009
expensive and difficult to work with data.

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:46.129
We will talk about that later in this nano degree.
