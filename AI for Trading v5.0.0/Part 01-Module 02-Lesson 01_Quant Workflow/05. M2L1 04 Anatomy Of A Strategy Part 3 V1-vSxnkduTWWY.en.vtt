00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390
Eventually, you will arrive at the stage where

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.125
you want to start thinking about how your strategy will work in practice.

00:00:07.125 --> 00:00:09.835
This is the portfolio construction stage,

00:00:09.835 --> 00:00:11.760
he stage where you have to think about using

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.064
your combined alpha vector to generate and update an actual portfolio.

00:00:16.065 --> 00:00:17.945
At every time iteration,

00:00:17.945 --> 00:00:20.914
your strategy is going to take an existing portfolio,

00:00:20.914 --> 00:00:25.640
make predictions about market behavior using your combined alpha vector and use

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.194
this information to make trades that move the existing portfolio to an updated portfolio.

00:00:31.193 --> 00:00:34.100
There are more questions that must be answered when turning

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.550
your market hypothesis into traits such as,

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:41.474
how does your strategy take into account in various forms of risk?

00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:44.945
What quantities should your portfolio seek to optimize?

00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:48.270
Are there any additional constraints on your portfolio?

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.635
How do real-world constraints like transaction costs

00:00:51.634 --> 00:00:55.554
eat into the theoretical return and how can these be mitigated?

00:00:55.554 --> 00:00:59.195
Let's talk in a bit more detail about some of these questions.

00:00:59.195 --> 00:01:03.020
You probably already have an intuitive sense of what a risk is.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.630
It's uncertainty about the future, and in particular,

00:01:06.629 --> 00:01:09.179
the possibility that something bad will happen,

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.620
like losing the money you invested.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.410
In finance, risk usually refers to uncertainty or

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.724
variability in returns and there are many different ways to quantify it mathematically.

00:01:20.724 --> 00:01:22.984
There are different types of risks.

00:01:22.984 --> 00:01:27.325
Risks inherent in the entire market are called systematic risks.

00:01:27.325 --> 00:01:32.515
One form of systematic risk is risk inherent to individual sectors,

00:01:32.515 --> 00:01:37.689
like the technology sector or the energy sector called sector-specific risk.

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:40.879
For example, the success of the energy sector as a

00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:44.839
whole might be affected by fluctuations in the price of oil,

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.150
but it's unlikely that this would affect the technology sector nearly as much.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.700
Risk inherent to individual stocks is called idiosyncratic or specific risk.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.180
For example, a single oil company might be uniquely affected by

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.560
political events in a region of the world in which it is exploring for oil.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.969
Your strategy will likely incorporate a mathematical model in these risks,

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.210
which will help you understand and manage the different types of risks

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.110
and attempt to avoid being overly exposed to anyone.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.390
Different investment funds have

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:20.909
different mandates driven by the goals of their investors.

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:25.460
For example, some funds will want to be neutral to all systematic risk.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.415
Whereas, other funds have a specific target for that risk.

00:02:29.414 --> 00:02:34.039
Your portfolio could be designed to maximize different objectives.

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:40.120
As one example, you could seek to maximize expected return and minimize return variance.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.730
In this case, if two portfolios have the same expected return,

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:46.449
you would choose the one with lower variance.

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:51.804
Finally, your portfolio may be subject to additional requirements or constraints.

00:02:51.805 --> 00:02:55.400
For example, the policies of your investment firm may dictate

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.109
that you can't hold stocks below a certain level of market capitalization,

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:00.800
or you may only be allowed to enter

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.570
long positions due to government regulations in certain markets,

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.250
or there may be a limit on what percentage of

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.120
your portfolio can be invested in any single stock.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.825
These must be taken into account during portfolio design.

00:03:15.824 --> 00:03:18.750
Finally, in the training stage,

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.094
you make actual trades in the market.

00:03:21.094 --> 00:03:23.750
After portfolio construction, you'll have

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.069
an ideal portfolio and a list of trades to make.

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.039
In this stage, you'll have to figure out mechanics like how

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:35.734
fast to trade and to which time horizon you believe your alpha applies.

00:03:35.735 --> 00:03:38.510
You may decide to trade quickly and aggressively,

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:40.625
or more slowly and passively.

00:03:40.625 --> 00:03:44.270
You'll also have to take into account the fact that the trades

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.125
themselves incur costs which will eat into your returns.

00:03:48.125 --> 00:03:52.139
This is the realm of market microstructure and high-frequency trading.

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:58.144
Finally, spends market conditions don't allow you to place the exact trades you intend.

00:03:58.145 --> 00:04:02.475
As you can see, there's a lot to think about during this process.

00:04:02.474 --> 00:04:03.799
So, let's get on with it.
