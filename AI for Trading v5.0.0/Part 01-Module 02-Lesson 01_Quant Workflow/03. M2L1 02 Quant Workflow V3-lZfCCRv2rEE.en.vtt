00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
A hypothesis that forms the basis of a trading strategy must

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.179
survive several phases of increasingly rigorous testing.

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:10.750
This process can be different at different companies,

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.509
banks, or hedge funds, but usually,

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:16.664
there is an initial exploratory research phase during which

00:00:16.664 --> 00:00:20.429
ideas are generated and validated in a fairly basic way.

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:24.804
The goal here is to come up with promising ideas relatively quickly.

00:00:24.804 --> 00:00:26.570
In the research phase,

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.240
you will focus on determining what set of positions to enter,

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:32.774
on which assets at which times.

00:00:32.774 --> 00:00:36.488
Such that you have the potential to get positive future returns.

00:00:36.488 --> 00:00:41.794
Later on, you'll incorporate other factors critical to a full-fledged trading strategy.

00:00:41.795 --> 00:00:44.070
How much money to invest in each asset,

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.659
under what conditions to exit positions,

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:49.449
factoring in the costs of making trades,

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.100
and what risks constraints to impose?

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.000
The process of rigorously simulating the entire flow in

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.500
an automated fashion using historical data is called Backtesting.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.879
It is important to resist the temptation to jump right into full-fledged backtesting.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.399
We'll talk about the reasons for this when we discuss overfitting in depth.
