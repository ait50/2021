00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.884
The alpha discovery phase is where the fun really starts.

00:00:03.884 --> 00:00:06.285
This is when you start looking for alphas,

00:00:06.285 --> 00:00:08.560
but what are alphas exactly?

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.640
An alpha is an expression applied to

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.910
the cross-section over your universe of stocks which returns

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.850
a vector of real numbers whose values are

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.665
proportional to the size of the position you will take on each asset.

00:00:22.664 --> 00:00:27.774
You can think of the numerical output of an alpha as providing an indication,

00:00:27.774 --> 00:00:29.820
or metric of conviction about

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.880
future returns which will ultimately inform a trading decision.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.920
When you have discovered a successful alpha,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.015
the value in that vector for each stock is directly proportional

00:00:41.015 --> 00:00:45.844
to the rank of its return at a future time across the universe of stocks.

00:00:45.844 --> 00:00:49.674
For example, in a cross-sectional momentum strategy,

00:00:49.674 --> 00:00:52.399
we rank the stocks according to how much momentum

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.429
they have as measured by a momentum indicator.

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:58.789
We use the ranks to decide which stocks to put in along

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.615
portfolio and which stocks to put in a short portfolio at every time interval.

00:01:03.615 --> 00:01:08.829
In this scenario, you can think of the logic that produces the ranks as the alpha,

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:11.929
and the ranks themselves as the alpha vector.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.740
Taken together, the ranks are a vector of numbers that help

00:01:15.739 --> 00:01:20.109
inform the trading decision of which docs to hold long and short,

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:22.170
and in what amounts.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.275
An alpha is one type of trading signal.

00:01:25.275 --> 00:01:28.160
A trading signal is a general term for

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.659
any numerical signal that can be used to inform a trade.

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:33.734
It could just be a single number.

00:01:33.734 --> 00:01:39.200
Therefore, alphas which are vectors are a subset of trading signals.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.835
The alpha discovery phase can also be called the signal research phase.

00:01:43.834 --> 00:01:47.959
This stage is where you test your hypothesis and see if you can come up with

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:52.254
evidence that your idea may lead to strong future returns.

00:01:52.254 --> 00:01:54.509
This will be an iterative process.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.070
However, in modern markets,

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:59.449
it's rare that a single alpha will provide

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.909
sufficiently consistent positive returns

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.814
to provide the sole basis of an investment strategy.

00:02:04.814 --> 00:02:08.719
Typically, several alphas will be combined together to generate

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:13.125
an overall alpha that has better performance than the best individual alpha.

00:02:13.125 --> 00:02:15.500
This is akin to the ideas of model

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.055
stacking and ensembling in traditional machine learning.

00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:22.025
Combining alphas that have diverse inputs and

00:02:22.025 --> 00:02:26.730
underlying hypotheses can lead to a high-quality combined alpha vector.

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:31.699
For example, a price-driven alpha such as the momentum alpha may

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:34.009
combined well with an alpha based on

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:37.674
company fundamentals since the inputs are very different.

00:02:37.675 --> 00:02:44.070
In this phase, alphas may be combined using simple logic like adding ranks are averaging,

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.689
or through more complicated waiting schemes like finding

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:51.965
the weights that lead to the lowest possible variance for the combined alpha.

00:02:51.965 --> 00:02:56.450
Another possible method is to translate your alphas into features and use them as

00:02:56.449 --> 00:03:01.524
inputs to a machine learning classifier to capture the relationships between the alphas.

00:03:01.525 --> 00:03:05.330
The output of this stage is a single alpha vector that

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.270
incorporates the information of many individual alphas.
