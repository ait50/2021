00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.730
In this lesson, we'll learn about two properties of financial assets,

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.480
mean reversion, and co-integration.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.200
Based on these properties,

00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:12.594
we will learn about the trading strategy called, Paris trading.

00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:18.300
From there, we will examine the more general strategy called, mean reversion trading.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.495
First, let's preview some concepts.

00:00:21.495 --> 00:00:24.320
What is mean reversion?

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.890
A mean reverting time series is one that tends to

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.475
move back and forth around some constant value.

00:00:31.475 --> 00:00:34.765
When applying mean reversion to a single stock,

00:00:34.765 --> 00:00:39.185
we could check when the stock price deviates significantly from the mean.

00:00:39.185 --> 00:00:44.915
For example, we may see a stock decline significantly below its historical average.

00:00:44.914 --> 00:00:47.990
Assuming the stock will revert to its mean,

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:54.325
we may buy the stock and anticipate that it will increase back to its original price.

00:00:54.325 --> 00:00:59.685
There is still the risk that the stock price does not return to its historical mean.

00:00:59.685 --> 00:01:04.034
For example, the stock may settle at its new, lower value.

00:01:04.034 --> 00:01:07.569
Even worse, it might just keep declining.

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:13.264
In practice it's more common to apply mean reversion to a pair of stocks.

00:01:13.265 --> 00:01:17.310
Let's imagine that two companies are economically linked.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.144
By economically linked, I mean that they may be in the same line of business,

00:01:22.144 --> 00:01:24.464
may be operating in the same country,

00:01:24.465 --> 00:01:28.385
and may have similar types of products or customers.

00:01:28.385 --> 00:01:30.829
We can imagine that the stock prices of

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:35.310
these two companies may also move up and down in a similar way.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.200
Since these companies move up together and down together,

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.019
they appear to have a consistent relationship that

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:45.209
we can expect will continue into the near future.

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:50.655
So, when we see the prices of these two similar companies diverge significantly,

00:01:50.655 --> 00:01:56.885
we may make trading decisions based on the assumption that this divergence is temporary.

00:01:56.885 --> 00:02:00.955
The view of our trading strategy is that later in the future,

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:05.060
the prices will settle back to their original relationship.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.870
We'll examine these concepts in more detail in the rest of this lesson.
