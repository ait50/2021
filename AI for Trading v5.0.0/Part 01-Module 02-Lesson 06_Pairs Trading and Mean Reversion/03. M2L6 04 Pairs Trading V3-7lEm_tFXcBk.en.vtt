00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.314
Let's take a closer look at pairs trade.

00:00:03.314 --> 00:00:06.540
When two companies have economic links,

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.025
this implies that their stock prices may also move in a similar manner.

00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:14.759
For example, company A sells frozen green peas,

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.059
and company B cells frozen carrots.

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:22.589
Since frozen peas and carrots are often combined and sold together,

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:28.204
we can see how an increase in sales of peas and carrots would affect both companies.

00:00:28.204 --> 00:00:32.140
Most of the time we see the two stocks moving similarly.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.859
However, we may see the two start to diverge.

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:40.159
When this happens, we use our assumption about their economic ties,

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:43.625
and also our assumption about mean-reversion.

00:00:43.625 --> 00:00:47.060
We assume that the divergence is temporary and that

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.185
the two stock values will revert back to their original long-term relationship.

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:57.255
The pairs trade involves going long the asset that is priced relatively low.

00:00:57.255 --> 00:00:58.695
At the same time,

00:00:58.695 --> 00:01:03.765
the strategy involves going short the asset that is priced relatively high.

00:01:03.765 --> 00:01:08.655
If and when the prices start to converge we can close our positions.

00:01:08.655 --> 00:01:11.204
When I say we close our positions,

00:01:11.204 --> 00:01:13.969
I mean that we sell the asset that we originally

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:17.900
buy and we buy the asset that we initially shorted.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.830
Also, if we see the stocks do not converge but continue to diverge over a period of time,

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:28.875
we may also decide to close our positions to cut our losses.

00:01:28.875 --> 00:01:34.459
You may be wondering how long we should wait before expecting to see the pairs converge.

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:37.219
It helps to look at historical trends.

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:40.250
Sometimes pairs of socks diverge and then

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.180
converge in cycles that may last weeks or months.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:50.700
Some traders may decide to trade in shorter time horizons such as in days or even hours.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.930
For these shorter time periods traders may look for

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.145
smaller movements to determine what they consider diverging, or converging trends.

00:01:59.144 --> 00:02:03.634
There are benefits to trading a pair rather than a single stock.

00:02:03.635 --> 00:02:07.825
Trading a pair reduces our exposure to the overall market.

00:02:07.825 --> 00:02:10.400
For example, with a single stock,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.439
we may expect a stock's recent price decline to be temporary.

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:19.370
However, if a negative jobs report causes most stocks to decline

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.444
then this overall market movement would carry this single stock downward with it.

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:29.150
With partnering, we reduce some of the impact of large market movements.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.500
So, even if both stocks in the pair are pulled down by a general market downturn,

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.425
what matters to us is the relative difference between the pair of stocks.

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:42.350
To describe this relative difference between a pair of

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.250
stocks we will look into the spread and the hedge ratio.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.439
While the pair of stocks are still converged or linked,

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:55.819
we can imagine holding a long position in stock A and a short position in stock B.

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.120
Our positions are in a certain proportion so that

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.895
our combined position has a constant value over time.

00:03:02.895 --> 00:03:09.320
In other words, movements in our long position and short position cancel each other out.

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.034
The proportion that lets us create this neutral position is called the hedge ratio.

00:03:14.034 --> 00:03:19.270
There are two ways to calculate the hedge ratio and they tend to have similar results.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.155
One way is to take the price of stock B divided by the price of stock A,

00:03:24.155 --> 00:03:26.050
or the price ratio.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.680
A second way is to run a linear regression in which stock A is

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.460
the independent variable and stock B is the dependent variable.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:41.534
The coefficient of this regression is our hedge ratio and is similar to the price ratio.

00:03:41.534 --> 00:03:45.109
The difference is that the regression accounts for a series of

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:51.185
previous prices while the price ratio uses just the most recent price of each stock.

00:03:51.185 --> 00:03:55.164
Once we have a hedge ratio we can calculate the spread.

00:03:55.164 --> 00:04:01.329
The spread is the price of B minus the product of the hedge ratio and price of A.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.995
This may look familiar from our studies of regression.

00:04:04.995 --> 00:04:09.980
When we used a regression model to estimate the dependent variable we compared

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:15.694
the prediction with the actual value and called it a residual or error term.

00:04:15.694 --> 00:04:18.769
Here, we can think of using the hedge ratio to

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.129
estimate the price of B using the price of A.

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:27.625
We still expect a difference between the estimation and the actual price of B.

00:04:27.625 --> 00:04:33.329
This difference between the estimation and actual value is called the spread.
