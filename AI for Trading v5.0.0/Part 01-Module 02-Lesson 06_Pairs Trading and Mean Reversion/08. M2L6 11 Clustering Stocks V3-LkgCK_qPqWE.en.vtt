00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.275
Let's see how we would find cointegrated pairs from a universe of stocks.

00:00:05.275 --> 00:00:10.339
For example, we might look at companies listed in the S&amp;P 500.

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:15.314
If we were to compare every pair of stocks this would take a long time.

00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:20.839
More importantly, we would end up with spurious false positives just by chance.

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:25.504
It's important to partition our universe of stocks into meaningful groups.

00:00:25.504 --> 00:00:28.994
One way is to group stocks by sector or industry.

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:32.425
However, since grouping by sector is quite popular,

00:00:32.424 --> 00:00:37.569
we want to find other relationships that are not as obvious but still meaningful.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.405
One way to find meaningful but less obvious groups is to use

00:00:41.405 --> 00:00:45.939
a class of unsupervised machine learning algorithms called clustering.

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:50.030
The inputs to the clustering algorithm are the time series themselves.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.300
More similar time series get grouped together.

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:56.659
Note that after clustering we still want to analyze

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:01.799
the fundamental relationships between pairs of stocks that exhibit co integration.
