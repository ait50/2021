00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.609
It's also important to decide how we

00:00:02.609 --> 00:00:06.165
define when two stocks are diverging from there spread.

00:00:06.165 --> 00:00:09.625
For this, we want to choose a threshold.

00:00:09.625 --> 00:00:12.054
If the spread exceeds the threshold,

00:00:12.054 --> 00:00:13.800
then we can assume that the spread is

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.394
temporary and will revert back to its historical mean.

00:00:17.394 --> 00:00:20.039
We can have two kinds of thresholds.

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.364
One threshold, tells us that the spread is much wider than its historical average.

00:00:25.364 --> 00:00:28.079
Another threshold, can tell us that the spread is

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:30.899
much narrower than its historical average.

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:33.439
When the spread is unusually wide,

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:36.835
the action we take is called shorting the spread.

00:00:36.835 --> 00:00:38.865
We say we're shorting the spread,

00:00:38.865 --> 00:00:42.385
because we expect the spread to get smaller in the future.

00:00:42.384 --> 00:00:45.989
Conversely, when the spread is unusually narrow,

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.620
the action we take is called going long the spread.

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:53.149
We say we're going long the spread or buying

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.439
the spread because we expect the spread to get larger in the future.

00:00:57.439 --> 00:01:01.434
Let's discuss what it means to go long or short spread.

00:01:01.435 --> 00:01:03.225
When the spread widens,

00:01:03.225 --> 00:01:05.394
we decide to short the spread.

00:01:05.394 --> 00:01:11.304
This means, that we short the asset that has increased relative to the spread.

00:01:11.305 --> 00:01:16.250
We also buy the asset that has declined relative to the spread.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.305
Some of our previous examples involved shorting the spread.

00:01:20.305 --> 00:01:23.405
Conversely, when we see this spread narrow,

00:01:23.405 --> 00:01:25.950
we decided to go long the spread.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.159
This means that we buy the asset that has declined relative to the spread.

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.689
We also short the asset that has increased relative to the spread.

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.424
If this concept sounds a bit confusing,

00:01:38.424 --> 00:01:41.704
just to remember to buy low and sell high.

00:01:41.704 --> 00:01:44.594
In other words, buy when it's on sale,

00:01:44.594 --> 00:01:46.969
and sell when it's overpriced.

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:49.039
The way we define these thresholds,

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.100
is by calculating how many standard deviations the spread is from its historical average.

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:58.059
This is called the Z-score of spread.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.370
A Z-score of positive one,

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.655
means that a value is one standard deviation greater than its historical mean.

00:02:05.655 --> 00:02:07.585
To calculate the Z-score,

00:02:07.584 --> 00:02:11.894
we subtracted the mean and divide by the standard deviation.

00:02:11.895 --> 00:02:14.110
As with all modeling,

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.120
is necessary to perform backtesting.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.525
By backtesting, I mean that we want to test our model on historical data.

00:02:22.525 --> 00:02:28.129
We want to test in a way that simulates the model making predictions in real time.

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:32.784
We don't want to expose the model to data that occurs in the future.

00:02:32.784 --> 00:02:38.155
To perform backtesting, we divide our historical data into a training set,

00:02:38.155 --> 00:02:41.659
a validation set, and a test set.

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:46.180
The training set has earlier data up to a cutoff date,

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.490
the validation set has data that occurs after

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.100
the training set up to and even later cutoff date,

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.784
the test set contains data that occurs after the validation set.

00:02:57.784 --> 00:03:00.504
We train our model on the training set,

00:03:00.504 --> 00:03:04.530
then do intermediate checks using the validation set.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.449
This allows us to adjust our model to help it perform more accurate estimates.

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:15.109
When we've adjusted our model to the point that we think it's ready to use,

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.490
we then check it against the test set to see if it really works.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:25.260
Note that, it's important not to use the test set until we're done optimizing the model.

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:29.810
If we were to adjust the model after using the final test set,

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.530
this would be like letting our model cheat by showing it information about the future.
