00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.219
Let's add more detail to describe the relationship between a pair of stocks.

00:00:05.219 --> 00:00:11.314
Recall that some time series such as stock prices are integrated of order one.

00:00:11.314 --> 00:00:15.644
By this, I mean that if we take the time difference of this time series,

00:00:15.644 --> 00:00:17.899
we can get a stationary series.

00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:20.269
When a series is stationary,

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.219
it is also integrated of order zero.

00:00:23.219 --> 00:00:26.369
Another way to get a stationery process is to

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.835
find some linear combination of a pair of stocks.

00:00:29.835 --> 00:00:35.170
For example, if stock X and stock Y have an economic link,

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.524
then if we subtract one from the other,

00:00:37.524 --> 00:00:40.875
we may get a time series that is stationary.

00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:46.274
More generally, we multiply X by hedge ratio using regression.

00:00:46.274 --> 00:00:52.829
Then we take Y minus the estimate of Y based on the hedge ratio and the value of X.

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.354
This difference is the spread.

00:00:55.354 --> 00:00:57.625
If the spread is stationary,

00:00:57.625 --> 00:01:00.215
then it is integrated of order zero.

00:01:00.215 --> 00:01:03.030
Also if the spread is stationary,

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.555
then we say that the original series of X and Y are cointegrated.

00:01:08.555 --> 00:01:13.920
The hedge ratio is also called the coefficient of cointegration.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.099
Note that cointegration is not the same as correlation.

00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:24.359
Correlation is the covariance re-scaled to range from negative one to positive one.

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:29.420
A strong positive correlation means that when stock A moves up,

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.225
stock B moves up at the same time and vice versa.

00:01:33.224 --> 00:01:38.609
However, if the magnitude of movement in one stock is greater than the other,

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:42.594
then they can still drift apart even though they are correlated.

00:01:42.594 --> 00:01:47.819
In other words, two correlated stocks may not be cointegrated.

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:51.054
Cointegration means that, over a range of days,

00:01:51.055 --> 00:01:55.845
the relative increase in A is matched by a relative increase in B.

00:01:55.844 --> 00:02:02.420
Let's imagine that we use $100 to buy stock A and $100 to buy stock B.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.739
Assuming these are cointegrated,

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:08.599
the value of both positions would remain similar over time.

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:14.254
So keep in mind that a pair of stocks may be correlated but not cointegrated.

00:02:14.254 --> 00:02:20.129
Similarly, a pair of stocks may be cointegrated but not correlated.

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:25.835
For pairs trading, we want to find pairs of stocks that are cointegrated.

00:02:25.835 --> 00:02:32.165
The method for checking if two series are cointegrated is called the Engle-Granger Test.

00:02:32.164 --> 00:02:36.929
The Engle-Granger Test involves two steps that we saw previously.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.105
One, find the hedge ratio using regression.

00:02:41.104 --> 00:02:46.319
Two, calculate the spread and test if the spread is stationary.

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.484
If the spread is stationary,

00:02:48.485 --> 00:02:51.335
then the two series are cointegrated.

00:02:51.335 --> 00:02:53.460
To check if the spread is stationary,

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.480
we use the Augmented Dickey-FullerTest.

00:02:56.479 --> 00:03:00.500
The Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test outputs a P-value.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.490
If the P-value is small, say,

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.384
0.05 or less, then we can assume that the spread is stationary.

00:03:08.383 --> 00:03:12.669
Therefore, we can assume that the two are cointegrated.
