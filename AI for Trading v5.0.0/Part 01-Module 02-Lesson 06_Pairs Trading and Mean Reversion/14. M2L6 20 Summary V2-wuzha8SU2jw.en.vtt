00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
Now that you've reached the end of this lesson,

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.009
we hope you've gained a better understanding of

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.934
pairs trading and mean reversion in general.

00:00:07.934 --> 00:00:12.314
Remember that mean reversion trading follows these general steps.

00:00:12.314 --> 00:00:18.230
Find a pair of assets or a pair of portfolios that have some economic link,

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.554
compute the hedge ratio,

00:00:20.554 --> 00:00:24.079
use the hedge ratio to compute the spread,

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:27.144
test whether the spread is stationary,

00:00:27.144 --> 00:00:29.164
if the spread is stationary,

00:00:29.164 --> 00:00:33.600
consider the pair a candidate for mean reversion trading.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.990
Next, choose thresholds for the spread.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:42.135
When the spread widens beyond its historical average, short the spread.

00:00:42.134 --> 00:00:45.464
When the spread narrows beyond its historical average,

00:00:45.465 --> 00:00:47.405
go along the spread.

00:00:47.405 --> 00:00:49.304
Most important of all,

00:00:49.304 --> 00:00:52.009
remember to backtest your model.

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:57.799
We hope you've enjoyed learning about mean reversion and pairs trading. Bye for now.
