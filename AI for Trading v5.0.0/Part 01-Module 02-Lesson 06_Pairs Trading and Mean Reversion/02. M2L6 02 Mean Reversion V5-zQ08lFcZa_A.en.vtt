00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.919
Let's look at mean reversion in detail.

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:07.169
We can plot a stock's price movements against its moving average.

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:10.349
We tend to see that when the price increases or

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.289
decreases significantly from this moving average,

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:17.039
the price then reverts back towards this moving average.

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.484
To describe a mean reverting process with some math,

00:00:20.484 --> 00:00:24.140
we'll use what's called the Drift and Volatility model.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.250
To guide our understanding,

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.309
we'll imagine the stock movement as a boat that is floating passively in the ocean.

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:35.060
The change in price of an asset over a period of time is

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.469
a sum of a long-term average plus some randomness.

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:41.674
This long-term average is called

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:46.554
the drift term because it changes over time, but relatively slowly.

00:00:46.554 --> 00:00:49.189
Hence, the long-term average is like

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:53.164
the ocean current that slowly and steadily carries the boat.

00:00:53.164 --> 00:00:55.579
The amount of drift depends upon

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.500
the current price and the amount of time that has passed.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.200
The random part of the price change is called the Volatility Term.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.005
We can think of this volatility component as all the fish,

00:01:09.004 --> 00:01:12.795
dolphins or even whales that bump into the boat.

00:01:12.795 --> 00:01:18.500
All of these little bumps move the boat in a more random path around it stripped.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.099
The volatility term depends on the current price,

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:26.015
a standard deviation and the amount of time that passes.

00:01:26.015 --> 00:01:29.950
The standard deviation is small when the markets are calm,

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.130
so it's like encountering a small group of fish.

00:01:33.129 --> 00:01:37.685
The standard deviation may become large during a market crash.

00:01:37.685 --> 00:01:41.245
This would be like encountering a group of wales.

00:01:41.245 --> 00:01:46.045
With math, the Drift and Volatility model looks like this.

00:01:46.045 --> 00:01:51.415
The dp_t on the left represents the change in price over the time

00:01:51.415 --> 00:01:57.219
t. The first term to the right of the equal sign a is the drift term.

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:00.515
The drift term is made up of the current price,

00:02:00.515 --> 00:02:02.560
a constant average mu,

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.545
and the change in time.

00:02:04.545 --> 00:02:08.104
The second term on the right is the volatility term.

00:02:08.104 --> 00:02:11.569
The volatility term is made up of the current price,

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.750
a standard deviation sigma,

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.159
a random noise factor epsilon and the square root of the change in time.

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.435
If this equation feels intimidating, don't worry.

00:02:22.435 --> 00:02:26.504
For now, just think about the boat drifting in the ocean,

00:02:26.504 --> 00:02:31.129
encountering fish, dolphins and maybe even some tropical islands.
