00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.254
To find good pairs to trade,

00:00:02.254 --> 00:00:06.330
we want to find pairs of companies that have economic links.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.509
It's common to find stocks that are in the same sector and country.

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:15.019
It's also good to look for a less obvious but still meaningful connections.

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.419
For instance, companies that trade internationally

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.920
maybe affected by trade decisions by their respective governments.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.850
For example, steel companies in the United States and steel companies in

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:32.350
China maybe influenced by political decisions made in either or both countries.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:37.510
Two companies may be suppliers and customers within the same supply chain.

00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:42.064
For instance, a textile supplier sells to a clothing retailer.

00:00:42.064 --> 00:00:45.399
A decline in clothing sales may impact the retailer

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.614
first and then impact the textile supplier a bit later.

00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:54.625
Two similar companies maybe trading in separate countries and time zones.

00:00:54.625 --> 00:00:58.450
For example, a pharmaceutical company in India may see

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.605
its stock rise due to strong international demand for its medicines.

00:01:02.604 --> 00:01:04.329
A few hours later,

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:08.995
a similar pharmaceutical company in Germany may also see its stock rise.

00:01:08.995 --> 00:01:11.265
Notice in the last two examples,

00:01:11.265 --> 00:01:17.155
we see a lag between when one stock moves and the other moves in the same direction.

00:01:17.155 --> 00:01:21.640
A time lag is a good scenario to look for in pairs trading.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:28.549
If we see stock A move upwards and expect Stock B to move upwards later as well,

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.409
then we can place a trade after Stock A moves,

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.069
but before stock B moves.

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:36.899
After Stock B moves as expected,

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.225
we can close our positions.

00:01:39.224 --> 00:01:43.140
Once we found a pair of stocks based on economic links,

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.780
we can check if those stocks are in fact good candidates for pairs trading.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.650
We check the pair by calculating the spread.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.355
If the spread appears constant over time, it's likely stationary.

00:01:55.355 --> 00:01:59.130
Recall that a series is stationary when its mean,

00:01:59.129 --> 00:02:02.839
variance and co-variance are stable over time.
