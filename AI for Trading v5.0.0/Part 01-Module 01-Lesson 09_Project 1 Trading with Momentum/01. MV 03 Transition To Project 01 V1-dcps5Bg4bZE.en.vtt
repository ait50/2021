00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.975
Congratulations on getting through your first batch of lessons.

00:00:03.975 --> 00:00:08.595
Next on your agenda is your first project, trading with momentum,

00:00:08.595 --> 00:00:12.255
where you'll implement a momentum trading strategy and perform

00:00:12.255 --> 00:00:15.950
a statistical test to conclude if there's alpha in the signal.

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:17.780
That sounds like a really interesting project.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.440
Does a bode on the learning we've been doing up until now?

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.080
It does. This project will give you an overview of the Quant workflow.

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:27.459
By preprocessing data with pandas,

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.320
implementing a trading signal,

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.059
and evaluating it's performance.

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:32.579
Sounds like students will get a chance to

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.559
use all the skills they've been building up until now,

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.945
but in a really industry-relevant way.

00:00:36.945 --> 00:00:40.880
Completely. We'll use this foundation in later lessons

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.840
where you'll learn more advanced techniques to generate trading signals,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.405
construct a portfolio, and evaluate its performance.

00:00:48.405 --> 00:00:51.480
That's awesome. Projects are a super powerful learning tool,

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:54.199
they give you a chance to bring together all the skills and knowledge you've built

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.240
up until now and apply them in new and interesting ways.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.825
Totally. I love doing projects.

00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:01.880
They certainly can feel a bit challenging,

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.710
but even though I don't always see the solution straight away,

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:06.839
they help me grow in really meaningful ways.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.250
Totally. That's a great point.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.685
Since projects are these big learning opportunities,

00:01:10.685 --> 00:01:12.814
it's totally normal to find them challenging.

00:01:12.814 --> 00:01:14.450
Luckily, in your Nanodegree Program,

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.799
you get to iterate on your projects just like you do with work in the real world.

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.609
That's right. You'll get personalized feedback on each project you do from

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:26.000
our expert project reviewers that will help you see what

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.129
you've learned already and how you can keep learning and improving your work.

00:01:30.129 --> 00:01:33.069
If your project doesn't meet the specifications the first

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:36.779
time or even a number times beyond that, that's totally normal.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.609
Yeah. Again, projects themselves are meant to stretch your knowledge and skills,

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:43.064
not just give you a chance to show off what you've already learned.

00:01:43.064 --> 00:01:45.515
It's the same as with the quizzes in the Udacity classroom,

00:01:45.515 --> 00:01:47.480
you get to play around and practice with them,

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.540
trying them as many times as you want to or need to to keep growing.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.390
Everything you do at Udacity is intended to help you learn,

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.180
and you are in the driver's seat.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.050
Good luck with project one, and have fun.
