00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.535
Hi. We're back with Thomas John,

00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:04.330
a Quantitative Portfolio Manager,

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.870
to talk about AI and finance.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.405
So Thomas, based on your experience,

00:00:09.405 --> 00:00:12.405
how is AI applied in quant finance today?

00:00:12.405 --> 00:00:14.760
To be honest, not a whole lot yet.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.975
Only the largest firms are applying AI in any form directly,

00:00:18.975 --> 00:00:21.765
although many might be consuming it indirectly.

00:00:21.765 --> 00:00:24.750
For example, in the form of a data stream that might have been

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.875
constructed by a vendor using some machine learning technique.

00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:34.260
The flip side of that is great news for aspiring quants who wanted to use AI.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.820
There's a lot of unchartered territory to explore and contribute to.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.480
Another favorable tailwind is that

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.680
financial firms are far more keen than earlier for investing in machine learning,

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.510
regardless of where they stand on the spectrum of skepticism of the utility of AI.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.780
Most are making a concerted effort

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.110
to integrate machine learning into various parts of their business.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.690
Large firms on the buy side,

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.485
like Blackrock and on the sell side like JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs,

00:01:03.485 --> 00:01:07.340
are hiring people with expertise in machine learning for working on

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.170
topics ranging from liquidity analysis to execution algorithms.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.930
So applications of AI in

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.174
quant finance are not limited to systematic investment departments alone.

00:01:19.174 --> 00:01:23.450
An entirely separate area from traditional investment management consists of

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.510
fintech firms that are investing in AI and

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.335
seek to disrupt the traditional firms altogether.

00:01:30.335 --> 00:01:33.095
Yet another way of thinking about this question

00:01:33.095 --> 00:01:36.050
is that it might become irrelevant in a few years.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.140
AI will just be an integral part of every industry,

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.565
including quant finance, and it won't be something to remark about at all.

00:01:43.565 --> 00:01:47.060
Interesting. So Thomas, what else is important to know

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.975
other than AI and machine learning if you want to be a successful quant?

00:01:50.975 --> 00:01:53.230
We can talk about quant requirements,

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.760
but one big thing to understand is that

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.600
you need to have some knowledge of finance itself.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.595
Of course, finance is a vast area,

00:02:01.595 --> 00:02:06.380
an ocean, and you aren't expected to have expertise in a lot of it.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.740
But you want to have shown a taste for swimming in that ocean in

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.710
order to get a job and then as you work,

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.230
you gain more and more domain knowledge.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.590
For example, if you're interviewing with the derivatives group,

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.500
you are expected to know a fair amount about options,

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.460
how they work, what they're sensitive to.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.900
Likewise, with a bond trading group to know basic bond math and terminologies,

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.365
such as duration, convexity, spread.

00:02:33.365 --> 00:02:35.510
This isn't too hard to do.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.510
There are books that can help you prepare for this.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.805
John Hulls book on Options,

00:02:40.805 --> 00:02:43.930
Futures and Other Derivatives is a classic.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.200
There are other such books.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.455
Do try to know the information and solve problems post in those books.

00:02:51.455 --> 00:02:56.270
There are even books discussing the kind of questions you can expect in quant interviews.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.720
You can use them to get a good sense of what to expect.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.300
Great. Thank you. So Thomas,

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.800
is there a trade off between

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.125
complex black-box models and the simple but explainable linear models?

00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:12.695
Some of the main differences between typical applications of

00:03:12.695 --> 00:03:17.014
AI or machine learning in the tech space versus investments,

00:03:17.014 --> 00:03:22.270
is that the signal to noise ratio is much lower in asset pricing forecasting.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.520
The data is highly non-stationary and

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.240
the sample size available is small, relatively speaking.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.014
Plus, when you act on the forecasts,

00:03:32.014 --> 00:03:36.905
that in turn impacts prices and changes the dynamics of what you are predicting,

00:03:36.905 --> 00:03:38.585
at least to some extent,

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:41.000
depending on the size of your trades.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.970
Adding to this uncertainty in forecast is

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.435
the fact that in the case of large-scale asset management,

00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:51.340
significant things like pensions are at stake.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.080
For these reasons, a majority of investors prefer interpretable models for investing,

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.630
so that they can know for themselves and explain to

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.245
their clients the reasons behind any under performance,

00:04:03.245 --> 00:04:06.005
resulting from the use of a given model.

00:04:06.005 --> 00:04:08.870
In the news, you can encounter firms talking about

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.230
how they might have had a better performing black-box model,

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.500
but prefer to use the more readily interpretable one.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.375
There are exceptions to this.

00:04:17.375 --> 00:04:20.750
There are some investors who are willing to risk the black box nature of

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.800
the model in order to get access to new or different forecasts,

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.485
and so invest in pure AI based strategies with

00:04:27.485 --> 00:04:33.425
exceptional performance or very high Sharpe ratio high frequency algorithms.

00:04:33.425 --> 00:04:39.515
This debate exists in other areas also and it depends very much on applications.

00:04:39.515 --> 00:04:43.925
Many had taken the position that interpretability is not the important thing,

00:04:43.925 --> 00:04:47.945
performance is and this debate has existed for a long time.

00:04:47.945 --> 00:04:52.030
You can see this discussed as a well-developed debate even, for example,

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:58.205
back in 2001 in Breiman's discussion of the two cultures in statistical modeling.

00:04:58.205 --> 00:05:00.040
In recent times too,

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.720
some have argued that in some applications,

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.465
like serving ads on a social media platform,

00:05:05.465 --> 00:05:09.440
people may not really need to know or even want to understand

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.300
all about the inner workings of the models as long as performance is good.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.345
Others have pushed back with examples in medical fields

00:05:17.345 --> 00:05:20.360
or elsewhere where causality is important,

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.300
that interpretability is important.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.520
Even within a single field really,

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.355
it comes down to the particular application.

00:05:28.355 --> 00:05:32.070
Great. Thanks so much for sharing your insights.
