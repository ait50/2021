00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.209
The answer for the new mean is just the one in the middle,

00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:05.794
and the reason is both weights over here are equivalent.

00:00:05.794 --> 00:00:10.419
So, we can take the mean between MU and NU, which is 11.

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:14.849
Then the sigma square is two.

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.280
If you take one over four plus one over four,

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.755
then we get one over two.

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:24.649
So, one over one over two equals two,

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:30.279
which means the new variance term is half the size of the previous variance terms.
