00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.870
The answer is over here in the middle,

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.009
it's between the two old means,

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:07.660
the mean of the prior,

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.675
and the mean of the measurement.

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:14.070
It's slightly further on the measurement side because the measurement was

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.780
more certain as to where the vehicle is than the prior.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.660
The more certain we are,

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.199
the more we pull the mean on the direction of the certain answer.
