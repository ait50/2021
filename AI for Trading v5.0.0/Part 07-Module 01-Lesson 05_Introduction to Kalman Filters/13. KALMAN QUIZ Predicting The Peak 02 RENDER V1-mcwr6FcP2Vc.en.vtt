00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.205
And very surprisingly, the resulting Gaussian

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:09.464
is more certain than the two-component Gaussians.

00:00:09.464 --> 00:00:15.434
That is the covariance is smaller than either of the two covariances in the installation.

00:00:15.435 --> 00:00:20.100
Intuitively speaking, this is the case because we actually gain information.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.545
The two Gaussians together with high information content in either Gaussian installation.

00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:27.840
So it look like something like this.

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:31.004
And it is completely non-obvious.

00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:33.390
You might have to take this with faith,

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.799
but I can actually prove it to you.
