Starting with the following source code,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I'm looking for a completion of this one line over here that returns the Gaussian function

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
with arguments mu = 10, sigma2 = 4, and x = 8,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and I want the output to be approximately 0.12.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Here's my solution. This is the constant: 1/sprt(2pisigma2).

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Then I multiply with the exponential of (-.5(x-mu)*2/sigma2).

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Applying that to the following numbers over here gives me 0.12.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Now, here's a question for you.

00:00:45.000 --> 99:59:59.999
How do I have to modify x the 8 to get the maximum return value for this function f?
