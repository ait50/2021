00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.495
So, let's step a step back and look at what we've achieved.

00:00:03.495 --> 00:00:06.040
We knew there was a measurement update,

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.945
an emotion update, which is also called prediction.

00:00:10.945 --> 00:00:13.500
We know that the measurement update is implemented by

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.344
multiplication which is the same as Bayes rule.

00:00:16.344 --> 00:00:22.640
The motion update is done by total probability or an addition.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.750
So, we tackle the more complicated case,

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.039
this is actually the hop from mathematically,

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.609
and we solve this, we give an exact expression.

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:32.835
We even derived mathematically,

00:00:32.835 --> 00:00:34.469
and you were able to write

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.494
a computer program that implements this step of the Kalman Filter.

00:00:37.494 --> 00:00:39.814
I don't want to go into too much depth here.

00:00:39.814 --> 00:00:42.049
This is a really, really easy step.

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:43.809
Let me write it down for you.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.435
Suppose you live in a world like this,

00:00:46.435 --> 00:00:50.995
this is your current best estimate of where you are and this is your uncertainty.

00:00:50.994 --> 00:00:53.515
Now, say you move to the right side,

00:00:53.515 --> 00:00:58.520
a certain distance, and that motion itself has its own set of uncertainty.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.090
Then you arrive at a prediction that adds the motion command to the mean,

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.100
and it has an increased uncertainty over the initial uncertainty.

00:01:08.099 --> 00:01:10.379
Intuitively, this makes sense.

00:01:10.379 --> 00:01:12.989
If you move to the right by this distance in

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:16.109
expectation you're exactly where you wish to be,

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:18.299
but you've lost information because your motion

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.554
tends to lose information as manifest by this uncertainty over here.

00:01:21.555 --> 00:01:25.040
Now, the math for this is really, really easy.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.265
A new mean, is your old mean plus the motion often called u.

00:01:30.265 --> 00:01:32.135
So, if you move over 10 meters,

00:01:32.135 --> 00:01:36.079
this will be 10 meters and you knew sigma square is

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:41.769
your old sigma square plus variance of the motion Gaussian.

00:01:41.769 --> 00:01:43.849
This is all you need to know,

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:45.314
it's just an addition,

00:01:45.314 --> 00:01:48.605
and I won't prove it to you because it's really trivial.

00:01:48.605 --> 00:01:52.285
But in summary, we have a Gaussian over here.

00:01:52.284 --> 00:01:55.609
We have a Gaussian for the motion with u as

00:01:55.609 --> 00:02:00.439
the mean and r square has its own motion uncertainty.

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:06.424
The resulting Gaussian in the prediction step just adds these two things up,

00:02:06.424 --> 00:02:12.169
mu plus u and sigma square plus r square.

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:16.009
Since it was so simple, let me quiz you,

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:18.539
we have a Gaussian before

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:24.155
the prediction step which mu equals 8 and sigma square equals 4.

00:02:24.155 --> 00:02:26.680
We then move to the right,

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.890
a total of 10 with a motion uncertainty of 6.

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:36.844
Now, describe to me the predicted Gaussian

00:02:36.844 --> 00:02:41.969
and give me the new mu and the new sigma square.
