00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
Suppose we multiply two Gaussians,

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:08.505
as in Bayes rule, a prior and a measurement probability.

00:00:08.505 --> 00:00:12.300
The prior has a mean of Mu and a variance of Sigma square,

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.185
and the measurement has a mean of Nu,

00:00:15.185 --> 00:00:17.290
and a covariance of r-square.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.200
Then, the new mean, Mu prime,

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.400
is the weighted sum of the old means.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.905
The Mu is weighted by r-square,

00:00:25.905 --> 00:00:28.995
Mu is weighted by Sigma square,

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:32.775
normalized by the sum of the weighting factors.

00:00:32.775 --> 00:00:34.845
The new variance term,

00:00:34.845 --> 00:00:40.500
I want to write Sigma square prime here for the new one after the update,

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.125
is given by this equation over here.

00:00:45.125 --> 00:00:47.595
So, let's put this into action.

00:00:47.595 --> 00:00:49.840
We have a weighted mean over here.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.250
Clearly, the prior Gaussian has a much higher uncertainty therefore

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.550
Sigma square is larger and that means the nu is weighted much much larger than the Mu.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.635
So, the mean will be closer to the nu than the mu,

00:01:04.635 --> 00:01:07.130
which means it will be somewhere over here.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.825
Interestingly enough, the variance term is unaffected by the actual means,

00:01:11.825 --> 00:01:13.875
it just uses the previous variances.

00:01:13.875 --> 00:01:17.240
It comes up with a new one that's even peak here,

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.435
so the result might look like this.

00:01:20.435 --> 00:01:25.915
So, this is the common situation for the measurement update step where this is the prior,

00:01:25.915 --> 00:01:30.505
this is the measurement probability and this is the posterior.

00:01:30.505 --> 00:01:35.145
So, let's practice these equations with a simple quiz.

00:01:35.145 --> 00:01:42.350
So, here are our equations again and suppose I use the following Gaussians.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.910
These are Gaussian with equal variance, but different means.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.015
They might look as follows.

00:01:49.015 --> 00:01:54.920
Compute for me the new mean after the update and the new sigma square.
