[Thrun] Let's program this.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm giving you a skeleton code.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This is the same update function as before.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now I would like you to do the predict function,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
which takes our current estimate and its variance

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and the motion and its uncertainty

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and computes the new updated prediction: mean and variance.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So for example, if our prior is 10 and 4, our motion is 12 and 4,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.468
I would like to get out to 22 and 8 according to the formulas I've just given you.
