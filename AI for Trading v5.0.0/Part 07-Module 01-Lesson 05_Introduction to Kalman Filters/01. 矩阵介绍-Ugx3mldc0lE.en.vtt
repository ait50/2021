00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.485
In this next unit,

00:00:01.485 --> 00:00:03.690
I really want to take you to a world of

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.005
amazing tools that we use to build self-driving cars.

00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:09.998
And these tools are called matrices,

00:00:09.997 --> 00:00:12.285
linear algebra or vectors.

00:00:12.285 --> 00:00:14.820
And they might look a bit scary at first,

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.754
but they're very, very intuitive.

00:00:16.754 --> 00:00:20.250
In my experience, many students struggle with those tools.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.699
So my team has put together hopefully a very comprehensive introduction to those tools.

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:26.759
If you're familiar, you're going to breeze through it.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.715
But hopefully you'll learn and demystify

00:00:29.714 --> 00:00:34.734
all these cryptic things that you find in Wikipedia when you google Kalman filters.

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:38.000
So join us and learn about matrices.
