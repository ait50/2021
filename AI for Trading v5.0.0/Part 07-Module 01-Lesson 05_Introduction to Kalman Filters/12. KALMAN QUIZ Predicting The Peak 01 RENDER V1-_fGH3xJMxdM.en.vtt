00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.470
Now, here's a question that's really, really hard.

00:00:04.469 --> 00:00:07.214
When we graph the new Gaussian.

00:00:07.214 --> 00:00:10.539
Graph one is very wide.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.460
It's very peaky.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.730
So if I were to measure where the peak of the new Gaussian is,

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.504
this will be a very narrow and skinny Gaussian.

00:00:21.504 --> 00:00:25.035
This would be one that was width is in between the two Gaussian,

00:00:25.035 --> 00:00:29.004
and this is one is even wider than the two original Gaussians.

00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:33.189
Which one do you believe is the correct posterior after multiplying these two Gaussians?

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:35.314
This is an insanely hard question,

00:00:35.314 --> 00:00:37.599
I'd like you to take your chances here,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.670
and explain me the answer in just a second.
