00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.889
In Kalman filters, we iterate measurement and motion

00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:09.480
is often called the measurement update and it's often called prediction.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.150
And the update will use Bayes rule,

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.850
which is nothing else but a product or a multiplication.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:27.400
In this update, we use total probability which is a convolution or simply an addition.

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:35.460
Let's talk first about the measurement cycle and then the prediction cycle using

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:43.799
our great Gaussians for implementing those steps.

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:46.259
Suppose you're localizing another vehicle

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:49.460
and you have a prior distribution that looks as follows;

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.990
it is a very wide Gaussian with the mean over here.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.990
And now say we get a measurement that tells us

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.350
something about the localization vehicle and it comes in like

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.320
this: it has a mean over here

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:10.704
called mu and this example has a much smaller covariance for the measurement.

00:01:10.704 --> 00:01:14.500
This is an example in our prior we were fairly uncertain about

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.109
location but the measurement told us quite a bit as to where the vehicle is.

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:24.040
Here's a quiz for you with the new mean of

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:31.490
the subsequent Gaussian B over here,

00:01:31.489 --> 00:01:35.879
over here, or over here.
