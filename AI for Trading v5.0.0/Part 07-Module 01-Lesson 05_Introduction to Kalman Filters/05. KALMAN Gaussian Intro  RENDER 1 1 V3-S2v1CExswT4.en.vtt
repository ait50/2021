00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.194
You remember our Markov model,

00:00:03.194 --> 00:00:06.334
where the word was divided into discrete grids,

00:00:06.334 --> 00:00:09.195
and we assigned to each grid to the probability.

00:00:09.195 --> 00:00:14.285
Such a representation of probability of a space is called a histogram,

00:00:14.285 --> 00:00:19.269
and that it divides the continuous space into discrete,

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.234
into finally many grid cells,

00:00:21.234 --> 00:00:23.730
and approximates the posterior distribution

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.885
by a histogram over the original distribution,

00:00:26.885 --> 00:00:31.140
and the histogram is a mere approximation to this continuous distribution.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.115
In Kalman Filters, the distribution is given by what's called a Gaussian.

00:00:36.115 --> 00:00:39.329
Gaussian is a continuous function over the space of

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.250
locations and the area underneath sums up to 1.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.545
So, use Gaussian again and if you call the space x,

00:00:50.545 --> 00:00:55.380
then the Gaussian is characterized by two parameters, the mean,

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.719
often abbreviated with the Greek letter Mu,

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:01.070
and the width of the Gaussian,

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.969
often called the variance.

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.969
For reasons I don't wanna go into is often written as a quadratic variable, Sigma square.

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:12.840
So, any Gaussian in 1D,

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.870
which means the parameter space over here is one-dimensional,

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.780
is characterized by Mu and Sigma square.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.640
So, rather than estimating the entire distribution as a histogram,

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.105
our task in common phases is to maintain a Mu and a Sigma square

00:01:28.105 --> 00:01:33.655
as our best estimate of the location of the object we are trying to find.

00:01:33.655 --> 00:01:38.250
The exact formula is an exponential of

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.230
a quadratic function where we take the exponent of this complicated expression over here.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.320
The quadratic difference of our query point x,

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:50.399
relative to the mean Mu,

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.755
divided by Sigma square,

00:01:52.754 --> 00:01:55.034
multiply by minus a half.

00:01:55.034 --> 00:01:57.929
Now if x equals Mu,

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.635
then the numerator becomes 0,

00:02:00.635 --> 00:02:04.204
and if x of 0, which is one.

00:02:04.204 --> 00:02:08.284
It turns out we have to normalize this by a constant,

00:02:08.284 --> 00:02:11.625
1 over the square root of 2 Pi Sigma square.

00:02:11.625 --> 00:02:14.175
But for everything we talk about today,

00:02:14.175 --> 00:02:16.560
this constant won't matter, so we can ignore it.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.814
What matters is we have an exponential of a quadratic function over here.

00:02:20.814 --> 00:02:24.085
So, let me draw you a couple of functions

00:02:24.085 --> 00:02:28.599
and you tell me which one you believe are Gaussian.
