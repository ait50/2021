00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Welcome to my second class on Kalman filters.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I want to take you on a little tour to where it all began--Stanford University.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Behind me is Vale, Stanford's Research Center.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Let's go inside.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This is Junior, Standord's most recent self-driving car.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It's the child of Stanley, whom you can find

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
in the National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Let me tell you something about the equipment that's on this car that makes it self-driving.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
This rotating thing over here is a laser-range finder

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that takes distance scans 10 times a second, about a million data points.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It'll be really important for the Kalman filter class I'm teaching you today.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It's major function is to spot other cars so you don't run into them.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
There is also a camera on top. There is a stereo camera system over here.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
In the rear there are antennas for a GPS--global positioning system--

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
that allows us to estimate where the car is in the world.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
This is a supplemental system to the localization class I just taught you.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This is the data that comes from the laser.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
This is the car parked in the garage right now. We see the back wall.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
These are all range measurements that tell you how far things are away,

00:01:07.000 --> 99:59:59.999
and they are essential as the input to the Kalman filter that we're going to learn about today.
