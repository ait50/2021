00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The answer is assess with the same value as mu,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
in which case this expression over here becomes zero, and we get the maximum.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We get the peak of the Gaussian.

00:00:10.000 --> 09:59:59.000
We set x to the same value as mu, to 10, and the output is 0.2 approximately.
