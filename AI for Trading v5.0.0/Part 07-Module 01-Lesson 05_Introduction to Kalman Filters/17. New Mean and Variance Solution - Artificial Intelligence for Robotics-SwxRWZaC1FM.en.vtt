00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Here's my answer. This is the expression for the mean.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is the one for the variance.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I run it, and I get the exact same answer.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I run it again for my other example of equal variances and 10 and 12 as means,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and miraculously, the correct answer comes out--

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
11 for the new mean and 2 for the new variance.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
If you programmed this correctly, then congratulations.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
You've just programmed an essential update step in the Kalman filter--

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
the measurement update step.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
That's really the difficult step in Kalman filtering.

00:00:33.000 --> 09:59:59.000
The other one--the prediction step or the motion step--is much, much easier to program.
