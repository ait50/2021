00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.109
Another way to measure turnover,

00:00:02.109 --> 00:00:04.740
is called the factor rank autocorrelation.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.519
The factor rank autocorrelation is close to one,

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:11.449
when the ranking of stocks doesn't change much from day to day.

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:13.389
To give you an illustration,

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:18.240
let's imagine our universe consists of just two stocks, apple and alphabet.

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:20.004
If over several days,

00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:21.359
the rank of apple,

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.905
based on its alpha signal is always two,

00:00:23.905 --> 00:00:26.560
and the rank of alphabet is always one,

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:29.279
then the previous ranks of each stock are

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.090
perfectly correlated with the current day's ranks.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.340
In other words, the ranks are highly

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.595
correlated or the factor rank autocorrelation is close to one.

00:00:39.594 --> 00:00:43.100
When the ranks of stocks don't change much from day to day,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.535
this also means that the weights of our theoretical portfolio don't change much either,

00:00:48.534 --> 00:00:50.625
which means less trading,

00:00:50.625 --> 00:00:53.064
and therefore less turnover.

00:00:53.064 --> 00:00:57.559
To calculate the factor rank autocorrelation for a single time period,

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.190
we'll get the ranked alpha vector for the previous day,

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:04.329
and also the ranked alpha vector for the current day.

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:07.564
Then we calculate the Spearman rank correlation

00:01:07.564 --> 00:01:11.469
between the prior days and current days ranked alpha vectors.

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:15.209
We can repeat this for multiple days and a time window,

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:19.759
so that we have a time series of factor rank autocorrelations.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:27.195
A high factor rank autocorrelation is a proxy to indicate that the turnover is lower.

00:01:27.194 --> 00:01:31.644
A low, or even negative factor rank autocorrelation,

00:01:31.644 --> 00:01:34.459
would then indicate high turnover.

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:37.474
Let's look at how we would use a turnover measure,

00:01:37.474 --> 00:01:43.484
such as factor rank autocorrelation in the context of other evaluation metrics.

00:01:43.484 --> 00:01:47.545
If two alpha factors have similar sharpe ratios,

00:01:47.545 --> 00:01:52.000
similar quintile performance, and similar factor returns,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.805
we'll always prefer the one with lower turnover.

00:01:55.805 --> 00:01:58.779
If an alpha factor has high sharpe ratio,

00:01:58.778 --> 00:02:00.840
but very high turnover,

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.230
we may need to consider whether the alpha factor would survive backtesting,

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.200
paper trading, and real trading.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.840
As a reminder of why lower turnover helps us,

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.170
it makes it more possible for us to execute trades if

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:18.369
the stocks are liquid and can reduce our transaction costs.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.770
Managing turnover is a delicate balance.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.300
On one hand, we want high turnover because that

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.070
means alpha factor is taking advantage of new information,

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.689
and making more trades which likely implies higher breath.

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:35.750
However, on the other hand,

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.580
trading costs money and

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.935
excessive turnover could mean the alpha is simply capturing noise.

00:02:41.935 --> 00:02:45.280
Over time, the more you work in alpha research,

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.789
the more you will develop intuition about this.

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:52.864
Evaluating alpha factors is both an art and a science.

00:02:52.865 --> 00:02:58.135
Keep in mind that factor rank autocorrelation is different than rank IC.

00:02:58.134 --> 00:03:02.194
Even though these metrics both use ranking and correlation,

00:03:02.194 --> 00:03:07.754
rank IC is measuring whether an alpha factor is correlated with forward returns,

00:03:07.754 --> 00:03:11.030
while factor rank autocorrelation is measuring how

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.419
stable the ranked alpha vectors are from day to day.
