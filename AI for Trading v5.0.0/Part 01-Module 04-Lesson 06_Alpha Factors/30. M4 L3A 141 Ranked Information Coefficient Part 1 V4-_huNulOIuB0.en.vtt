00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
A useful evaluation metric is the rank information coefficient,

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.115
often referred to as rank IC.

00:00:08.115 --> 00:00:11.190
The rank IC tells us whether the ranks of

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:15.704
our alpha values are correlated with the ranks of the future returns.

00:00:15.705 --> 00:00:19.785
In other words, if the alpha factor suggested that we bet

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:24.625
more on stock ABC and less on stock XYZ,

00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:28.379
was the future return of ABC relatively high?

00:00:28.379 --> 00:00:32.750
Was a future return of stock XYZ relatively low?

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.509
If the future performance of the assets matched

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:40.250
the expectations that was suggested by the alpha factor,

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.174
then the information coefficient would be higher.

00:00:43.174 --> 00:00:47.039
Otherwise, it would be lower and possibly negative.

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.484
For some insight, let's first look at this without ranking.

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:57.070
Let's pretend there are just two stocks in our universe, ABC and XYZ.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.920
Stock ABC has a high positive alpha value and

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.740
XYZ has a very negative alpha value as calculated before time,

00:01:05.739 --> 00:01:09.794
t. Between time T to time T plus one,

00:01:09.795 --> 00:01:15.560
the return of stock ABC is positive and XYZ's return is negative.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.975
These alpha values appear to be correlated with the forward asset returns.

00:01:20.974 --> 00:01:24.509
Note here, when we say asset return,

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.355
we're referring to the return of each stock for each time period.

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:34.210
We also specify that the asset return is a forward return.

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:39.109
We say, forward asset return to specify that the return is in

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:45.105
the future or forward in time compared to when the alpha value was calculated.

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:49.320
So, if the alpha values are calculated before time t,

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:52.609
then the forward asset return is calculated with data that

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:57.150
occurs later from time t to time t plus one.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.980
To make our evaluation more robust,

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.545
we want to use ranks instead of the original alpha values and returns.

00:02:04.545 --> 00:02:09.664
Stock ABC is alpha value before time t is high and positive,

00:02:09.664 --> 00:02:13.060
while stock XYZ is alpha value, is negative.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:20.275
So, ABC has a higher rank of two and XYZ has a lower rank of one.

00:02:20.275 --> 00:02:28.384
The forward asset return of ABC from time t to time t plus one is higher compared to XYZ.

00:02:28.384 --> 00:02:32.500
So, the rank of ABC's forward asset return is two,

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.280
and the rank of XYZ's forward asset return is one.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.370
If the ranks of the alpha values and the ranks

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.525
of the forward asset returns are highly correlated,

00:02:43.525 --> 00:02:47.210
the rank IC metric would be close to one.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.520
In this example, since the ranks of

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.054
the two alpha values are equal to the ranks of the two forward asset returns,

00:02:54.054 --> 00:02:57.930
then the rank IC in this example is one.
