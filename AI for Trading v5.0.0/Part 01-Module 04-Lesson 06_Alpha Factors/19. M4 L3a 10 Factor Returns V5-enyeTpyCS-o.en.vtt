00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.035
Once we've calculated an Alpha factor,

00:00:03.035 --> 00:00:05.880
we can calculate some evaluation metrics,

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.359
that let us compare it to other Alpha factors and get a sense for how it

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:13.425
might perform when used to design a real-world portfolio.

00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:15.765
These metrics include factor returns,

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:18.380
sharpe ratio, information coefficient,

00:00:18.379 --> 00:00:23.369
information ratio, quantile analysis, and turnover analysis.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.880
We evaluate Alpha factors to help us decide whether we'll

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:30.259
use them in creating a combined Alpha factor,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.484
which we'll then use within portfolio optimization.

00:00:33.484 --> 00:00:37.359
One useful construct, is the return of the factor,

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:39.435
which is called the factor return.

00:00:39.435 --> 00:00:44.060
The idea is that this is the return that a theoretical portfolio

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.310
designed to capitalize on the arbitrage idea presented by the factor would produce.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.570
You can think of this as a way to directly measure the returns

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.969
your portfolio would have if their weights were determined purely by the Alpha factor.

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.715
To calculate the factor return we create a theoretical portfolio in which the weights for

00:01:04.715 --> 00:01:10.790
each stock on each day are set equal to the Alpha value for each stock on that day.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.550
So, every day we use the prior day's known data to calculate an Alpha vector,

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.444
which we would standardize to have mean zero,

00:01:19.444 --> 00:01:22.969
and the sum of absolute values equal to one.

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:26.584
We use the Alpha value of each stock i,

00:01:26.584 --> 00:01:29.890
as the weight for that stock on the current day

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.109
T. At the end of that day we check the returns of each stock i,

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:39.254
for that day T, which we'll call the single day return.

00:01:39.254 --> 00:01:43.519
Then, we can calculate the weighted average of the returns,

00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:45.829
using the Alpha values as weights.

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.399
This gives us the factor return for a single day.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.310
We can repeat this for multiple days for a window of a year or more.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.855
This time series of daily portfolio returns is the factor return.

00:01:59.855 --> 00:02:03.790
Note that we'll use historical data to calculate the factor return.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.520
So, the example of calculating this one day at a time,

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:12.139
is to help you see that we're simulating daily portfolio decisions that are

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:16.849
only based on information that existed at the time of the theoretical trade,

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.509
and these portfolio decisions are refreshed every day.

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:23.419
Notice that the factor return depends upon

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:28.125
the stock universe and time window of our theoretical portfolio,

00:02:28.125 --> 00:02:32.000
but it's a useful way to compare various Alpha factors to each

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.800
other if we choose the same universe and time window.
