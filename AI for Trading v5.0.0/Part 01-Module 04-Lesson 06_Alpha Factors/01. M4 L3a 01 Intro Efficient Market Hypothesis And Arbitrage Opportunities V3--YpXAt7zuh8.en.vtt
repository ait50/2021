00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Welcome to the overview of alpha factors.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.929
This is the extra exciting part where you finally get to start

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:11.714
turning hypotheses into code and testing that code against data.

00:00:11.714 --> 00:00:15.960
Alpha factors are tools operating on data that give us

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.679
signals about how stocks may perform relative to one another.

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:26.458
You've heard a little about alpha factors already and how they differ from risk factors.

00:00:26.458 --> 00:00:32.384
Remember that alpha factors are hopefully predictive of future mean returns,

00:00:32.384 --> 00:00:38.659
while risk factors impart information about commonality of return variance.

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:41.929
The search for alpha factors is essentially

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:45.799
the search for deviations from the efficient market hypothesis.

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:49.039
The efficient market hypothesis has different forms,

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:50.585
but generally it means that

00:00:50.585 --> 00:00:54.410
all available information is reflected in the current price of an asset,

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:57.109
which suggests that assets are priced fairly.

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.905
When searching for exceptions to the efficient market hypothesis,

00:01:00.905 --> 00:01:03.795
we're looking for mispricing in the market.

00:01:03.795 --> 00:01:06.375
We learned about arbitrage before,

00:01:06.375 --> 00:01:11.135
which is the simultaneous buying and selling of a perfect substitute to make a profit.

00:01:11.135 --> 00:01:13.635
In the context of this lesson,

00:01:13.635 --> 00:01:16.340
we'll also use the term arbitrage.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.945
But here, it refers to buying an asset that may be

00:01:19.944 --> 00:01:23.854
underpriced or shorting one that may be overpriced,

00:01:23.855 --> 00:01:30.185
where the expected return is in excess of what it should be for the risk we bear.

00:01:30.185 --> 00:01:33.034
In this lesson, we'll start by discussing

00:01:33.034 --> 00:01:38.689
academic research as a source for hypotheses and for alpha factor generation.

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:44.295
We'll cover techniques for processing a raw alpha factor including methods,

00:01:44.295 --> 00:01:47.280
such as sector neutralization, ranking,

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.564
Z-scoring, smoothing, and conditioning factors on other factors.

00:01:52.564 --> 00:01:55.640
Each of these techniques is important in

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.090
the process of turning the numbers in our alpha vectors into

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:06.040
signals that represent whether to buy or short each stock in a portfolio and by how much.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.110
That is to say, these techniques are relevant to

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.635
the goals that we have for real-world portfolios.

00:02:12.634 --> 00:02:16.405
We'll also cover techniques for evaluating factors,

00:02:16.405 --> 00:02:18.305
such as the sharpe ratio,

00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:23.650
information coefficient, information ratio, and turnover analysis.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.849
These will help you decide whether your alphas provide enough return relative to risk,

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:35.335
and whether they will cause too much trading to likely be profitable in the real world.

00:02:35.335 --> 00:02:40.490
The topics we discuss here will prepare you for the following lesson,

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.230
in which we extract alpha factor ideas from academic research papers,

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:48.394
and then implement those ideas in code.

00:02:48.395 --> 00:02:52.820
This is exactly the type of work that quants do in the real world.

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.584
In this lesson, we step into the typical life of a quant researcher.

00:02:57.585 --> 00:03:00.860
You'll see how quants generate alpha factor ideas

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.000
that may make their way into real hedge fund portfolios.
