00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
A metric that is a special application of the Sharpe ratio is the information ratio.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.710
Recall that we are separating known factors as risk factors,

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.610
which drive the variants of stocks and Alpha factors which

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:19.399
drive portfolio returns after neutralizing to those risk factors.

00:00:19.399 --> 00:00:23.629
The return driven by risk factors is the systematic return,

00:00:23.629 --> 00:00:25.559
whereas the return driven by

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:29.844
the Alpha factors after taking out the effect of risk factors,

00:00:29.844 --> 00:00:32.725
well, this is the specific return.

00:00:32.725 --> 00:00:38.329
The specific return is also referred to as the residual return

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.390
because it is the residual amount of return that

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.079
remains after taking out the systematic return.

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:51.414
The information ratio is the Sharpe ratio applied to the specific return.

00:00:51.414 --> 00:00:58.144
So, it's the average specific return divided by its standard deviation annualized.

00:00:58.145 --> 00:01:02.720
The information ratio can be interpreted as the Sharpe ratio that

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.855
measures the performance that the fund manager contributes to the portfolio.

00:01:07.855 --> 00:01:12.500
Note that in the context of what we're doing in this lesson,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.909
that is Alpha modeling,

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.229
we are creating a market and common factor neutral portfolio.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.939
Note that in this case,

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.444
the Sharpe ratio equals the information ratio.

00:01:26.444 --> 00:01:29.659
We simply introduced the term information ratio

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.704
here because you will see it often in academic literature.

00:01:33.704 --> 00:01:35.750
As I stated previously,

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.230
the most important metric in evaluating an Alpha factor and

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.000
ultimately a trading strategy or fund is the Sharpe ratio.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.590
So, some good advice might be, okay,

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.725
just create Alpha strategies with high Sharpe ratios.

00:01:48.724 --> 00:01:54.614
That advice though is pretty useless because it's descriptive not proscriptive.

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:57.920
In other words, it tells us what we want to achieve,

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.390
but it says nothing about how to get there.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.004
So, how do we actually create high Sharpe Ratio strategies?

00:02:05.004 --> 00:02:10.699
Well, the fundamental law of active management gives us some insight.

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:13.299
From a philosophical standpoint,

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.820
perhaps the most important thing you will learn in

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.469
this program is the following relationship;

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:25.715
IR equals IC times the square root of B.

00:02:25.715 --> 00:02:29.775
This comes from the seminal work a Richard Grinold,

00:02:29.775 --> 00:02:31.515
which is aptly titled,

00:02:31.514 --> 00:02:33.939
the Fundamental Law of Active Management.

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:38.150
This is further detailed in the subsequent book by both Richard Grinold

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.250
and Ronald Khan titled, Active Portfolio Management.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.409
By the way, this formula IR equals IC times the square root of

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:54.764
B sometimes referred to as the E equals MC squared of finance.

00:02:54.764 --> 00:02:57.179
I just want to make a point about this formula.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.439
This result is based on some simplifying assumptions and should be thought of as a guide.

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:05.210
It would be more correct to say that IR is

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.800
proportional to IC times the square root of B as opposed to equal.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.590
This is not a formula we will use directly.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.800
Meaning, we don't actually use it to make calculations.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.385
Rather, we use this identity to direct how we structure our investment process.

00:03:21.384 --> 00:03:25.449
Also, don't worry if the relationship between IR, IC,

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:29.614
and B doesn't look obvious to you as it's not supposed to be.

00:03:29.615 --> 00:03:31.955
If you're interested in the derivation,

00:03:31.955 --> 00:03:36.395
you can check out the original paper or the book by Grinold and Kahn.

00:03:36.395 --> 00:03:39.210
I haven't defined what IR, IC,

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.170
and B mean in the context of this relationship.

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:44.799
But stay tuned, it's coming up.
