00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
Another real-world constraint is the total transaction cost,

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.085
the implicit and explicit costs of making trades.

00:00:08.085 --> 00:00:11.145
Transaction costs add up and are often

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:17.129
a substantial contributor to the success or lack of success of a trading strategy.

00:00:17.129 --> 00:00:19.969
Most people immediately think of commissions,

00:00:19.969 --> 00:00:23.059
the explicit cost, as the transaction cost.

00:00:23.059 --> 00:00:26.004
However, for an institutional market participant,

00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:32.089
the commission is usually by far the smallest component of the true transaction cost.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.540
The biggest component, the implicit component,

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:37.844
is what is called the market impact.

00:00:37.844 --> 00:00:40.979
Institutions need to make large trades.

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:43.429
Market impact is the effect that

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:46.829
a market participant has when he or she buys or sells an asset.

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.170
It is the extent to which buying or selling moves the price against the buyer or seller.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.969
More buying will move the market price upward.

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.629
More selling will move the market price downward.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:06.159
For instance, if a fund is trying to sell a large block of shares to an investment bank,

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.420
then the larger the block of shares,

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.390
the more risk the investment bank is taking in holding the opposite side of the trade.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.939
So, the investment bank would ask for a better deal in the form of a lower price,

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.984
which would then diminish the profit of the fund.

00:01:20.984 --> 00:01:24.170
To avoid adversely moving the market price,

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.409
they will likely slice the trade into smaller blocks.

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.284
Then we'll trade those blocks over time.

00:01:30.284 --> 00:01:34.114
Taking more time to trade all blocks also entails the risk

00:01:34.114 --> 00:01:37.670
that the market price will move over that time.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.965
So to summarize,

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:43.400
real-world transaction costs can diminish the performance of an alpha factor.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.310
So, we want some way to evaluate

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.400
an alpha factors potential impact on a portfolio's total transaction cost.
