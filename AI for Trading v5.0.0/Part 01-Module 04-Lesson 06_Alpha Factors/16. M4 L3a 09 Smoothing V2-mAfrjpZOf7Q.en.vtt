00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.355
Financial data is noisy,

00:00:02.355 --> 00:00:05.535
and sometimes the data we're working with is sparse.

00:00:05.535 --> 00:00:08.664
For instance, it might have many missing values.

00:00:08.664 --> 00:00:11.309
We can apply smoothing techniques across

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:16.870
the time dimension to help make the factor more robust to noise and sparse data.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.539
Fundamental data is also sparse in nature,

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:21.869
since it is only updated in the US,

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.325
for example, once every three months.

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:26.609
If we wish to use in a higher frequency,

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.344
such as daily frequency,

00:00:28.344 --> 00:00:30.750
we should copy the most recent data over to

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.359
each new day until the next new data point arrives three months later.

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:39.269
We could also apply smoothing so that the daily data points

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.150
incorporate some weighted averaging of not only the most recent update,

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.795
but also the value from previous quarters.

00:00:46.795 --> 00:00:50.929
To make our Alpha factor more robust to noise and sparse data,

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:53.604
we can apply a rolling window average.

00:00:53.604 --> 00:00:56.625
A rolling window is a kind of smoothing technique.

00:00:56.625 --> 00:01:00.604
A variation of a rolling window average is a weighted average,

00:01:00.604 --> 00:01:03.679
where the most recent Alpha may be given more weight

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:07.590
and prior Alpha values are included but given less weight.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.755
This is called linear decay.

00:01:09.754 --> 00:01:13.459
For example, if we choose a window length of two and took

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:18.833
the weighted average of the most recent Alpha values and the prior days Alpha values,

00:01:18.834 --> 00:01:24.200
we could give the newest value a weight of two and the earlier value a weight of one.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.510
In general, for a window length of T,

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.219
we would give the most recent Alpha value a weight of

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:33.323
T. Then for the earlier alpha values,

00:01:33.323 --> 00:01:35.329
we'd give them smaller weights.

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.379
This technique can be very effective.

00:01:38.379 --> 00:01:42.140
In fact, I've seen several cases where the application of

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.730
a smoothing operator both increase the Sharpe ratio and decrease the turnover.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.299
By the way, we'll cover the Sharpe ratio and

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:53.119
a proxy for measuring turnover later in this lesson.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.840
These are both important evaluation metrics that help us find out if

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.530
an Alpha factor that we create has the potential to enhance a portfolio's performance.
