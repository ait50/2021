00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.134
Let's talk about the structure.

00:00:02.134 --> 00:00:06.189
Do you remember grade school science fairs and learning about the scientific method?

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.385
Well guess what, what you learned actually applies to the real world.

00:00:10.384 --> 00:00:14.004
Papers are actually structured with title, abstract,

00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:18.050
methods, results, conclusions, and discussion sections.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.025
Let's start at the beginning.

00:00:20.024 --> 00:00:23.429
The very first thing that you'll read is the paper's title.

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.265
You've probably picked out the paper because the title

00:00:26.265 --> 00:00:29.320
indicates that the topic has to do with something you care about.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.060
Sometimes, it has an important keyword.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.890
The second thing that you should pay attention to is

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.890
the list of authors. Why does this matter?

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.094
Well, it tells you something about the provenance of the ideas within.

00:00:42.094 --> 00:00:44.894
Usually, the first author is the main author,

00:00:44.895 --> 00:00:46.590
the person who did most of the work.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.695
But sometimes there are multiple main authors, indicated with asterisks.

00:00:50.695 --> 00:00:53.780
Usually, the last author is this person's adviser.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.524
Typically, a more senior person in the field.

00:00:56.524 --> 00:01:01.399
The ideas in the paper maybe offshoots of this more senior person's other ideas.

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.664
So, they may be related to this person's older papers.

00:01:04.665 --> 00:01:06.890
When there are only one or two authors,

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.575
it could be that this person or people are already

00:01:09.575 --> 00:01:13.390
established in this field and they worked on this project on their own.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.799
Sometimes the list of authors is huge.

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.500
This means that many teams of people typically in

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.974
different places around the world had to cooperate to accomplish this work.

00:01:22.974 --> 00:01:26.634
Okay. The third thing you'll read is the abstract.

00:01:26.635 --> 00:01:28.940
This is a short summary of the paper.

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.484
Sometimes this is as far as you get.

00:01:31.484 --> 00:01:34.034
The abstract should communicate basically

00:01:34.034 --> 00:01:37.045
the question or problem the author tried to address,

00:01:37.045 --> 00:01:40.034
what the author did, the main important finding,

00:01:40.034 --> 00:01:42.239
and what they think their result means.

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:46.604
That is how it addresses the original question or problem.

00:01:46.605 --> 00:01:49.460
If you read the abstract and the paper is

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:51.859
about something different than what you thought it was,

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:54.510
or doesn't indicate that they found something meaningful,

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.565
you can stop right there.

00:01:56.564 --> 00:01:59.554
Sometimes the abstract looks interesting,

00:01:59.555 --> 00:02:01.945
but doesn't give you enough information.

00:02:01.944 --> 00:02:03.744
If you get past the abstract,

00:02:03.745 --> 00:02:05.555
you come to the introduction.

00:02:05.555 --> 00:02:10.010
In this part, the author is supposed to give some background about the field,

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.655
and explain why they decided to study the topic of the paper.

00:02:13.655 --> 00:02:18.210
It's supposed to help you follow the flow of ideas that led to the question,

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.500
which in turn led to the idea of their paper.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.110
Sometimes the author does a great job at this,

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.990
and you can really learn something about the field in this part.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.680
Sometimes the introduction is short and not very helpful.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.325
Often, in this section,

00:02:32.324 --> 00:02:36.409
the paper will cite other papers that may be useful to look at to.

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:39.710
The next section is usually the methods section.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.710
Do you have to go through this line by line?

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.575
No. In fact, you can skip this entire section.

00:02:46.574 --> 00:02:49.459
You might skip ahead to the results and conclusions to

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.865
know what they actually found and come back to this section later.

00:02:52.865 --> 00:02:54.390
You might end up reading this,

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:58.489
if you want to know that they were careful to control for some important confounding

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.705
variable which you would care about if you were trying to decide for yourself,

00:03:02.705 --> 00:03:04.545
if their results are meaningful.

00:03:04.544 --> 00:03:09.989
Or you might read this, if you want to replicate what they did in whole or in part.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.330
Next, is usually the result section.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.260
This section should communicate the main measurements the authors made.

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:20.560
Ideally, everything is well labeled and clear.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.830
But sometimes it's not,

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.230
and you have to skip back to the methods to find out what some measurement is.

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:32.144
Finally, the conclusions or discussion should communicate why the results are important,

00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:36.880
what they mean, and how they relate to the original question or problem.
