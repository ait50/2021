00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390
Congratulations on making it through this lesson.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:09.029
We reviewed some foundational building blocks that you will see again and use when we

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:15.064
translate academic papers into alpha ideas and then implement those ideas in code.

00:00:15.064 --> 00:00:18.699
But let's just remember that, even after testing,

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:20.574
if your alphas look promising,

00:00:20.574 --> 00:00:25.515
this is really only the first stage of their lives so to speak.

00:00:25.515 --> 00:00:29.144
Lets step back a bit and see how the search for alpha factors

00:00:29.144 --> 00:00:33.619
fits into the big picture of the quant workflow.

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:37.134
We first propose and generate alpha factors,

00:00:37.134 --> 00:00:42.195
then evaluate them to find those that might show some promise.

00:00:42.195 --> 00:00:46.390
Then we perform out-of-sample testing of

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:52.689
the alpha factors using historical data that wasn't used to construct the alpha vector.

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:54.934
If that looks promising,

00:00:54.935 --> 00:00:59.965
then we would conduct paper trading in which we don't use real money,

00:00:59.965 --> 00:01:03.610
but we follow the factor as if we're making theoretical trays over

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:08.295
time on newly arriving live market data for some period.

00:01:08.295 --> 00:01:10.575
If that showed promise,

00:01:10.575 --> 00:01:16.004
then we would put the alpha into production in a real portfolio with real money.

00:01:16.004 --> 00:01:19.179
The alpha at that stage would be blended with

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.595
other alphas and the final alpha vector would pass through a portfolio optimizer.

00:01:24.594 --> 00:01:30.504
We would likely start by giving that alpha factor a small weight in the combined vector,

00:01:30.504 --> 00:01:35.949
and given more weight if it performed and improved portfolio performance.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.680
We would monitor the alpha factor over time knowing that at some point,

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.545
the factor's usefulness will erode because we're trading in a competitive market.

00:01:45.545 --> 00:01:49.510
Then, we would remove the alpha factor and go back to

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.840
the beginning to search for new promising alpha factors.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.370
Note that when I say "we" in those steps,

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.835
after the first one,

00:01:58.834 --> 00:02:02.529
the "we" could be a human portfolio manager or it

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.924
could be an artificially intelligent agent and AI.

00:02:06.924 --> 00:02:08.844
Even in the first step,

00:02:08.844 --> 00:02:14.705
we can utilize AI techniques to help us recover both these AI applications.

00:02:14.705 --> 00:02:18.740
The application for alpha generation and the AI application for

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.945
portfolio construction in term two of the API for trading nano degree program.

00:02:23.944 --> 00:02:28.750
We will cover later stages of this process in future lessons.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.099
We will cover backtesting,

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.840
out-of-sample testing and other methods to avoid overfitting.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.905
It can't be overstated how important out-of-sample testing is in practice.

00:02:41.905 --> 00:02:45.634
If our goal is to seek above average performance

00:02:45.634 --> 00:02:50.049
in real production trading with real money and real world constraints,

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.615
then it is critically important to avoid overfitting to pass

00:02:53.615 --> 00:02:59.270
data to the point that our alpha factors cannot generalize to current market conditions.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.320
Even within the academic scientific community,

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.579
both in finance and in the general sciences,

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.844
there are serious discussions about

00:03:09.844 --> 00:03:14.585
overfitting and about validating the results of research.

00:03:14.585 --> 00:03:19.295
The rest of this lesson will focus on generating and evaluating alpha factors.

00:03:19.294 --> 00:03:23.209
But I do hope you keep in mind that it's perfectly normal if

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.165
you feel the need to go back and review the concepts covered in this lesson.

00:03:27.164 --> 00:03:29.810
I know there was quite a lot of material,

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.620
but I'm also very excited for you as you're learning the techniques and

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.360
the type of thinking that real quant researchers deploy in their search for alpha.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.330
See you in the next lesson.
