00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.065
Note that the word alpha is used to mean different things within the world of finance.

00:00:06.065 --> 00:00:08.755
In the context of factor models,

00:00:08.755 --> 00:00:11.339
we'll refer to an alpha model as

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:16.285
an algorithm that transforms input data into a list of numbers,

00:00:16.285 --> 00:00:21.429
one number for each stock under consideration per time step.

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:27.719
A higher positive number means we want to put more money on that stock law.

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:31.734
A negative number means we want to short the stock.

00:00:31.734 --> 00:00:39.570
An alpha vector refers to this list of numbers for a single time period, such as a day.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.564
Each number in the alpha vector is proportional

00:00:43.564 --> 00:00:47.210
to the amount of money we want to allocate towards each stock,

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.375
according to the alpha model.

00:00:49.375 --> 00:00:53.755
The alpha vector at each time step is standardized,

00:00:53.755 --> 00:01:00.859
so that it has mean zero and the sum of the absolute values adds up to one.

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:07.430
We'll use the term alpha value to refer to a single number in the alpha vector.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.870
So, it's a number assigned to a single stock for a single time period, such as a day.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:19.420
We'll refer to an alpha factor as a time series of alpha vectors.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.180
So, it's the set of alpha vectors over multiple time periods,

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.115
such as multiple days.

00:01:26.114 --> 00:01:31.614
A raw alpha factor is the initial output of the alpha model,

00:01:31.614 --> 00:01:36.839
excluding additional processing that is done to improve the alpha.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.880
We'll use the term raw alpha factor to distinguish from

00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:44.780
an alpha factor that has been processed to improve its signal,

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.015
and make it easier to work with.

00:01:47.015 --> 00:01:49.614
Note that within the finance industry,

00:01:49.614 --> 00:01:55.304
there is no single consistent way that practitioners use the term alpha or alpha factor.

00:01:55.305 --> 00:01:58.320
Though, our use is the most common.

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:01.549
We'll use these definitions to help us identify

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.054
which step in our alpha generation we're referring to.

00:02:05.055 --> 00:02:08.050
We'll also be talking about our stock universe,

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.890
or simply our universe.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:12.349
This refers to the set of stocks which

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.215
we are considering in our portfolio at each time step.

00:02:15.215 --> 00:02:20.680
These are stocks that we may or may not hold positions in for our portfolio.
