00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.873
Recall that we prefer to control for risk within the Alpha factors,

00:00:04.873 --> 00:00:10.355
rather than waiting for their risk model optimizer to do it completely for us.

00:00:10.355 --> 00:00:16.324
This is why we make the Alpha vector dollar neutral and often also sector neutral.

00:00:16.324 --> 00:00:20.070
The reason we wish to control for risk early on within

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.410
the Alpha vector itself is so that after the optimization,

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.675
the portfolio weights are not too different from the original Alpha vector.

00:00:28.675 --> 00:00:31.650
It's natural for you to wonder why is it an issue

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:34.850
at the portfolio weights are nothing like the original Alpha vector?

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.804
To understand this, remember that we're evaluating

00:00:38.804 --> 00:00:43.899
each Alpha factor in isolation of other Alpha vectors.

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:46.789
We evaluate the Alpha factor to see if it may be

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:50.579
a good candidate to help improve the performance of a portfolio.

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.210
If after optimization, the risk model significantly changes

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.820
the weights for stock so that they no

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.299
longer follow the weights chosen by the Alpha vector,

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:07.789
then we can't expect the performance of the Alpha to carry over into the portfolio.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:15.405
As the example, imagine if an Alpha vector gives most positive weight to stock ABC.

00:01:15.405 --> 00:01:19.430
But after the risk model neutralizes various common risks,

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.345
the final portfolio weights end up shorting stock ABC,

00:01:23.344 --> 00:01:26.599
then the signal from the Alpha vector which essentially says,

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:30.339
"Buy stock ABC" is no longer being followed.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.930
This means that the performance that we originally

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.240
hoped to gain from using this Alpha vector

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:40.250
may not carry over or transfer to the portfolio itself.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.340
Remember that the Alpha vector is an expression of expected returns.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.799
If the portfolio weights after every optimization

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.119
are very different from the original Alpha factors,

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.859
then the portfolio itself may not be

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:58.655
capturing the information expressed by those Alpha vectors.

00:01:58.655 --> 00:02:04.219
To see how closely the optimized portfolio weights still match the original Alpha vector,

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.750
we can calculate something called the transfer coefficient.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.610
The transfer coefficient measures how closely

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.580
the optimized portfolio weights match the original Alpha vector.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.920
To get the transfer coefficient,

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:22.109
we need to use portfolio optimization that includes a risk factor model.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.030
We will learn about the portfolio optimization step in a later lesson.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.060
For now, let's just assume that we have

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.680
a portfolio optimizer that outputs portfolio weights.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.745
We start with our Alpha vector,

00:02:34.745 --> 00:02:39.490
pass it through the portfolio optimization and get portfolio weights.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.025
The transfer coefficient is the correlation

00:02:43.025 --> 00:02:47.235
between the Alpha vector and the resulting portfolio weights.

00:02:47.235 --> 00:02:50.540
A high transfer coefficient is a good sign that

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:55.849
the Alpha vector has survived the portfolio optimizers risk neutralization.

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.810
The transfer coefficient is also a useful measure for

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:06.300
another desired attribute of an Alpha factor independence from risk factors.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.390
Ideally, we would like to find

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:13.119
Alpha factors that are independent of the common risk factors.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.209
If Alpha factors were too correlated with the risk factors,

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.750
then they would also be neutralized by the risk model.
