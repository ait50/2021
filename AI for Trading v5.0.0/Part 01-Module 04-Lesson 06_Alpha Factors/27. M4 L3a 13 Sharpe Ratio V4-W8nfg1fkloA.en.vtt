00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
The sharpe ratio, sometimes referred to as the risk adjusted return,

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.810
is a key metric for evaluating alpha factors.

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:09.809
This is the ratio of

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.355
the daily factor return divided by the daily standard deviation of the return.

00:00:14.355 --> 00:00:18.600
As an example, if we had three years worth of daily data,

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.020
we could calculate the average daily return over those three years and

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:26.250
divide by the sample standard deviation of those daily returns,

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.070
and then analyse that by multiplying by

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.270
the square root of the number of trading days in a year.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.475
If we have two factors that have the same universe and similar turnover profiles,

00:00:37.475 --> 00:00:40.990
we will prefer the one with the higher sharpe ratio.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:46.880
Sharpe ratio is the key metric that institutional asset managers are judged on.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.575
Note that the Sharpe ratio,

00:00:48.575 --> 00:00:51.825
like many evaluation metrics for alpha factors,

00:00:51.825 --> 00:00:56.165
help us to compare the relative performance of alpha vectors.

00:00:56.164 --> 00:00:58.310
The sharpe ratio is key,

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.130
not the magnitude of factor returns.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.004
Because as we learned in the immediately preceding section,

00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:11.519
we can amplify or dampen returns by the use of leverage.

00:01:11.519 --> 00:01:17.000
It is the sharpe ratio that gives us the confidence to apply that leverage.
