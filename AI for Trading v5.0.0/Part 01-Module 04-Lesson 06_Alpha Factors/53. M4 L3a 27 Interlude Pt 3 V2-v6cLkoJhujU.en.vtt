00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.659
Another thing to remember,

00:00:01.659 --> 00:00:06.960
is that journals themselves impose their own editorial influence on papers too.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.449
They look for papers of certain types.

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:12.334
They ask for papers to be structured in certain ways.

00:00:12.335 --> 00:00:15.390
They impose word counts and style guides.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.839
Often within a field,

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:19.649
certain journals are known to be the most competitive to

00:00:19.649 --> 00:00:22.964
get your work published in and the most high profile.

00:00:22.964 --> 00:00:26.745
Typically these journals have the largest most diverse readership.

00:00:26.745 --> 00:00:29.760
So, a paper must be of sufficient importance and

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.969
broad interests to be published there and be circulated to the most eyeballs.

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.695
The other important thing I wanted to tell you is that,

00:00:38.695 --> 00:00:40.789
if what you are trying to do is understand

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:43.810
a whole field and not just an individual experiment,

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.245
or project, what you may want is a review paper.

00:00:47.244 --> 00:00:49.804
This is a paper that has a different purpose.

00:00:49.804 --> 00:00:51.335
It's meant to be a summary,

00:00:51.335 --> 00:00:53.179
or discussion of several papers,

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:55.219
or ideas on the same topic.

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.144
These are like gold for newcomers to a field.

00:00:58.145 --> 00:01:01.385
It's not always clear where and how to find them.

00:01:01.384 --> 00:01:06.634
Sometimes a journal that normally publishes regular papers puts out an issue of reviews.

00:01:06.635 --> 00:01:10.750
Other times you'll find helpful reviews and journals that only publish reviews.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.489
For example, the journal annual reviews.

00:01:13.489 --> 00:01:15.069
A final thing to know,

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:17.379
when you are reading research papers is that,

00:01:17.379 --> 00:01:22.164
yes a paper is a piece of communication or documentation about a study.

00:01:22.165 --> 00:01:25.995
But it is also an assertion that science has progressed,

00:01:25.995 --> 00:01:27.819
that knowledge has advanced,

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:30.424
in other words it's an assertion that the work

00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:34.629
documented in the study means something important about the world.

00:01:34.629 --> 00:01:37.939
When a paper is complete enough to be sent to a journal,

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.765
it usually means that many people think the work is valid and meaningful.

00:01:41.765 --> 00:01:44.844
The lead author, her colleagues, her adviser,

00:01:44.844 --> 00:01:46.370
and potentially other people in

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.880
the research community who the person showed the work to or discuss it with.

00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:54.259
But then when a journal editor takes interest in a paper,

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.760
the work is usually sent out to other people who do similar work.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.160
These people often raise very important concerns about

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.209
the validity or meaning of the work that nobody else has mentioned yet.

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:09.424
Their assertions can block publication of the paper if not addressed.

00:02:09.425 --> 00:02:12.430
This is the peer review process.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.784
Finally, even after a paper is published,

00:02:15.784 --> 00:02:20.715
sometimes information comes out that cast the information in the paper in a new light.

00:02:20.715 --> 00:02:23.569
For example, sometimes other researchers

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.574
try to do the same thing and get different results.

00:02:26.574 --> 00:02:31.754
This isn't to say that you should necessarily always doubt the authors assertions,

00:02:31.754 --> 00:02:34.745
but neither should you believe them wholesale.

00:02:34.745 --> 00:02:38.009
The reality is far more nuanced than that.

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:39.929
The vast majority of the time,

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.700
they did what they say they did but there may be a caveat about how they did

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:47.905
it such that what they did is not as meaningful as they think,

00:02:47.905 --> 00:02:50.778
this is just to say that the process of establishing

00:02:50.778 --> 00:02:54.275
knowledge is long and has many twists and turns.

00:02:54.275 --> 00:02:56.129
Remember that when you read a paper,

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.120
you're somewhere in the middle of that process which is

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.180
also rather exciting because when you're reading papers,

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.550
you maybe learning about things that are so new

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.880
that very few people in the world have heard of them yet.

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.189
Getting back to the actual reading,

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:13.514
sometimes it is important that you read an entire paper.

00:03:13.514 --> 00:03:15.979
For example, if you're doing a presentation on it

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:18.729
and people are going to ask you detailed questions.

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:21.019
But more often there's certain information you are

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.955
looking to take from a paper and that's all you need.

00:03:23.955 --> 00:03:28.790
I think the most important thing to remember in practice is to keep up your momentum.

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:31.929
Don't get stuck on a tiny detail that you don't understand.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.730
If you think it's really important,

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:37.280
take a note and look it up elsewhere later and move on.
