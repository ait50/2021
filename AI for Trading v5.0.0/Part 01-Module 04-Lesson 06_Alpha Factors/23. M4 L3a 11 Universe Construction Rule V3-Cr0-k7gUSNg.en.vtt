00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.525
One important thing to note is that when we say "universe",

00:00:04.525 --> 00:00:07.390
we really mean Universe Construction Rule.

00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:10.289
Meaning, we cannot pick a static list of

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:14.929
stocks and just use those for all time periods historically.

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.855
If we chose a static list of stocks that exists today,

00:00:18.855 --> 00:00:21.935
or that have data for the time window of interests,

00:00:21.934 --> 00:00:25.269
that would include look-ahead bias.

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:29.039
Look-ahead bias occurs when we simulate a trade on

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.649
historical data using information that wouldn't be known at that time.

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.284
A particular kind of look-ahead bias is survivorship bias.

00:00:37.284 --> 00:00:43.894
Survivorship bias occurs when we have the benefit today of choosing stocks for the past.

00:00:43.895 --> 00:00:47.810
In order to have an unbiased sample for our stock universe,

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.170
we would not want to exclude companies that,

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.730
for example, went bankrupt or were acquired because in the past,

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:59.268
we would not know about those future events.

00:00:59.268 --> 00:01:02.210
Instead, we have to use a rule that

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.010
creates the universe as it would have been for each day.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.545
One way to do this is to use a commercial index provider

00:01:09.545 --> 00:01:13.555
and use the components of an index as they were historically.

00:01:13.555 --> 00:01:15.625
That's actually what we do here.

00:01:15.625 --> 00:01:18.200
We're using the S&amp;P 500 index.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.770
The S&amp;P 500 is an index that's managed by Standard and Poor's.

00:01:22.769 --> 00:01:25.594
They managed index, adds, and deletes.

00:01:25.594 --> 00:01:28.789
By choosing our stock universe to include the stocks when they're in

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.230
the index and exclude them when they are no longer in the index,

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.855
we can more faithfully simulate a portfolio

00:01:35.855 --> 00:01:38.620
that would have existed in that point in time,

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.840
thereby reducing look-ahead bias.
