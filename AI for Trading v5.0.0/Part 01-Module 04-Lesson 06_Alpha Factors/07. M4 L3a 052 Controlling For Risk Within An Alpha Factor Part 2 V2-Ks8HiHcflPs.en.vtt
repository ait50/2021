00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.910
So now that we've controlled for market risk,

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.130
how can we control sector risk at this point.

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:09.539
We often want our alpha factor to be sector neutral

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:12.449
so that it's not exposed to overall movements within

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.689
a sector and this means that we want our short weights in

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:20.019
the sector to be equal in magnitude to our long waits in the sector.

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:24.300
We achieve this by calculating the average of all weights in the sector

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.115
then subtracting the sector mean from each weight within that sector.

00:00:29.114 --> 00:00:32.625
Again, will make the simplifying assumption that

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:36.500
each stock's Beta to its sector is equal to 1.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.640
Let's look at a simple example with

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.454
only two stocks in the tech sector; Apple an Alphabet.

00:00:42.454 --> 00:00:45.729
To make our alpha factor neutral to the tech sector,

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:48.379
we could go along one of these stocks and short the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.304
other with the weight of the same magnitude.

00:00:51.304 --> 00:00:55.075
If we think about our raw Alpha factor,

00:00:55.075 --> 00:00:58.554
let's say that Apple's raw Alpha value is

00:00:58.554 --> 00:01:05.394
0.33 and Alphabet's are raw alpha value is 2.31.

00:01:05.394 --> 00:01:12.494
The average is 1.32 and we subtract this mean from each stock's raw-value.

00:01:12.495 --> 00:01:17.450
So Apple's sector neutral Alpha value is now negative

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.909
0.99 and Alphabets is positive 0.99.

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.069
So by subtracting the industry average,

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:31.759
we're able to convert this raw Alpha factor into an Alpha factor that is sector neutral.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.915
Again this is because the sum of the negative weights is

00:01:35.915 --> 00:01:41.165
equal to the magnitude of the sum of the positive weights in each sector.

00:01:41.165 --> 00:01:43.870
If the entire sector were to move up or down,

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.870
the sector neutral portfolio would be unlikely affected by this movement.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.579
A portfolio would likely consist of multiple sectors.

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:56.465
So we'd repeat the sector neutralization for each sector.

00:01:56.465 --> 00:02:01.420
Note that we can neutralize the Alpha vector by market and also by sector.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.189
So in practice, we could first neutralized by

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:09.280
the market and then take that re-scaled vector and neutralize it by sector.
