00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.139
So far, we've looked at evaluation metrics that

00:00:04.139 --> 00:00:08.289
assume unlimited liquidity in zero transaction costs.

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:12.839
In other words, we've assumed that we can buy or short the stocks when we

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:18.390
want and at the market price without cost or impact to that marketplace.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.335
We also saw that, increasing the number of stocks and the number of trades

00:00:22.335 --> 00:00:26.575
can improve one evaluation metric, the information ratio.

00:00:26.574 --> 00:00:30.714
However, when we include real-world constraints and costs,

00:00:30.714 --> 00:00:34.804
there are reasons why more trades aren't always better.

00:00:34.804 --> 00:00:37.079
When trading in the real market,

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.839
there are constraints due to both liquidity and transaction costs.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.859
Liquidity of a stock refers to how likely one can

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:49.984
buy or sell the stock when they want to in the amount that they want to.

00:00:49.984 --> 00:00:53.769
A proxy for liquidity is the bid-ask spread.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.200
The bid-ask spread is the difference between the price that

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.310
an investor can buy versus sell immediately in the market.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.075
High liquid stocks that trade in high amounts every day have

00:01:06.075 --> 00:01:11.600
many shares that are accessible to the public and can be borrowed for short positions.

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:18.694
Examples would be large market cap stocks in highly developed stock markets like the US.

00:01:18.694 --> 00:01:25.074
The bid-ask spreads in liquid stocks maybe around three to five basis points.

00:01:25.075 --> 00:01:30.200
For example, if the price at which one can sell a stock is

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.775
$100 and the price at which one can buy a stock is 100.05,

00:01:36.775 --> 00:01:41.165
then the bid-ask spread is said to be five basis points.

00:01:41.165 --> 00:01:43.325
Low liquidity stocks have

00:01:43.325 --> 00:01:49.045
fewer accessible shares or are traded on a less active exchange.

00:01:49.045 --> 00:01:54.519
You may also refer to low liquidity as highly illiquid.

00:01:54.519 --> 00:02:01.664
Bid-ask spreads for less liquid stocks maybe 20 to 30 basis points.

00:02:01.665 --> 00:02:04.760
Remember, a decent Alpha factor might have

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.305
an annual return of four percent or 400 basis points.

00:02:09.305 --> 00:02:11.064
When you think about that,

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:16.960
a bid-ask spread of 20 to 30 basis points on a single trade is massive.
