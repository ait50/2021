00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280
You may be wondering how to come up with alpha factors and trading strategies.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.370
Some sources of inspiration,

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.289
maybe reading financial news,

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:11.069
observing the markets for curious behavior,

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.429
studying the methods of famous investors both

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.149
discretionary and want or talking to industry practitioners.

00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:22.049
We'll explore academic research papers as a source for

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.975
alpha factor ideas through the remainder of this lesson and in the next lesson.

00:00:26.975 --> 00:00:30.705
It's important to understand a key point before we do this.

00:00:30.704 --> 00:00:33.019
We should not expect to get

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.480
strong production-ready alphas ''as is'' from academic papers.

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:42.500
Why not? Because the very act of publication which makes the paper

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.784
publicly available also diffuses this information into the market.

00:00:47.784 --> 00:00:50.719
As participants adopt the trading strategy,

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.689
the strength of the effect is diffused.

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:56.879
Why then do we look at academic papers at all?

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.645
For four reasons.

00:00:58.645 --> 00:01:04.844
First, these papers can spur idea generation for us to create derivative works.

00:01:04.844 --> 00:01:11.974
Second, the work conserve as baseline factors to compare with our own alpha generation.

00:01:11.974 --> 00:01:15.679
Third, we can learn how professional full-time

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.825
researchers approach problems and validate their findings.

00:01:19.825 --> 00:01:25.990
Fourth, perhaps we can learn about new sources of data or novel ways to work with data.

00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:31.149
Academic research can be published in general interests economic journals,

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.805
investment focused journals, or open source journals.

00:01:34.805 --> 00:01:38.450
General interest journals and investment focused journals both

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.659
require peer review and require a paid subscription.

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.670
Open source repositories usually include working papers that

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.795
have not yet been peer reviewed and are also free.

00:01:50.795 --> 00:01:54.480
Open source repositories for research papers include,

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.885
SSRN and the archive.

00:01:56.885 --> 00:02:00.350
One benefit to using open source journals is that there's

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:03.819
a broader selection of papers and their ideas more recent,

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:07.004
since peer review is a process that takes time.

00:02:07.004 --> 00:02:12.379
It helps to figure out which other papers cite a particular article,

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:14.599
to see how other researchers attempted to

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.379
replicate critique or improve upon the original idea.

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.685
Once you've found some papers of interests,

00:02:20.685 --> 00:02:25.180
scan the abstract and find out if the data use is accessible to you.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.800
Focus on papers for which the data is

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.064
accessible so that you may try to replicate their work.

00:02:31.064 --> 00:02:35.620
Check that the methodology could potentially be practical.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.420
Academic papers almost never include

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:43.389
real-world constraints like transaction costs or liquidity directly.

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:46.250
You need to make a judgment quickly if you think adding

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.974
these constraints will completely invalidate the ideas presented.

00:02:49.974 --> 00:02:53.484
Some papers include these aspects in a roundabout way.

00:02:53.485 --> 00:02:56.270
They conducted Turnover Analysis or they choose

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.465
a stock universe that includes more illiquid stocks.

00:02:59.465 --> 00:03:02.479
Some examples of impractical methods may

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:06.064
include choosing a large universe of say 8,000 stocks,

00:03:06.064 --> 00:03:08.599
in which most of the factor returns are derived from

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.449
a subset of the small and micro cap stocks.

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:15.379
Remember that small and micro cap stocks are less liquid and factors that

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:20.180
rely on illiquid stocks may be difficult to implement in practice.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.515
Note that the process of finding academic papers, studying papers,

00:03:24.514 --> 00:03:27.514
implementing the papers and then evaluating them

00:03:27.514 --> 00:03:31.244
is a very important skill to have as a quantitative researcher.

00:03:31.245 --> 00:03:34.224
We hope to walk you through some of these examples,

00:03:34.224 --> 00:03:36.680
so that you will eventually have the confidence

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.200
to conduct your own research after this course.
