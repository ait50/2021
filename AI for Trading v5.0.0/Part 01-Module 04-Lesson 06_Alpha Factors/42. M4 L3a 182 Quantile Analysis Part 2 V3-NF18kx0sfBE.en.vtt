00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.025
Here's an example of an ideal Alpha factors quintile performance.

00:00:05.025 --> 00:00:07.020
The fifth group containing

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:12.129
the highest Alpha values would ideally give the highest returns.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.365
There would also ideally be a smooth progression,

00:00:16.364 --> 00:00:18.294
down the fourth, third,

00:00:18.295 --> 00:00:20.345
second, and first groups.

00:00:20.344 --> 00:00:25.279
That is the fourth group would have lower returns than the fifth group,

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.234
but higher than the other groups.

00:00:27.234 --> 00:00:31.100
The first group would ideally have the lowest returns,

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.245
and the second group would have the second lowest returns.

00:00:34.244 --> 00:00:37.274
It's common for the tails to show predictive power;

00:00:37.274 --> 00:00:40.714
that is group five may have higher returns,

00:00:40.715 --> 00:00:44.450
group one low returns, but groups two, three,

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.600
and four have returns not that much distinguishable from zero.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.130
In these scenarios, the Alpha model's performance is

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.725
more reliant on a smaller subset of the Alpha vector.

00:00:55.725 --> 00:00:58.039
In other words, on any given day,

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:03.119
the factor return is due to the model being right on a subset of the stocks.

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:07.179
Similarly, it's also possible for the tails to show

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.195
less predictive power and for most

00:01:10.194 --> 00:01:13.344
of the factor return to be attributed to the middle groups;

00:01:13.344 --> 00:01:14.694
two, three, and four.

00:01:14.694 --> 00:01:17.409
Again, this means that a subset of

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.189
the entire Alpha vector appears to get it right on any given day,

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:27.484
and it's usually less correct when the Alpha number is either very high or very low.

00:01:27.484 --> 00:01:31.530
You must diagnose these situations very carefully.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.924
In most cases you want to see a monotonic relationship.

00:01:36.924 --> 00:01:42.539
Each successive quantile produces a higher return than the previous one.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.175
In general, if you don't see this it could

00:01:46.174 --> 00:01:50.359
indicate that your factor is not robust and invalid.

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:54.004
However, there are exceptions and you should think

00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:58.039
about this before you run the quintile analysis.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.710
One example is the Sloan's accrual anomaly which you can read about on the link below.

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:06.500
Whenever the factor return relies on

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.194
a smaller subset of the Alpha vector having predictive power,

00:02:10.194 --> 00:02:14.669
then there's higher risk associated with using that Alpha.
