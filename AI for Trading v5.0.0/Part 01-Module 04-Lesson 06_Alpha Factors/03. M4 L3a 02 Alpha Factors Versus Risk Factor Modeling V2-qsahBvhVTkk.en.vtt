00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.995
Since we just talked about risk factors,

00:00:02.995 --> 00:00:05.939
let's talk about how both the risk and

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.714
alpha factors help us create successful portfolios and how they're different.

00:00:11.714 --> 00:00:16.019
We use risk factors in risk factor models to help

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:19.669
us model the movement of our stocks prices due to

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.160
common publicly known factors that may explain price movements in

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.789
a broad cross-section of stocks defined as systematic returns and systematic volatility.

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.509
Since these risk factors may significantly impact

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:37.989
our portfolio volatility without

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.045
providing appropriate compensation in the form of returns,

00:00:41.045 --> 00:00:45.715
our goal is to neutralize the portfolio's exposure to these risk factors,

00:00:45.715 --> 00:00:47.930
so that their remaining movements of stocks in

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:52.034
our portfolio can be attributable to our alpha factors.

00:00:52.034 --> 00:00:55.609
We can use an analogy where factors are

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:59.524
sounds that you hear when eating lunch at a busy restaurant.

00:00:59.524 --> 00:01:03.344
Risk factors are like the background noise,

00:01:03.344 --> 00:01:05.750
like the conversations of all the patrons,

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.790
the noise from the servers and the kitchen noises.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.760
The alpha factors are like

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.785
the soft voices of your friends who are sitting with you for lunch.

00:01:14.784 --> 00:01:18.049
If we don't neutralize the background noise,

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.319
it may drown out the sound of your friends voices.

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:27.844
Similarly, alpha factors have important information that may be overwhelmed

00:01:27.844 --> 00:01:31.010
by the movements of risk factors such as

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.200
the movements of the market or movements of a sector.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.500
We want to isolate the effect of alpha factors.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.469
To do that, we eliminate the effect of risk factors.
