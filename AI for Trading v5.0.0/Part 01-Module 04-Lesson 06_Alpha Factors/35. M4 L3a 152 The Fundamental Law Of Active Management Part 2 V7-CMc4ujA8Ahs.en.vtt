00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.849
The breadth is the number of independent trading opportunities annualized.

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:09.469
The key insight on this is the word "independent."

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.460
For example, if we are

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.440
long 30 oil services stocks and short 30 semiconductor stocks for a year,

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.075
how many independent bets is that?

00:00:20.074 --> 00:00:22.750
The answer is one.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.605
Not 60, one.

00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:31.160
Why? Because we expect the stock holdings in each sector are diversified

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.070
to such an extent that we are likely not going to

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.024
get any material impact from any one stock,

00:00:37.024 --> 00:00:39.710
and we have simply one bet that

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.179
the oil service sector will outperform the semiconductor sector.

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:46.820
The key takeaway here is that in order to

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.340
maximize the number of independent bets in our portfolio,

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.145
we need to remove exposure to common risk factors.

00:00:54.145 --> 00:01:00.515
Again, risk factors are factors which indicate which stocks have strong commonality.

00:01:00.515 --> 00:01:04.094
If we hold positions with strong commonality,

00:01:04.094 --> 00:01:07.420
then we are not holding independent positions.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.355
At the Alpha research stage,

00:01:09.355 --> 00:01:13.590
this is precisely why we often demean by sector.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.329
One way to improve our Sharpe ratio is to increase

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:22.349
the probability that our Alpha factor can accurately choose the correct stocks.

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:25.854
This is measured by the information coefficient.

00:01:25.855 --> 00:01:31.740
We should always strive to do this but recognize that this is indeed very challenging.

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:34.759
The other way to improve performance is to

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.365
increase the number of independent bets we make.

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:40.670
This is the breadth.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.409
This is the key advantage quants have over everyone else;

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.744
the ability to achieve high breadth.

00:01:47.745 --> 00:01:50.045
In general, a reason why

00:01:50.045 --> 00:01:54.200
institutional investors take a cross-sectional approach of trading

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.620
multiple stocks is to maximize breadth and

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.255
improve their performance which can be measured as the information ratio.

00:02:02.254 --> 00:02:07.344
Additionally, institutional investors will combine many Alpha factors,

00:02:07.344 --> 00:02:10.949
again to maximize breadth.
