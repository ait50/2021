00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
Since liquidity and transaction costs are

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.425
dependent upon market conditions at the time of a trade,

00:00:06.424 --> 00:00:11.500
it's difficult to simulate actual transaction costs when evaluating an Alpha factor.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.609
So a useful proxy for these real-world constraints is to measure turnover.

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.669
Generally, factors that are updated quarterly such as fundamental factors,

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.920
have lower turnover compared to factors that are

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.135
updated daily such as those based on price and volume data.

00:00:30.135 --> 00:00:32.820
Turnover measures what fraction of

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.549
the portfolio's total value gets traded in a time period.

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:43.349
For example, let's say a portfolio is valued at $100 million.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.240
On a single day, let's imagine one million dollars

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.475
are brought and another one million dollars are sold.

00:00:49.475 --> 00:00:52.984
So, the turnover in this case is two million dollars

00:00:52.984 --> 00:00:56.549
divided by 100 million or two percent.

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:02.280
Since we're out the Alpha research stage and not dealing with an actual portfolio,

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.359
turnover can be defined in terms of the change in portfolio weights.

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:10.760
We calculate turnover by taking the difference between

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.270
weights for each stock between yesterday and today,

00:01:15.269 --> 00:01:21.229
then we sum up the absolute values of the weights for all stocks in the portfolio.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.234
Recall that when constructing an Alpha factor,

00:01:24.234 --> 00:01:27.859
we're likely to convert raw factor values into ranks.

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:30.950
So, there is another way in which we can measure

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.930
turnover called the Factor Rank auto-correlation. We'll see this next
