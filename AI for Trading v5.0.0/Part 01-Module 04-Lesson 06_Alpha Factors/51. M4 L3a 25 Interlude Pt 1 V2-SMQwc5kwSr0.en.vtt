00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:04.665
Well, hello there. Thanks for joining me.

00:00:04.665 --> 00:00:08.919
I'm just going to pop in here and share some thoughts about reading research papers.

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:11.960
I remember when I got started doing academic work,

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.585
reading a research paper felt like a daunting task.

00:00:15.585 --> 00:00:19.589
I understood that reading a research paper meant sitting down with

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:23.644
a cup of tea and reading the paper like I would a book from cover to cover,

00:00:23.644 --> 00:00:25.844
trying to absorb every word.

00:00:25.844 --> 00:00:27.739
When I accomplished this successfully,

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:29.264
it took me several hours.

00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:31.535
When I failed, I would leave off in the middle,

00:00:31.535 --> 00:00:34.655
often not remembering what I learned at the beginning.

00:00:34.655 --> 00:00:37.859
It must be said that being able to read and learn

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:40.829
from a research paper quickly comes with experience,

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.989
but also comes with experience in the specific field you're reading about.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.465
This is because research projects in

00:00:47.465 --> 00:00:51.755
each very specific niche field are highly interdependent.

00:00:51.755 --> 00:00:56.450
When you see that one paper is basically using the same method as another,

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.429
and you already understand that method,

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:01.130
you can skip that entire method section.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.040
When you see that a paper references another paper for some idea,

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.920
and you've already read that other paper,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.310
because it's a very influential or so-called classic paper in the field,

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.234
you'll understand the reference.

00:01:13.234 --> 00:01:16.989
There's no easy, quick way to gain this knowledge that I know of.

00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:22.969
It's one reason that developing expertise in a field is a long, hard one process.

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:26.659
But there are some things to know about research papers and

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.594
some strategies you can take to make the process a little easier.

00:01:30.594 --> 00:01:35.405
I think the most important thing to remember is that you don't have to read everything.

00:01:35.405 --> 00:01:39.405
Research papers are designed in such a way as to show you,

00:01:39.405 --> 00:01:42.924
the reader, where to find different types of information.

00:01:42.924 --> 00:01:45.799
Perhaps the second most important thing to remember

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.109
is that research papers are written by people.

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:50.200
They are not infallible,

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.430
they're not gospel, and they are not

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.690
perfect at communicating what they aim to communicate.

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.840
What I mean to say is that if you don't understand something you're reading,

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.870
it may be that you lack the background to understand it,

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.550
but it may also be that the paper's author wrote it in a way that they understand it,

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.060
but not in a way that anyone else can understand it.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.939
Often, the author is writing to an audience that

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:16.870
already knows the field, not to a new comer.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.939
Instead of banging your head against the wall, so to speak,

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:23.419
or rereading the same section many times,

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:27.349
you may have to go elsewhere for a better understanding of the topic.
