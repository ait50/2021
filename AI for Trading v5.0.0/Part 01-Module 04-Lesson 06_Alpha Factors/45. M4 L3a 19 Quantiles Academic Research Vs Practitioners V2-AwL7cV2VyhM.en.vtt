00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.618
As practitioners, we were reading academic research papers for insights.

00:00:04.618 --> 00:00:06.330
So, it's helpful to know

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.155
how academic papers and practitioners view quantiles differently.

00:00:11.154 --> 00:00:15.089
Academic papers tend to take raw alpha signals,

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.475
which are not ranked,

00:00:16.475 --> 00:00:19.520
and split them into quantiles only.

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:23.399
Their analysis usually focuses on the tails.

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:26.529
That is, the highest and lowest quantiles.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.259
The reason that academic researchers are focused on this,

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.380
is that they want to detect broadly applicable market phenomenon,

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.330
and are not necessarily interested in how to implement a trading strategy.

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.324
Because of this, you may notice that certain academic research

00:00:43.325 --> 00:00:47.810
will find an effect in just one tail such as the lowest quintile,

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.390
while they find less of an effect in

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.149
the other tail quantile or even in the other quantiles in between.

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.634
Note that this means that the abnormal returns that they detect in such a paper,

00:00:59.634 --> 00:01:02.774
may only work on a subset of the stock universe.

00:01:02.774 --> 00:01:06.769
Practitioners have the goal of implementing a trading strategy that

00:01:06.769 --> 00:01:10.774
can be applied to all the assets in their universe.

00:01:10.775 --> 00:01:13.630
This means that with quintile analysis,

00:01:13.629 --> 00:01:18.224
practitioners care about how the factor performs across all quantile groups,

00:01:18.224 --> 00:01:20.179
not just one or two tails.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.000
This is because practitioners want to see how the factor

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.870
influences all stocks and there trading universe.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.510
So, even if a research study found that an alpha factor

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.405
only worked in the subset of the quantile distribution,

00:01:33.405 --> 00:01:36.230
the practitioner will view this as

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:42.120
a graded spectrum in order to generate an alpha number for every stock in their universe.
