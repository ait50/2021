00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
So far, we've been looking at simple individual alpha factors.

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.794
But there are times when we can create factors that are conditioned on another factor.

00:00:10.794 --> 00:00:16.695
We can create a conditional factor by multiplying two factors together.

00:00:16.695 --> 00:00:22.940
For example, if factor A gives an alpha value for a single stock,

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:28.145
and factor B gives a different alpha value for that same stock,

00:00:28.144 --> 00:00:30.949
then we can create a conditioned,

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.700
alpha value for that stock by multiplying those two separate alpha values together.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.640
Early on in my career,

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.880
it was the case that some fairly simple,

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.620
at least as thought of in hindsight today,

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:46.919
factors could be profitable in live trading.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.145
Markets though have become much more competitive as time has marched on and as data,

00:00:53.145 --> 00:00:56.525
tools, and knowledge have become more available.

00:00:56.524 --> 00:00:59.750
Today, it's likely that you need to find

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.250
conditionals to make really good alpha factors as such,

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.685
this section is critical.

00:01:06.685 --> 00:01:10.635
So, how do we interpret what this multiplication is doing?

00:01:10.635 --> 00:01:14.689
We'll first look at a common practice in academic papers,

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.459
which we'll refer to as quantiles of quantiles.

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:24.854
If a research paper is looking at the effects of one factor condition on another,

00:01:24.855 --> 00:01:29.510
they would divide the data into quantiles for one factor.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.219
Let's say we're using 10 decile groups,

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:38.030
then within each decile group they would split

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.299
the stocks into another 10 decile groups based on the second factor.

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:49.739
So, now we have 100 quantile groups conditioned on two factors.

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:53.539
Because we have 10 deciles based on one factor and

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.195
each decile group has 10 deciles based on the second factor.

00:01:58.194 --> 00:02:03.094
Now, let's see what happens if we create a condition factor based on two factors.

00:02:03.094 --> 00:02:08.210
Let's say we have a stock universe of 100 stocks and we'll convert

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.715
signal A and signal B into scores from one to 10 for each signal,

00:02:13.715 --> 00:02:18.844
then we'll calculate the conditional factor as signal A times signal B.

00:02:18.844 --> 00:02:24.064
Let's pause a moment to think what multiplication means visually.

00:02:24.064 --> 00:02:27.680
If you remember learning your multiplication tables as a kid,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.790
you might remember seeing a rectangular grid with a column of

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:36.754
numbers 1-10 along the left edge and the numbers 1-10 above the top.

00:02:36.754 --> 00:02:39.724
Multiplying the two numbers for each row and column

00:02:39.724 --> 00:02:43.189
allows us to fill all the boxes inside the multiplication table.

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:47.240
This is exactly what we're doing with our two factors.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.685
As you can see, the product of A times B,

00:02:50.685 --> 00:02:55.310
ranges from a value of one to a value of a hundred.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.900
Notice that, not all the values in between one and 100 are represented,

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.724
as there are some numbers that occur twice.

00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:09.379
However, overall, you can see that there is a range of values between one and a hundred.

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:12.000
Does this look familiar to you?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.215
When we discuss the process of calculating deciles nested inside deciles,

00:03:17.215 --> 00:03:20.360
we also ended up with 100 groups.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.600
Even though multiplication of the two factors does not give

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.400
the exact same groupings as we would get from nested quantiles,

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.810
they have the same goal of creating

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.395
a composite factor that is conditioned on the value of both the individual factors.

00:03:35.395 --> 00:03:38.630
We will seek some conditional factors in detail when we

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:42.319
analyze some research papers to generate factor ideas.

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.995
When you read ideas or hypotheses like,

00:03:45.995 --> 00:03:49.640
stocks that go up on high volume are likely to revert,

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:53.844
or momentum is more pronounced on stocks with low volume,

00:03:53.844 --> 00:03:56.115
you need to use conditionals.

00:03:56.115 --> 00:04:00.165
Also, whenever you see the word or concept of end,

00:04:00.164 --> 00:04:03.929
it is likely that you need to use a conditional.
