00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.254
More formally, here are the steps we'll take to calculate the Rank IC.

00:00:05.254 --> 00:00:07.089
For each time period,

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:09.285
rank the raw Alpha factor.

00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:12.939
For instance, with a stock universe of three stocks,

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:15.809
the lowest Alpha value has a rank of 1,

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.940
and the highest Alpha value has a rank of 3.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.015
Also, calculate the forward asset returns and rank them.

00:00:24.015 --> 00:00:28.500
The stock with the lowest forward return has a rank of 1,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.075
and the stock with the highest forward return has a rank of 3.

00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:36.185
The correlation of ranked values is called

00:00:36.185 --> 00:00:41.670
the Spearman rank correlation to distinguish it from the Pearson correlation.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.835
Let's clarify these two terms.

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:47.719
The Pearson correlation is what you're probably familiar with,

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:50.449
is the covariance of two variables which is then

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.340
re-scaled using the standard deviations of the two variables.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.560
The denominator makes the correlation range from negative 1 to 1.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:05.650
The Pearson Correlation is also the square root of the R-squared in a linear regression.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.050
Recall that the R-squared represents the proportion of

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.784
variance in one variable that is explained by the second variable.

00:01:13.784 --> 00:01:18.090
The Spearman rank correlation is the same as the Pearson correlation,

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.380
except the variables x and y are converted to

00:01:21.379 --> 00:01:25.859
ranks before calculating the covariance and standard deviations.

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:27.905
To get the rank IC,

00:01:27.905 --> 00:01:31.445
calculate the correlation between the ranked Alpha vector

00:01:31.444 --> 00:01:35.629
and the ranked forward asset returns for a single time period.

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:40.204
Repeat this over multiple time periods to get a time series.

00:01:40.204 --> 00:01:42.844
You may be wondering why we use

00:01:42.844 --> 00:01:46.870
the Spearman rank correlation as opposed to the Pearson correlation.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.469
That is why do we use ranking?

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:56.019
The answer is because we don't care about being wrong in the right direction.

00:01:56.019 --> 00:02:01.769
Let's say stock ABC is our top Alpha value in a universe of 2,000 stocks.

00:02:01.769 --> 00:02:05.824
Our alpha value will likely be a small positive value,

00:02:05.825 --> 00:02:12.180
then imagine that ABC outperforms all the other stocks not by a small amount,

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.314
but by a very large amount.

00:02:14.314 --> 00:02:18.020
The Pearson correlation would calculate a lower score

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.615
effectively penalizing us because we didn't get the relative magnitude correct.

00:02:22.615 --> 00:02:27.300
On the other hand, the Spearman rank correlation would not be affected by this.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.730
We prefer to use ranking to evaluate our performance because

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:36.869
what matters is that our Alpha is still profitable as we had hoped.
