00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.530
We saw earlier that the rank IC can tell us overall how well

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.735
an Alpha vector's predictions align

00:00:06.735 --> 00:00:09.865
with the subsequent stock returns for the next period.

00:00:09.865 --> 00:00:12.359
You may be wondering if it's possible to drill down

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:15.494
deeper to look at the Alpha values assigned each stock

00:00:15.494 --> 00:00:17.849
to see which subset of stocks actually

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.535
contribute most or least to the factor return of the portfolio.

00:00:21.535 --> 00:00:26.179
Ideally, if our Alpha model and hypothesis were accurate,

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:29.225
the stock with the highest Alpha value for that day

00:00:29.225 --> 00:00:33.285
would also have the highest positive return the next day.

00:00:33.284 --> 00:00:37.039
Similarly, the stock with the lowest Alpha value for

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:41.719
that day would also have the lowest return in the next day,

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:47.379
which would be good for our theoretical portfolio since we would be shorting that stock.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.210
Remember, that we are working with

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.380
perhaps hundreds or even thousands of stocks in our universe.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.850
So, a good middle ground is to divide our Alpha vector into

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.719
quantiles and analyze their returns and volatility within those quantiles.

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:09.170
An ideal Alpha model would be one where the group of stocks containing

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.590
the highest Alpha values for that day would also have the highest average return,

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.799
and possibly, the highest risk adjusted to return.

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:20.810
Similarly, the group of stocks containing

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.585
the lowest Alpha values would ideally have the lowest returns.

00:01:25.584 --> 00:01:29.538
For example, if we have 25 stocks in our universe

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.920
and wanted divide them up each into five groups of equal size,

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.344
we would be using five quantiles also called quintiles.

00:01:38.344 --> 00:01:42.500
For each day, we'll sort the stocks by their Alpha value.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.034
The five highest values go in the fifth group,

00:01:45.034 --> 00:01:47.259
which are above the fourth quintile.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.930
The stocks with the lowest five values go in the first group,

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.860
which are below the first quintile.

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:56.790
Similarly, we fill groups 2, 3,

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.390
4, with five stocks each based on their Alpha value.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.790
We can keep track of the individual returns within

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.290
each of the five groups over a time window such as one,

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:09.804
three, or five years.

00:02:09.805 --> 00:02:12.530
Then we can calculate the mean return within

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.435
each group as well as the standard deviation.

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:20.944
We can call what we just did quantile analysis or quantile performance.

00:02:20.944 --> 00:02:23.664
Since we chose five quantiles,

00:02:23.664 --> 00:02:27.669
we can also call this quintile performance.
