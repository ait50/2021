00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.264
In some alpha factor papers that we'll discuss in the next lesson,

00:00:04.264 --> 00:00:08.609
the academic research discusses findings that are specific to

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:13.484
one direction or one tail end of a particular attribute.

00:00:13.484 --> 00:00:16.394
A practitioner's approach is to think about

00:00:16.394 --> 00:00:19.714
extending the interpretation of the academic conclusion,

00:00:19.714 --> 00:00:24.500
so that it can be more readily applied to general situations.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.204
For example, in an alpha factor that we'll discuss,

00:00:28.204 --> 00:00:32.054
the curvature of a stock's price path over time

00:00:32.054 --> 00:00:36.695
has some predictive value of its future expected performance.

00:00:36.695 --> 00:00:41.469
Even though the paper itself doesn't discuss linear trajectories,

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:45.935
a practitioner would want to find some meaningful hypothesis

00:00:45.935 --> 00:00:50.675
about straight lines and how they compare to convex or concave functions.

00:00:50.674 --> 00:00:56.269
In other words, when a straight line is compared to a convex curve,

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.150
the line is relatively more concave than the convex curve.

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.810
By thinking how an academic finding can be applied more

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.784
broadly to a full range of a particular attribute,

00:01:09.784 --> 00:01:13.459
a practitioner has a better chance of creating an alpha factor that

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:17.599
can more generally be applied to the entire stock universe.
