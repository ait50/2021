00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.779
It's common for researchers to normalize alpha factors

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:07.945
by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.

00:00:07.945 --> 00:00:13.765
We can also refer to this process as Z-scoring because the result is a Z-score.

00:00:13.765 --> 00:00:16.580
Z-scoring helps to standardize the data,

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:19.479
so that it has a consistent range and distribution.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.105
This makes it easier to compare and combine more than one alpha factor.

00:00:24.105 --> 00:00:28.380
For instance, if we assume a somewhat Gaussian distribution,

00:00:28.379 --> 00:00:31.289
then about 95 percent of the values in

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.250
a Z-scored distribution would be roughly between negative two and positive two.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.649
Notice that a ranking also has

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.539
a similar benefit of setting different alpha vectors on the same scale.

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.210
Whatever the original raw alpha values are for

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.509
two different alpha factors when we convert to ranks,

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:54.399
if we had a universe of 100 stocks,

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:59.104
then the ranking for any alpha would be the integers 1-100.

00:00:59.104 --> 00:01:04.554
Note that Z-scoring has an additional benefit that you wouldn't get from ranking.

00:01:04.555 --> 00:01:08.690
Z-scoring sets alpha vectors on a comparable scale

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:13.519
even when we're dealing with differently sized stock universes.

00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:19.219
For instance, certain alpha factors may be generated on different stock universes.

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:23.030
So, if we had one alpha factor calculated on a universe of

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.469
100 stocks and another alpha factor calculated on 500 stocks,

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:32.414
the rankings for the first would range from 1-100,

00:01:32.415 --> 00:01:36.335
while the rankings for the second would range from 1-500.

00:01:36.334 --> 00:01:39.669
Converting the ranks into a Z-score would rescale

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.585
the two alpha vectors so that they could be comparable and more readily combined.

00:01:44.584 --> 00:01:46.909
Recall that ranking still makes

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.984
our alpha vectors more robust against outliers and noisy data,

00:01:50.984 --> 00:01:54.670
and Z-scoring does not provide the same benefit.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.835
So, a valid approach would be to use ranking only

00:01:58.834 --> 00:02:03.294
when you know that all your alpha vectors are using the same stock universe.

00:02:03.295 --> 00:02:07.165
It's also useful to apply ranking and then Z-scoring,

00:02:07.165 --> 00:02:09.800
if you think that some of your alpha vectors may

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.920
be generated on different stock universes.

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:17.849
One thing to remember is that when you work in a large asset management company,

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.905
you may be one of many alpha researchers,

00:02:20.905 --> 00:02:23.120
and there may be other team members,

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.325
portfolio managers, who use your alpha vectors.

00:02:26.324 --> 00:02:29.209
In this case, the portfolio managers want to

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.409
get standardized outputs from all the quants.

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:35.719
Z-scoring is one way to achieve this.

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:38.939
Academic research often uses Z-scoring,

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:42.650
as many papers are based on the work of Fama and French,

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.530
who designed one of the first multi-factor models.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.585
Since this paper has influenced many subsequent papers in the study of factors,

00:02:50.585 --> 00:02:54.200
it's likely you'll see Z-scoring in academic papers.
