00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.790
Let's get back to the interpretation of the factor return.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.730
When initially learning about alpha factors,

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.255
the magnitude of the return can create some confusion.

00:00:10.255 --> 00:00:17.010
In the alphas we work with below the annual returns range from 1%-4% or so.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.220
Let's be honest, that seems really small,

00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:25.254
is that what institutions really want from their researchers?

00:00:25.254 --> 00:00:30.269
The key to placing these returns and context is to understand the concept of

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.729
the return denominator in research and

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:37.409
the actual leverage likely to be used in production trading.

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:40.549
Let's first define return denominator,

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:44.149
when we normalize an alpha vector one of the steps

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.835
is to sum up the absolute values of the alpha values,

00:00:47.835 --> 00:00:51.890
then divide each value by the sum in order for

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.060
the normalized vector to have the sum of absolute values equal to one.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.780
The sum of the absolute magnitudes of

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.025
the alpha values is the denominator that I'm referring to.

00:01:04.025 --> 00:01:10.870
Leverage is the act of borrowing money in order to take positions in assets like stocks.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:16.160
The leverage ratio is the sum of the absolute value of all positions long and

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:22.504
short divided by whatever capital we actually devote to supporting those positions.

00:01:22.504 --> 00:01:27.104
This concept will likely become more clear when we study backtesting in term two,

00:01:27.105 --> 00:01:29.725
until then, think about it this way,

00:01:29.724 --> 00:01:34.064
a trading strategy produces dollars of gains and losses,

00:01:34.064 --> 00:01:38.370
to convert those dollars in terms of returns or in return space,

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.990
we need to divide by some denominator,

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:44.613
which in this case is called the capital denominator.

00:01:44.614 --> 00:01:46.520
At the research stage,

00:01:46.519 --> 00:01:53.474
we ignore this and simply assume one dollar of capital to one dollar of longs and shorts.

00:01:53.474 --> 00:01:56.390
When we increase leverage by putting

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.204
less than one dollar of capital against one dollar of positions,

00:02:00.204 --> 00:02:02.894
the leverage ratio increases.

00:02:02.894 --> 00:02:08.949
A leverage ratio of one means we apply one dollar of capital for one dollar of positions.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:12.009
A leverage ratio of four means,

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:16.459
we apply 25 cents of capital for one dollar of positions.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.105
In research, we are looking at the return of the normalized alpha factor,

00:02:21.104 --> 00:02:23.114
the denominator is one,

00:02:23.115 --> 00:02:25.610
which implies a leverage ratio of one.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.460
In a real trading,

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.650
we would combine several factors and then apply leverage,

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.875
depending on the final portfolio,

00:02:33.875 --> 00:02:39.939
an institution might apply leverage of anywhere from two times to six times.

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:45.979
In the context of that leverage the magnitude of the alpha factor returns start to make

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:48.889
sense and likely look comparable to

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:53.104
the published returns observable from hedge fund return indices.

00:02:53.104 --> 00:02:57.709
This insight should also help explain why I continually

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:03.655
refer to implementing this style of trading as inside an asset management firm.

00:03:03.655 --> 00:03:06.655
It would be very unlikely that an individual,

00:03:06.655 --> 00:03:08.810
could obtain the necessary leverage and

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.640
low-cost market access to allow him or her to trade in this style,

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:15.929
in an individual brokerage account.
