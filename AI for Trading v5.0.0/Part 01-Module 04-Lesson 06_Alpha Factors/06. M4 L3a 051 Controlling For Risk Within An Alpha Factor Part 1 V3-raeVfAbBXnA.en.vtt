00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.020
Okay. Let's say we've read a paper,

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.310
extracted some ideas, and have come up with an Alpha factor.

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:11.309
Now, let's talk about some of the common early transformations we might

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.510
do to that factor in order to move it closer towards our goal.

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.753
A vector of numbers that represents the weights we'd use to create a portfolio.

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:23.780
These transformations help to enhance, improve,

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.035
and prepare our Alpha factors so that they may be used

00:00:27.035 --> 00:00:31.195
during portfolio optimization to choose actual portfolio weights.

00:00:31.195 --> 00:00:34.755
When we actually implement traits for our portfolio,

00:00:34.755 --> 00:00:39.515
we want that portfolio to be neutral to common risk factors.

00:00:39.515 --> 00:00:44.000
We should not wait however for the optimization step to think about

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.480
common risk as we do not want to rely exclusively on optimization to make this happen.

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:57.304
Rather, it's best to consider obvious common risks even at the Alpha research stage.

00:00:57.304 --> 00:01:03.094
The most significant common factor risks are market risk and sector risk.

00:01:03.094 --> 00:01:08.245
We control market risks explicitly by the definition of an Alpha factor.

00:01:08.245 --> 00:01:16.025
The sum of the values is zero implying zero exposure to the market.

00:01:16.025 --> 00:01:19.310
Note that an important assumption that we'll make is that on

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.655
average the Betas or exposure of the stocks to the market are all one.

00:01:24.655 --> 00:01:30.155
So even though in reality the regression Beta of stock ABC to the market may be

00:01:30.155 --> 00:01:35.905
1.2 or the Beta of stock XYZ maybe 0.8.

00:01:35.905 --> 00:01:40.665
When dealing with stock universes of hundreds or thousands of stocks,

00:01:40.665 --> 00:01:45.740
we often can take the simplifying assumption that they all have the same Beta of one.

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:48.254
To get the values to sum to zero,

00:01:48.254 --> 00:01:53.269
we subtract the mean from each Alpha value in the vector.

00:01:53.269 --> 00:01:55.700
When the value sums to zero,

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.600
the theoretical portfolio is said to be dollar neutral,

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:03.939
and so general market movements that affect all stocks are cancelled out.

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.605
This may not precisely eliminate

00:02:06.605 --> 00:02:10.219
all market risk as market Betas may not all be equal to one,

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:13.599
but this is often a fine assumption at this stage.
