00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.620
Just like we did with NumPy arrays,

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:07.620
we can perform element-wise arithmetic operations on Pandas series.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.660
In this video, we will look at

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.449
arithmetic operations between Pandas series and single numbers.

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:18.934
Let's create a new series that holds a grocery list of fruits.

00:00:18.934 --> 00:00:21.989
The first argument we pass in is the data,

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:24.774
and the second argument is the index labels.

00:00:24.774 --> 00:00:30.029
We can modify the data in fruits by performing basic arithmetic operations.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.670
We can add two to each element in fruits,

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.435
subtract two, multiply by two, and divide by two.

00:00:37.435 --> 00:00:40.560
We can also apply mathematical functions from

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.105
NumPy such as square root to all the elements of a series.

00:00:45.104 --> 00:00:49.104
Let's import NumPy and take a look at our fruit series again.

00:00:49.104 --> 00:00:53.419
Using NumPy, we can get the square root of each element like this.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.000
And the exponential of each element,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.655
and each element to the power of two.

00:00:58.655 --> 00:01:05.275
Pandas also allows us to apply arithmetic operations on selected items in a series.

00:01:05.275 --> 00:01:07.310
Here's the fruit series again.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.359
We can add two to just the banana's item, like this.

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:15.819
And let's subtract two from apples using its numerical index.

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:19.039
We can double the apples and oranges like this,

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.720
and divide apples and oranges by two like this.

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:27.189
You can also apply arithmetic operations on a Pandas series of

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:29.679
mixed data types provided that

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.160
the arithmetic operation is defined for all data types in the series.

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.484
To demonstrate this, let's go back to our grocery's list from the previous video,

00:01:38.484 --> 00:01:41.545
and let's multiply this series by two,

00:01:41.545 --> 00:01:46.579
since the multiplication operation is defined for both strings and numbers.

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:49.125
This code doesn't return an error.

00:01:49.125 --> 00:01:52.204
Multiplying a string by two simply repeats it.

00:01:52.204 --> 00:01:57.590
If you were to apply an operation that was valid for numbers but not strings,

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.105
for instance division, you would get an error.

00:02:01.105 --> 00:02:04.605
So, when you have mixed data types in your Pandas series,

00:02:04.605 --> 00:02:07.310
make sure the arithmetic operations you

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.599
use are defined for all the data types in your series.
