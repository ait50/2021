00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.615
Albert Einstein reportedly said,

00:00:02.615 --> 00:00:04.195
"It's not that I'm so smart,

00:00:04.195 --> 00:00:06.655
it's just that I stay with problems longer."

00:00:06.655 --> 00:00:09.240
Your drive to stick with things and see them

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.339
through in a large part will determine your success,

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:14.335
not just with this Nanodegree program,

00:00:14.335 --> 00:00:16.469
but in your job, and in your life.

00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:20.429
Our goal at Udacity is to ensure that you meet your goals.,

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:23.239
so we're here to help you learn like Einstein

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:26.644
did to tackle challenges and persevere through them.

00:00:26.644 --> 00:00:29.300
Our students come from all walks of life,

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.240
and their goals are as varied and different as they are.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.785
But whatever your personal goals are, we have content,

00:00:35.784 --> 00:00:40.029
resources, and support mechanisms to make sure that you reach them.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.450
If you're stuck, or even if you just fancy saying hello,

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.145
remember that your community is here for you.

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:51.320
