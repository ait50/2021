00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
Up until now, you've been treating stock prices as a continuous time series.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:13.169
For instance, the end of day data for stock includes a row for every day or does it?

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:18.314
Here's how Facebook traded over the month of May in 2017.

00:00:18.315 --> 00:00:21.750
As you can see, there's these clumps of five samples and

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.500
then a gap and then another clump and so on.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.690
Take a look at the calendar for that month each clump of

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.585
five dates in the plot corresponds to a workweek.

00:00:33.585 --> 00:00:38.509
These gaps are simply weekends when the market was closed.

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:42.594
Two months later, it's July and we see a similar pattern,

00:00:42.594 --> 00:00:44.094
but here at the beginning,

00:00:44.094 --> 00:00:46.250
there seems to be a date missing,

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.884
its fourth of July a holiday in the United States.

00:00:49.884 --> 00:00:52.684
So, gaps in the data can result from weekends,

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:56.620
holidays, and other reasons the market might be closed.

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:59.524
You might be thinking why is this important?

00:00:59.524 --> 00:01:02.879
After all, if we forget about these missing days,

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.530
the data is still continuous in terms of trading days.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.460
Well, that's true if you treat the price data as

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:12.524
simple sequence and ignore the timestamps,

00:01:12.525 --> 00:01:15.070
then you don't need to worry about the gaps.

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:17.619
Say, you're computing daily returns.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.320
Take the price on each day and subtract it from the price on the previous day.

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:25.484
Well, previous trading day that is.

00:01:25.484 --> 00:01:28.179
For more robust approach to trading,

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.125
you may not want to ignore the missing days.

00:01:31.125 --> 00:01:33.105
Even if the market is closed,

00:01:33.105 --> 00:01:38.215
other events can occur that might influence stock prices when the market reopens.

00:01:38.215 --> 00:01:41.490
For example, company announcements, news articles,

00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:43.439
geopolitical events, natural disasters,

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.325
anything and everything can affect the stock price.

00:01:46.325 --> 00:01:49.189
The more time between two trading days,

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.679
the bigger the window for things to happen.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.250
So, you could try to normalize returns by dividing

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.094
the actual number of days between any two samples.

00:01:59.094 --> 00:02:01.685
This may work in certain applications,

00:02:01.685 --> 00:02:05.045
but can reduce the genuine large differences,

00:02:05.045 --> 00:02:09.110
or you could just use that information about these irregular gaps

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.510
between samples when trying to make trading decisions.

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:16.965
Okay, let's recap, weekends,

00:02:16.965 --> 00:02:22.248
holidays, and other events can cause market to be closed on certain dates.

00:02:22.248 --> 00:02:25.430
These dates may be missing in stock market data,

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.610
you can choose to ignore these gaps,

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.885
normalize for them, or identify and deal with them as needed.

00:02:32.884 --> 00:02:38.269
Another kind of gap you should be aware of is the time between the market

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.390
closes for the day and when it reopens the next day.

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:49.429
Markets often allow some additional trading during the pre and post market sessions.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.004
Few traders participate in these sessions,

00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:53.810
so the volume is low,

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.310
but these transactions can still affect stock prices.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.240
Moreover, when a stock is listed on multiple exchanges around the globe,

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.180
its price may be actually changing around the clock on another exchange.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.849
When a particular market opens for trading,

00:03:10.848 --> 00:03:12.889
the price of that stock can be different from

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:16.539
the closing price on that market from the previous day.

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:20.239
Again, depending on how you are using the price information,

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.105
you may not need to worry about these differences,

00:03:23.104 --> 00:03:28.104
but they may give you an additional clue that you can use for trading.

00:03:28.104 --> 00:03:31.699
A more significant case of missing values is

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:35.869
produced by a major corporate action like listings and mergers.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:42.344
For instance, say you're analyzing stock data from the year 2000 to 2016,

00:03:42.344 --> 00:03:45.340
Google only IPOed in 2004,

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.675
there is no existence of the stock prior to that.

00:03:48.675 --> 00:03:50.385
So, what do you do?

00:03:50.384 --> 00:03:53.299
If you absolutely need a value to work with,

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.740
you can backfill Google's opening price from its IPO date to

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.570
the beginning of your analysis period using the same price for open,

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.379
high, low, and close.

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.560
Since no trading actually happened on these days,

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.784
you can set volume to zero.

00:04:09.784 --> 00:04:11.859
But, this may not be necessary,

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.430
and it can be misleading.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.079
So instead, you can maintain a list of valid ticker symbols that form

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:23.814
the universe of stocks you're considering and this list can change from day to day.

00:04:23.814 --> 00:04:29.569
A more bizarre case happens when a company is delisted from exchange.

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:35.680
Perhaps because they went bankrupt or got bought out entirely by private investors.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.240
Dell went private in 2013 by buying back all its public shares.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.805
No record of Dell stock exists from that point onwards.

00:04:45.805 --> 00:04:50.275
If you held a share of Dell stock on that day it went private,

00:04:50.274 --> 00:04:52.554
it's not like you'd lost that investment,

00:04:52.555 --> 00:04:55.540
you would have been paid by Dell for that share.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.300
So, it would be wrong to assume that the price dropped to zero.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.110
One way to mitigate this is to fill the last known price on

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.220
the stock forward till the end of your analysis period,

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.819
or if you're simulating trades over that time period,

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:13.699
you can force sell the stock on that date and

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:17.474
remove Dell from the stock universe going forward.

00:05:17.475 --> 00:05:20.510
How you ultimately deal with this misleading values will

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:23.829
depend on exactly what you're trying to do with the data,

00:05:23.829 --> 00:05:25.519
but completely ignoring them,

00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:27.529
might not be the right choice.
