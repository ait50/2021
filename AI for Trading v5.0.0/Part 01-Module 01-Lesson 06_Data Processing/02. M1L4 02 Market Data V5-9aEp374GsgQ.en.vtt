00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.370
Let's start with market data.

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.634
This is any data that you receive from the market typically generated from trades.

00:00:07.634 --> 00:00:12.583
This is perhaps the most important form of data relevant to quantitative analysis.

00:00:12.583 --> 00:00:15.330
Market data is temporal in nature,

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.509
it's a series of trading events that happen in a moment of time,

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.570
each moment is called a tick.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.210
A ticker contains the time of the event,

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:31.070
information about which stock or ticker symbol is traded trade data and quote data.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.314
The trade data is the price and the amount of the transaction.

00:00:35.314 --> 00:00:39.299
The quote data is the price and size of the bid and ask.

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:44.459
A bid is request to buy stock at a price for a set amount of shares.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.140
A ask is the other side of the trade it's the request to

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.910
sell stock at a price for a set amount of shares.

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:58.064
In large marketplaces the number of trades can easily hit 200 trades per second.

00:00:58.064 --> 00:01:02.434
This is a massive amount of data when using historical tech data.

00:01:02.435 --> 00:01:07.555
Analyzing individual texts may not be visible with this much data.

00:01:07.555 --> 00:01:14.145
So, we bucket these texts into equally space time integrals such as minutes or days.

00:01:14.144 --> 00:01:16.429
For each bucket, we can compute

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.005
open high low close prices and total volume of transactions.

00:01:21.004 --> 00:01:25.829
This sort of minute or day level data is much easier to work with.

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:27.649
You have the ability to ignore

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.145
the timestamps and treat the data as equally spaced sequences.

00:01:32.144 --> 00:01:35.914
In some cases, you may still need to use the timestamps.

00:01:35.915 --> 00:01:38.575
But we'll save that for another lesson.

00:01:38.575 --> 00:01:40.299
In the next video,

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:45.000
you will learn about another type of finance data called corporate actions.
