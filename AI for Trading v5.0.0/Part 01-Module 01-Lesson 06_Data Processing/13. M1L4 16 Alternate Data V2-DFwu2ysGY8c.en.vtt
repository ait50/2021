00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.014
Think about all the sources of information we have considered so far,

00:00:05.014 --> 00:00:07.484
market data, corporate actions,

00:00:07.485 --> 00:00:11.410
fundamental information, compositional data.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.574
This is the standard information that everyone uses,

00:00:15.574 --> 00:00:20.054
it's small compared to the amount of data that can affect the market.

00:00:20.054 --> 00:00:24.780
There is useful information all around you to help you predict the market,

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:30.020
information like news articles that have the ability to shape investor opinion,

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.244
social media posts that can convey sentiment towards companies,

00:00:34.244 --> 00:00:37.894
satellite images used to estimate crop yield,

00:00:37.895 --> 00:00:43.730
consumer data that can predict sales and revenue long before official announcements.

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:47.564
You may not see the world through the eyes of a clock right now,

00:00:47.564 --> 00:00:49.265
but once it clicks,

00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:53.344
we hope you'll have a new appreciation for how the world works.

00:00:53.344 --> 00:00:55.600
Until then, enjoy the ride.
