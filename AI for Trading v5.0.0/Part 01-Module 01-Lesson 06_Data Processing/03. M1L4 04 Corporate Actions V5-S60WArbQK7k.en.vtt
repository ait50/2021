00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390
The next set of data we'll talk about is related to

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.455
events a company can take that affects its shareholders.

00:00:07.455 --> 00:00:10.429
This data is called Corporate Actions.

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:15.089
For this lesson, we'll describe only two of the many corporate actions.

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.460
Stock splits and dividends.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.635
Let's start with stock splits.

00:00:19.635 --> 00:00:22.635
On June 2nd, 1998,

00:00:22.635 --> 00:00:26.859
you could buy a share of Amazon for about $85.

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.515
On this date, Amazon decided to perform a two to one stock split.

00:00:31.515 --> 00:00:35.534
Every Amazon shareholder, had their shares doubled.

00:00:35.534 --> 00:00:39.539
This does not mean all of their money in Amazon doubled.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.814
When a stock is split into two,

00:00:41.814 --> 00:00:43.799
its price drops by half.

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:46.804
This makes sure that the total market capitalization

00:00:46.804 --> 00:00:49.789
of a stock has not changed by a split.

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:55.274
Market capitalization is the dollar value of a company's outstanding shares.

00:00:55.274 --> 00:00:57.229
This is calculated by multiplying

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:01.314
the stock price by the total number of shares outstanding.

00:01:01.314 --> 00:01:05.679
In this case, there are twice as many outstanding shares.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.080
To keep the market capitalization the same,

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:12.004
the stock price has to drop by half.

00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:14.739
Why would you ever want to split a stock?

00:01:14.739 --> 00:01:18.334
One reason could be to make the stock more liquid.

00:01:18.334 --> 00:01:21.979
Less expense of stocks are believed to be more liquid.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:28.685
Current shareholders and potential investors can now buy and sell and more granularity.

00:01:28.685 --> 00:01:32.265
This helps maintain a healthy volume of transactions.

00:01:32.265 --> 00:01:36.665
Amazon later went on to have two more stock splits.

00:01:36.665 --> 00:01:40.985
A three-to-one split on January 5th, 1999.

00:01:40.984 --> 00:01:45.060
A two-to-one split on September 2nd of the same year.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.620
The price dropped to roughly one-third and one-half respectively.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.055
I say roughly, because there is still some trading during the day.

00:01:54.055 --> 00:02:00.965
The closing price ends up being a little different from exactly one-third or one-half,

00:02:00.965 --> 00:02:05.015
typically, a little higher due to the renewed interest in the stock.

00:02:05.015 --> 00:02:09.439
If you look at the graph of the stock prices at that time,

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:13.159
you'll notice that the large drops are due to the stock splits.

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:18.169
Looking at this graph makes it look like the company dropped in value.

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:23.454
Using these prices, a computer would read the data the same way.

00:02:23.455 --> 00:02:26.785
However, this is not true.

00:02:26.784 --> 00:02:30.574
The value of the company has not changed from the split.

00:02:30.574 --> 00:02:32.504
How do you correct for this?

00:02:32.504 --> 00:02:37.900
One common approach is to normalize the prices to reduce the sudden changes.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.289
For instance, you could double the stock price after each two-to-one split,

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:47.239
triple after each three-to-one split, and so on.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.680
The trouble with that is,

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.780
your current normalized price will be

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.085
very different from what the stock is actually trading at.

00:02:54.085 --> 00:02:56.780
Instead, we'll do the opposite.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.314
We'll have the price before each two-to-one split,

00:03:00.314 --> 00:03:04.585
turn it into thirds before any three-to-one split, and so on.

00:03:04.585 --> 00:03:09.814
Now, the newest adjusted price matches the price currently on the market.

00:03:09.814 --> 00:03:15.085
Stock prices normalized in this manner is called adjusted price.

00:03:15.085 --> 00:03:19.300
This is typically provided in most historical data sets.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.420
Needless to say, you must keep in mind that this is a distortion of reality.

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:26.554
In June of 1988,

00:03:26.555 --> 00:03:27.890
before the first split,

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:31.399
Amazon was not trading at seven dollars.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.765
It was trading around $85.

00:03:34.764 --> 00:03:42.964
It is the repeated adjustments to historical prices that have reduced 85 to $7.

00:03:42.965 --> 00:03:44.745
With this in mind,

00:03:44.745 --> 00:03:48.870
let's learn about the next corporate action, dividend.
