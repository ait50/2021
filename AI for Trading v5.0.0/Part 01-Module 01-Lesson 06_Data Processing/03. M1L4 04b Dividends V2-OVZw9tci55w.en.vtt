00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.219
The next corporate action we'll talk about is dividend, specifically cash dividends.

00:00:06.219 --> 00:00:08.410
Dividends are when companies share

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.195
some fraction of their profits with their shareholders.

00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:17.594
Let's take a look at Qualcomm which pays out dividends pretty much every quarter.

00:00:17.594 --> 00:00:20.699
On May, 21st of 2017,

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.894
they paid out $0.57 per share.

00:00:23.894 --> 00:00:27.120
However, dividends are given to everyone that hold

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.675
shares in the stock at the time of the payout.

00:00:30.675 --> 00:00:35.195
A shareholder must have bought the share before the ex-dividend date.

00:00:35.195 --> 00:00:40.609
An ex-dividend date is the cutoff point to receive the future dividends.

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:44.844
Let's take a look at an ex-dividend date for AIG.

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:47.780
AIG had announced on February 8th,

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.310
2018 that they will be giving out dividends in the future.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.905
The date the dividends will be given out is March 29th,

00:00:56.905 --> 00:01:03.510
2018, the ex-dividend date is March 14th, 2018.

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:08.239
Whoever held the stock before the state will receive the dividend.

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:11.210
With the basics of dividends out of the way,

00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:14.854
let's go over adjusting the prices to dividends.

00:01:14.855 --> 00:01:19.435
We'll start with why we adjust the prices based on dividends.

00:01:19.435 --> 00:01:25.075
Imagine that you own one share of company A and one share of company B,

00:01:25.075 --> 00:01:27.579
both are worth $50.

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:33.560
The next day is an ex-dividend date of $1 in dividends for company A.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.170
That day, company A closes at $49.50.

00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:42.894
Company B does not have ex-dividend date,

00:01:42.894 --> 00:01:46.289
but also closes at $49.50.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.765
If you only looked at the prices,

00:01:49.765 --> 00:01:53.584
you might think you lost $0.50 on both stocks.

00:01:53.584 --> 00:02:00.839
In reality, you made $0.50 on company A and lost $0.50 on company B.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.960
Just like the stock splits,

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:06.724
we'll normalize the prices to reflect this.

00:02:06.724 --> 00:02:08.870
To get the normalised prices,

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.094
we first need to calculate the adjusted price factor.

00:02:12.094 --> 00:02:18.555
The formula for this is 1+D over S. D is the dividend,

00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:22.365
S is the stock price at ex-dividend date.

00:02:22.365 --> 00:02:24.375
To normalize the price,

00:02:24.375 --> 00:02:27.319
you would divide the historical price by

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.875
the adjusted price factor up until the day before the ex-dividend date.

00:02:32.875 --> 00:02:35.335
With the knowledge you've just learned,

00:02:35.335 --> 00:02:38.730
let's dive into technical indicators.
