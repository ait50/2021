00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
Hi, I'm here with Deven Desai,

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.455
who is a Vertical Lead at Planet,

00:00:04.455 --> 00:00:07.890
a company that is mapping the earth with satellites.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.860
He's here to share a bit about data that can be gathered by

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.570
satellites and how it may be applied in finance and in other industries.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.480
So Deven what do you and your team do at Planet?

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.780
Hey Eddy. Planet's missions are to image the Earth on

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.155
a daily basis and to make it core table or searchable.

00:00:25.155 --> 00:00:28.245
The first mission was achieved recently in 2017

00:00:28.245 --> 00:00:31.845
by building and deploying over 300 satellites statements of the globe.

00:00:31.845 --> 00:00:34.559
Once our team and partners reached this milestone,

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.170
our focus has been on getting our data out there to

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.135
the hands of those who can make good and productive use of it.

00:00:40.135 --> 00:00:44.615
My team focuses on creating solutions for industries from agriculture,

00:00:44.615 --> 00:00:47.045
defense, energy, and beyond to

00:00:47.045 --> 00:00:50.165
take advantage of as the fast amount of remote sensing data.

00:00:50.165 --> 00:00:53.360
Cool. So what is Geospatial and remote

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.690
sensing data and what are some applications of this data?

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.495
Sure, Geospatial data is a broad term

00:00:59.495 --> 00:01:02.585
used to describe terrestrial or geographic datasets.

00:01:02.585 --> 00:01:04.715
This can good attributes such as location,

00:01:04.715 --> 00:01:07.715
which is normally represented by latitude or longitude.

00:01:07.715 --> 00:01:10.400
The types of visible and non-visible wavelengths,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.115
such as red, green, blue, or infrared.

00:01:13.115 --> 00:01:15.725
Additional attributes of the data or resolution,

00:01:15.725 --> 00:01:20.285
which is the amount of area that's covered by each pixel in the image,

00:01:20.285 --> 00:01:22.310
the level of processing done to the data,

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.310
and how closely that data matches to ground truth.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.620
The simplest of examples as mapping,

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.720
because it takes an army of cartographers

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.285
and geographic information systems professionals,

00:01:32.285 --> 00:01:34.580
also known as GIS , professionals,

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.510
around the world to keep maps up to date for both offline and online use.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.400
These maps can either be rest-based,

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.805
meaning there are static pixels representing particular protection,

00:01:43.805 --> 00:01:47.660
or vector-based meaning that they are mathematically defined series of

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.024
line segments and shapes that don't really have any zoom or projection limitations.

00:01:52.024 --> 00:01:56.420
So like the best way to think about this is raster-based images.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.660
If you zoom in, it will start to look blurry and pix-elated.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.045
On the other hand, vector-based images,

00:02:02.045 --> 00:02:04.685
it will still look crisp and clear.

00:02:04.685 --> 00:02:08.240
Digital maps are incredibly hard to make and maintain

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.300
and services like Google Maps, Bing Maps,

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.730
here maps have made a considerable contribution to

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.015
improving their usability for GPS navigation,

00:02:17.015 --> 00:02:22.565
localization or finding that food truck that everyone's been talking about more uniquely.

00:02:22.565 --> 00:02:24.590
Depending on how satellite imagery structured,

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.440
whether it's just the visible spectrum or includes

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.485
non-visible wavelengths determines how it can be used.

00:02:30.485 --> 00:02:32.360
For example, the images can be used to

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.090
analyze the health of crops for the agricultural industry.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.525
Remote sensing data can help us understand better

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:42.830
the current and potential future states of many of the staple crops around the world.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.965
Another example is detecting road construction.

00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:49.970
Detecting road construction for the upstream oil and gas industry is quite

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.085
important since new roads are built

00:02:52.085 --> 00:02:55.490
almost every week in areas like the Permian Basin in US,

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.470
and no one has digitized all of them.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.815
It's literally uncharted territory and this gives

00:03:00.815 --> 00:03:04.399
information and context to do better supply chain logistics,

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:05.960
quicker transport of cruise,

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.425
and also provides economic indicators of exploration activity.

00:03:09.425 --> 00:03:13.065
A similar analysis can also quantify the growth of a city.

00:03:13.065 --> 00:03:15.320
So that's civil government agencies that are allocating

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.335
precious resources throughout a region can do a much better job.

00:03:18.335 --> 00:03:21.905
Well, there are quite a lot of use cases for Geospatial data.

00:03:21.905 --> 00:03:24.815
How can it be used for alpha generation?

00:03:24.815 --> 00:03:28.570
What asset classes are a better fit for this data?

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.830
Generating Alpha from Geospatial data.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.045
It takes a few steps,

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:35.120
but you can't just take a look at a photo of something and then make a

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.225
buy or sell call on a particular security.

00:03:38.225 --> 00:03:40.730
The industry context is quite heavy and it's

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.170
required before you can make a recommendation.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.030
So far, the asset classes that benefit most from

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.164
satellite data analyses tend to revolve around commodities,

00:03:50.164 --> 00:03:53.270
primarily grand futures, as well as oil futures.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.920
Grain futures, on one hand,

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.385
can be much better understood with proper time-series analysis.

00:03:58.385 --> 00:04:01.340
Beyond just helping to create better trading decisions.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.860
This information helps to greatly identify

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.190
the state of food security for a variety of nations around the world.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.610
This information also helps to identify gaps in the market,

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:11.990
which in turn can lead to

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.980
a much faster and accurate adjustment on a price for a particular grain.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.890
Also, monitoring crop health over the course of

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.555
a growing cycle just leads to better judgment on the pricing of crop futures as well.

00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:25.720
For energy commodities, understanding

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.185
oil storage capacity leads to a better judgment on the movement of crude oil futures,

00:04:30.185 --> 00:04:32.315
remote sensing and satellite data analysis.

00:04:32.315 --> 00:04:34.700
It's still a growing space and there are a variety of

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.135
image analytics companies developing solutions for various industries,

00:04:38.135 --> 00:04:39.935
including finance and insurance,

00:04:39.935 --> 00:04:42.440
as well as energy and supply chain sectors.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.120
For instance, beacon and insurance companies

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.600
may use satellite images to assess crop damage,

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.535
forest fires, or floods,

00:04:49.535 --> 00:04:52.250
or to just improve property insurance pricing.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.840
Sounds like geospatial data has a lot of business applications.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.280
What are some skills and techniques that are

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.580
needed for analyzing geospatial and satellite data?

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:07.055
Yeah, the first thing to do is to understand how remote sensing data is produced.

00:05:07.055 --> 00:05:09.260
For example, what's a satellite takes a photo

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.600
and they can sit downlinked via ground station to storage.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.410
That image still needs to have a lot of postprocessing work done to it.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.130
So that ensures that it locks the right location on the ground,

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.930
that the data hasn't been corrupted,

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.905
and that derivative products get produced properly for a specific customer needs,

00:05:24.905 --> 00:05:26.600
among many other things.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.675
Secondly, there are widely used tools like QGIS.

00:05:29.675 --> 00:05:33.155
QGIS and it's an open-source geographic information system tool,

00:05:33.155 --> 00:05:37.220
or ArcGIS, which is a similar application created by the company ESRI.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.070
These tools can also help non-software engineers

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.820
perform a similar analysis on a variety of geospatial data sets.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.980
The more technical experience you have, frankly,

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:50.945
the better prepared you are to analyze and eventually make a more educated decision.

00:05:50.945 --> 00:05:54.500
Recent advancements in machine learning or even distributed computing

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.145
made it much easier to run large-scale statistical analysis.

00:05:58.145 --> 00:06:00.350
In particular, engineers at planet have

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.780
looked at a variety of neural network architectures.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.779
Convolutional neural networks, also called CNN's,

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:07.400
are used for computer vision.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.900
While recurrent neural networks,

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.710
also called RNNs, are used for studying a time series.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.925
The cool thing is that satellite imagery data consists of a time series component.

00:06:16.925 --> 00:06:19.220
We look at neural network architectures.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.845
Second, combine both of these types of networks.

00:06:21.845 --> 00:06:25.880
Mainly the industry has focused on the concept of a special resolution.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.445
As in the amount of pixels, represented,

00:06:28.445 --> 00:06:29.645
an area on the ground,

00:06:29.645 --> 00:06:31.715
something like three meters per pixel.

00:06:31.715 --> 00:06:34.790
Additionally, think of the different wavelength measurements

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:35.855
that we talked about earlier,

00:06:35.855 --> 00:06:37.325
also called spectral bands,

00:06:37.325 --> 00:06:39.080
as their own feature as well.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.510
That is known as radiometric resolution.

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.690
There is also the issue of temporal resolution.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.665
When a satellite gathers data on a particular location of the Earth,

00:06:48.665 --> 00:06:51.275
depending on the orbit configuration and the fleet size,

00:06:51.275 --> 00:06:55.805
it can take as little as a half a day to 14 days to collect another image.

00:06:55.805 --> 00:06:58.910
Temporal resolution refers to the frequency at

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.015
which we can gather data for that same location.

00:07:02.015 --> 00:07:05.150
Unfortunately, it's been a concept for a long time,

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.985
but until recently it wasn't given much attention.

00:07:07.985 --> 00:07:12.815
So Timestamps on that data point or a key feature and remote sensing as well.

00:07:12.815 --> 00:07:15.770
All of this is to say that remote sensing data is

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.605
best to analyzed in a spatiotemporal manner.

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:21.515
In other words, both space and time.

00:07:21.515 --> 00:07:26.300
This makes analyzing remote sensing data both complex and also quite fascinating.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:31.010
So it seems like remote sensing data is quite unique and it helps to build up

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.260
domain knowledge to really understand how to

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.380
build machine learning models using this data.

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:41.450
How do you see the new datasets making a difference in investment analysis?

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:45.575
Also, why is geospatial data and machine learning

00:07:45.575 --> 00:07:50.320
important in analyzing certain industries such as agriculture and energy?

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.370
In terms of investment analysis,

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:55.280
the biggest advantage that surface in the last few years is

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.630
the sheer volume of data generated on a daily basis.

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.980
This creates a double-edged sword though because you have

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.710
so much data and sifting through it takes a lot of time,

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:06.290
proper data collection and annotation techniques will

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:08.960
lead to a cleaner and more succinct training data.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.735
Proper understanding of the problem statement will also make it

00:08:11.735 --> 00:08:14.555
easier to build an appropriate machine-learning model.

00:08:14.555 --> 00:08:16.055
This will lead to a faster,

00:08:16.055 --> 00:08:18.665
more statistically significant analysis.

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:22.895
By this I mean, depending on that business problem your model is being built to solve,

00:08:22.895 --> 00:08:27.110
you may be more or less sensitive to false positives or false negatives.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:31.085
Or you may be requiring accuracy and some use cases.

00:08:31.085 --> 00:08:33.710
Or maybe you are concerned with the speed at which

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:36.500
you can get an approximate answer for that buy, sell decision.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.035
So let's dive a little deeper into the energy sector.

00:08:39.035 --> 00:08:41.960
Let's say I wanted to detect oil well pads or

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.885
reconstruction for a particular sedimentary basin.

00:08:44.885 --> 00:08:47.210
If I'm doing this for a mineral management company

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.940
that wishes to acquire land at the right prices,

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:54.050
I may be willing to tolerate some false positives and the model on the other hand,

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.795
if I'm building a model for an oil field services company,

00:08:56.795 --> 00:08:59.180
they would rely on the well pad and low data to get

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:02.315
their fleets safely from one pad location to another.

00:09:02.315 --> 00:09:04.640
So that would require much higher accuracy and would

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.205
be way less tolerant to false positives.

00:09:07.205 --> 00:09:11.375
This is why domain knowledge is very important depending on the problem,

00:09:11.375 --> 00:09:13.520
that nuance and context will help you build

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:18.140
an appropriate model which properly balances the trade-offs between accuracy,

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.060
training time, compute time,

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.695
and all the parameter modifications,

00:09:21.695 --> 00:09:23.785
among many other design choices.

00:09:23.785 --> 00:09:28.655
That makes sense for the context and business purpose to inform the way

00:09:28.655 --> 00:09:31.160
the model is designed and it really helps to

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.400
build domain knowledge by getting familiar with the data.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.880
So what are some resources that you'd recommend for those who

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.000
want to get some hands-on practice with geospatial data?

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.340
Yeah, there are a variety of resources online to better

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.025
understand the tooling and importance of these datasets.

00:09:46.025 --> 00:09:47.270
There are free, but some weren't.

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:51.245
Coarser resolution datasets from both NASA and the European Space Agency,
