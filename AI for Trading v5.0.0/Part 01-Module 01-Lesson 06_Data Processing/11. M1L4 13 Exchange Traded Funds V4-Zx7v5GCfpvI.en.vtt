00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.070
Let's take a moment to think about what a trading algorithms goal should be.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.880
The obvious part is making money i.e,

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.580
we should try to generate as much positive returns from trading as possible

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.015
but the stock market is inherently very unpredictable as we have already seen.

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:23.969
One approach is to buy stocks that have been showing

00:00:23.969 --> 00:00:29.109
consistent growth and hold onto them for long periods of time.

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.159
This usually generates some returns but nothing

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:38.329
spectacular unless you happen to pick stocks that grow spectacularly.

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.329
But, how you tell ahead of time?

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.710
What if they don't do as well or even fall?

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.990
This inherent risk in the market is very real.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.065
It is as much part of the game as the actual stock prices.

00:00:52.064 --> 00:00:53.724
To mitigate this risk,

00:00:53.725 --> 00:00:59.015
you should maintain a fairly broad portfolio stocks instead of investing a handful.

00:00:59.015 --> 00:01:02.149
How you choose these stocks can affect how much

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.275
your returns are affected by market behavior.

00:01:05.275 --> 00:01:10.480
For instance, you could buy a collection of different technology stocks,

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.215
so the value of your portfolio will go up.

00:01:13.215 --> 00:01:15.855
If there's general growth across the sector,

00:01:15.855 --> 00:01:21.185
you would be somewhat immune to the chance of individual companies failing badly

00:01:21.185 --> 00:01:27.530
or you can bind stocks from different sectors to create a more diverse portfolio.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.465
It will be less sensitive to

00:01:29.465 --> 00:01:34.790
any particular sector but is also not likely to go through the roof.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.560
This is because in order to generate large returns,

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.234
all these sectors will need to perform well together.

00:01:42.234 --> 00:01:48.094
It is much more likely for only some stocks or sectors to perform strongly.

00:01:48.094 --> 00:01:53.359
Which means the average performance of all the other sectors will reduce any such effect.

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:57.155
So, how do you go about picking your basket of stocks?

00:01:57.155 --> 00:02:02.344
You could perform complex statistical analysis to find collections that are likely to

00:02:02.344 --> 00:02:07.465
generate good returns but also reduce the overall risk.

00:02:07.465 --> 00:02:10.425
If you're just investing your personal money,

00:02:10.425 --> 00:02:12.710
this might be too much work.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.650
Not everyone who wants to invest they have

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.094
the knowledge and skills to conduct a proper analysis.

00:02:19.094 --> 00:02:21.710
For this reason, many banks and

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:27.705
other financial institutions offer investment funds which are managed by professionals.

00:02:27.705 --> 00:02:31.820
Mutual funds are one such option which pulling money from

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.288
multiple investors and then buy shares on their behalf.

00:02:36.288 --> 00:02:39.274
You can choose funds according to your investment goals.

00:02:39.275 --> 00:02:41.605
Some are designed to reduce risk,

00:02:41.604 --> 00:02:45.169
yield a lower expected rate of return while others

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:49.250
are configured to give a higher rate of return at increased risk.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.995
Some funds track the performance of specific sectors such as infrastructure,

00:02:54.995 --> 00:03:02.580
technology, communications, et cetera while others may be tied to specific indices.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.475
In addition to combining multiple stocks,

00:03:05.474 --> 00:03:08.844
some funds are traded on stock exchanges themselves.

00:03:08.844 --> 00:03:12.319
That is, in order to invest money in these funds,

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.514
you buy their shares on the market.

00:03:14.514 --> 00:03:18.829
Hence, they are known as Exchange Traded Funds or ETFs.

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.810
They are very popular investments for stock market investors as it tend to produce

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.854
some growth as long as the sector or index they're tracking does well.

00:03:28.854 --> 00:03:31.099
In addition to mitigating risk,

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:36.819
they are also much more economically compared to investing in many stocks individually,

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:38.659
because you typically have to pay

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:42.944
brokerage and other transaction fees on them separately.

00:03:42.944 --> 00:03:46.769
A popular ETF is Standard &amp; Poor's 500 or

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.350
S&amp;P 500 which trades under the ticker symbol SPY.

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:54.400
The S&amp;P 500 include 500 stocks with

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.120
the large market capitalization that trade on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq,

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.305
selected from diverse sectors.

00:04:01.305 --> 00:04:03.849
The composition of an ETF,

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:08.794
the stocks and their proportions can vary over time.

00:04:08.794 --> 00:04:10.989
This gives rise to another source of

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.790
information that can be useful in making trading decisions.

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:17.439
ETF compositional data.

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:23.310
For example, let's say you want to diversify your investment to reduce market risk.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.780
You do that by analyzing the individual performance or correlations between stocks.

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:33.414
This generates a portfolio that is well-balanced and not too correlated.

00:04:33.415 --> 00:04:37.740
If you include ETFs like SPY in your portfolio,

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.980
then there will be some correlation between

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.200
the ETFs and the individual company stocks that they are made up of.

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:49.349
Now, instead of trying to compute these correlations from historic data,

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.800
wouldn't it be better if you had access to the exact proportion of stocks used.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.759
That's precisely what an ETF compositional data provides.

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:03.920
Using this information, you can obtain a much more accurate measure of how correlated

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:09.600
the stocks in a portfolio are and balance them out to further mitigate risks.
