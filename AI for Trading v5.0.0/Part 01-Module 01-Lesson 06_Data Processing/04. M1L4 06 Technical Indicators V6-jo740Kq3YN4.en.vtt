00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.269
So, you have your stock prices adjusted for corporate actions like splits and dividends.

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:09.619
How do you use this information to perform trading?

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:12.614
When you buy, when you sell,

00:00:12.615 --> 00:00:15.080
or even which stocks do you buy or sell.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.059
You can take these decisions based on signals

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:21.339
that can be derived from historical price data.

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:24.379
The first step in this process is to compute

00:00:24.379 --> 00:00:27.765
statistical measures that are called indicators.

00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:33.265
You can think of the raw price of a stock as the most basic kind of indicator.

00:00:33.265 --> 00:00:37.960
Here are the stock prices for Facebook over a one-year period.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.365
The latest price is about $115.

00:00:42.365 --> 00:00:45.885
Is that good? Should we buy some Facebook shares?

00:00:45.884 --> 00:00:47.359
Well, it's not clear.

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:50.119
The price seems to be jumping around a lot and

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:53.204
we don't have a sense of where we should expect to be.

00:00:53.204 --> 00:00:55.259
If we had that,

00:00:55.259 --> 00:01:00.125
then we could check if their current price is significantly higher

00:01:00.125 --> 00:01:05.795
or lower than the expected price and make a decision based on that.

00:01:05.795 --> 00:01:10.085
So, what is the expected price of a stock?

00:01:10.084 --> 00:01:14.125
Is it the average price from when it began trading?

00:01:14.125 --> 00:01:16.730
That seems a little too extreme.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.125
Stocks can grow in orders of magnitude over the years.

00:01:20.125 --> 00:01:23.899
Most current prices will be well over the average.

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:28.594
What might be relevant is the recent average price of the stock.

00:01:28.594 --> 00:01:31.334
Maybe over the past week or month,

00:01:31.334 --> 00:01:34.489
we can extend this idea throughout the history of

00:01:34.489 --> 00:01:39.494
the stock and compute the average of a fixed length window of time.

00:01:39.495 --> 00:01:42.320
It's like moving the window one unit at

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:46.504
a time and taking the average price within that window.

00:01:46.504 --> 00:01:51.494
This is known as the simple moving average or rolling mean.

00:01:51.495 --> 00:01:54.380
We could devise a trading strategy that looks for

00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:57.399
large deviations from the moving average,

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.450
and generate trading signals based on that.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.290
For instance, if a stock falls too far below its average,

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.790
then we should buy it,

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.025
or if it rises too far above,

00:02:09.025 --> 00:02:10.590
then we should sell.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.175
But, how much is too much.

00:02:13.175 --> 00:02:17.689
Using a constant number or a threshold does not seem like a good idea.

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:21.025
Different stocks trade at different price levels.

00:02:21.025 --> 00:02:24.750
We need a measure that is tied to the price of the stock,

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.354
maybe some fraction of the stock price.

00:02:27.354 --> 00:02:30.840
But again, what fraction? We don't know.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.914
Some stocks jump around a lot.

00:02:32.914 --> 00:02:34.625
Some are more stable.

00:02:34.625 --> 00:02:36.844
A better idea might be to compute

00:02:36.844 --> 00:02:40.995
the threshold from the jumpiness or volatility of the stock.

00:02:40.995 --> 00:02:43.420
How about standard deviation?

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:47.794
In fact, we can reuse the windowing idea and compute

00:02:47.794 --> 00:02:52.964
standard deviation over the same fixed length window across time.

00:02:52.965 --> 00:02:55.920
These lines are called Bollinger bands.

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:59.334
All these peaks sticking above the upper band

00:02:59.335 --> 00:03:03.305
are signaling that the stock is trading at a higher price than normal.

00:03:03.305 --> 00:03:08.330
The dips below the lower band are signaling abnormally low price.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.120
One problem that you might notice is that there's too many such points.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.580
We can reduce them by increasing the width of the bands.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.160
That is, by considering a wider range of variation to be normal.

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:28.104
A common threshold is to choose two standard deviations above and below.

00:03:28.104 --> 00:03:30.949
Now, we have far fewer outliers.

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:35.894
But the question remains what do we do with these outlying points?

00:03:35.895 --> 00:03:39.235
Sometimes we get short burst of outliers.

00:03:39.235 --> 00:03:42.450
So, should we buy or sell each of these points?

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:44.144
If you think about it,

00:03:44.145 --> 00:03:47.420
when the price falls below the lower band,

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:52.924
you don't really know if it's going to keep falling or is it going to rise back up.

00:03:52.925 --> 00:03:56.575
Maybe it's wiser to focus on these inflection points.

00:03:56.574 --> 00:04:02.224
When the price is below the lower band and starts to cross back inside towards the mean,

00:04:02.224 --> 00:04:04.199
that should be a good time to buy.

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:07.619
The price is still fairly low and on a rise.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.405
On the other side,

00:04:09.405 --> 00:04:14.090
we can sell when the price crosses down the upper band to the inside.

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.519
This gives us a series of buy and sell signals.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.294
At this point, you must be wondering,

00:04:20.295 --> 00:04:23.980
how much money would I make from following these signals.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.335
Well, that opens up a whole can of worms.

00:04:27.334 --> 00:04:30.649
We'll have to decide how much money you invest to account for

00:04:30.649 --> 00:04:34.304
the brokerage charges and for a few other things.

00:04:34.305 --> 00:04:37.280
Let's just kick this can down the road and

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:40.099
we will look at again when we talk about backtesting.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.625
For now, think about the indicators we just computed.

00:04:43.625 --> 00:04:45.829
Simple moving average and

00:04:45.829 --> 00:04:50.625
standard deviation and the trading signals we derived from them.

00:04:50.625 --> 00:04:52.985
This was a fairly simple approach.

00:04:52.985 --> 00:04:55.670
See if you can compute other indicators and

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.730
better signals from the price and volume data.
