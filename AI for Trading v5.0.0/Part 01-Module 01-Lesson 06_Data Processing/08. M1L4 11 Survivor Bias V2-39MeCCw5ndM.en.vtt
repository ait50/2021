00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.625
The average return from experiment A is indeed higher than from B. Why is that?

00:00:06.625 --> 00:00:10.960
It's due to a phenomenon known as survivor bias or survivorship bias.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.519
If you only picked from the stocks that have survived until today,

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.510
that already filtered out all the other stocks that failed during that period.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.000
Another way to think about experiment A,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.804
is that you essentially traveled forward in time from 2005 to the present day.

00:00:25.804 --> 00:00:27.975
You know then which companies have survived,

00:00:27.975 --> 00:00:31.515
went back and bought from among those stocks.

00:00:31.515 --> 00:00:33.770
Of course you are going to do well,

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.565
but what determines you?

00:00:35.564 --> 00:00:38.530
Experiment B is more honest.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.715
You buy stocks based on information available in 2005.

00:00:42.715 --> 00:00:46.760
No time travel mumbo jumbo and as expected some of

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:50.964
these stocks will fail giving you a lower return on average.

00:00:50.965 --> 00:00:54.170
This is very critical when you're testing the efficiency of

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.260
a trading signal or strategy using historical prices.

00:00:58.259 --> 00:01:01.909
If you allow survivor bias to creep into your analysis,

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:04.144
you will get results that are overly

00:01:04.144 --> 00:01:07.439
optimistic and probably won't work in the real world.
