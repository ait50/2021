00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.118
Let's use the knowledge you took from Marketplace Mechanics,

00:00:04.118 --> 00:00:06.219
and dive deep into the data.

00:00:06.219 --> 00:00:09.644
The data is the most important thing to quantitative analysis.

00:00:09.644 --> 00:00:13.394
Without good data, you don't have good predictions.

00:00:13.394 --> 00:00:18.869
That is sometimes referred to as the garbage in, garbage out principle.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.999
That is the quality of your data directly impacts the quality of your predictions,

00:00:23.998 --> 00:00:26.654
no matter what model you use.

00:00:26.655 --> 00:00:30.750
In this lesson, we'll talk about a few common data sets

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.439
that you'll use and the difficulty with working with that data.
