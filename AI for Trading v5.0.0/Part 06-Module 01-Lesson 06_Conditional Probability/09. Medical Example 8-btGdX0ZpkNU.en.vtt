00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And the result, once again, is found in the truth table,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
which is why this table is so powerful.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Let's look at where in the truth table we get a positive test result.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I would say it is right here,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
right here.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If you take corresponding probabilities of

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
0.09 and 0.18,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and add them up,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
we get 0.27,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.693
and that's the correct answer for getting a positive result.
