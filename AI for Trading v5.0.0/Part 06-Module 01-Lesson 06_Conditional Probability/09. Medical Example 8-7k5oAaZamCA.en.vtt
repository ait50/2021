00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now let me ask you a really tricky question.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
What is the probability of a positive test result?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Can you sum or determine,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
irrespective of whether there's cancer or not,

00:00:10.000 --> 99:59:59.000
what is the probability you get a positive test result?
