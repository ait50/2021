00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This is a non-trivial question,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and the right way to do this is to go through the truth table,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
which I've drawn over here.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
There's 3 different things happening.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We've taken initial pick of the coin,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
which can take coin 1 or coin 2 with equal probability,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and then you go flip it for the first time,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and there's heads or tails outcomes,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and we flip it for the second time with the second outcome.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So these different cases summarize my truth table.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I now need to observe just the cases where

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
head is followed by tail.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
This one right here and over here.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Then we compute the probability for those 2 cases.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The probability of picking coin 1 is 0.5.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
For the fair coin, we get 0.5 for heads,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
followed by 0.5 for tails.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
They're together is 0.125.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Let's do it with the second case.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
There's a 0.5 chance of taking coin 2.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Now that one comes up with heads at 0.9.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It comes up with tails at 0.1.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So multiply these together, gives us 0.045,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
a smaller number than up here.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Adding these 2 things together results in 0.17,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
which is the right answer

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
to the question over here.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
That was really non-trivial,

00:01:20.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and I'd be amazed if you got this correct.
