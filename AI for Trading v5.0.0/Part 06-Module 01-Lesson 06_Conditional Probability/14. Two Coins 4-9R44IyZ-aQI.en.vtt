00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And the answer is depressing.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
If you, once again, draw the truth table,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
you find, for the different combinations,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
that if you've drawn coin 1,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
you'd never see tails.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So this case over here, which indeed has tails, tails.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We have 0 probability.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We can work this out probability of drawing the first coin at 0.5,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but the probability of tails given the first coin

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
must be 0, because the probability of heads is 1,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
so 0.5 times 0 times 0,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
that is 0.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So the only case where you might see tails/tails is

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
when you actually drew coin 2,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and this has a probability of

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
0.5 times the probability of tails

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
given that we drew the second coin,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
which is 0.4 times 0.4 again,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and that's the same as 0.08

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
would have been the correct answer.
