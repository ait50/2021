00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Of course, in reality, we don't know whether a person suffers cancer,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
but we can run a test like a blood test.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The outcome of it blood test may be positive or negative, but like any good test,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
it tells me something about the thing I really care about--whether the person has cancer or not.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Let's say, if the person has the cancer, the test comes up positive with the probability of 0.9,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and that implies if the person has cancer, the negative outcome will have 0.1 probability

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and that's because these two things have to add to 1.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I've just given you a fairly complicated notation that says the outcome of the test depends

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
on whether the person has cancer or not.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
That is more complicated than everything else we've talked about so far.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We call this thing over here a conditional probability,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and the way to understand this is a very funny notation.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
There's a bar in the middle, and the bar says what's the probability of the stuff on the left

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
given that we assume the stuff on the right is actually the case.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Now, in reality, we don't know whether the person has cancer or not, and in a later unit,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
we're going to reason about whether the person has cancer given a certain data set,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
but for now, we assume we have god-like capabilities.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
We can tell with absolute certainty that the person has cancer,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and we can determine what the outcome of the test is.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
This is a test that isn't exactly deterministic--it makes mistakes,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
but it only makes a mistake in 10% of the cases, as illustrated by the 0.1 down here.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Now, it turns out, I haven't fully specified the test.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
The same  test might also be applied to a situation where the person does not have cancer.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So this little thing over here is my shortcut of not having cancer.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And now, let me say the probability of the test giving me a positive results--a false positive result

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
when there's no cancer is 0.2.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
You can now tell me what's the probability of a negative outcome in case

00:02:18.000 --> 99:59:59.000
we know for a fact the person doesn't have cancer, so please tell me.
