00:00:00.056 --> 00:00:01.663
And letâ€™s do the truth table.

00:00:01.663 --> 00:00:04.265
You have a pick event followed by a flip event

00:00:04.265 --> 00:00:07.689
We can pick coin 1 or coin 2.

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:10.631
There is a 0.5 chance for each of the coins.

00:00:10.631 --> 00:00:12.693
Then we can flip and get heads

00:00:12.693 --> 00:00:15.057
or tails for the coin we've chosen.

00:00:15.057 --> 00:00:16.850
Now what are the probabilities?

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.884
I'd argue picking 1 at 0.5

00:00:19.884 --> 00:00:22.500
and once I pick the fair coin, I know

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.201
that the probability of heads is, once again, 0.5

00:00:26.201 --> 00:00:28.368
which makes it 0.25

00:00:28.368 --> 00:00:31.071
The same is true for picking the fair coin

00:00:31.071 --> 00:00:33.641
and expecting tails

00:00:33.641 --> 00:00:37.442
but as we pick the unfair coin with a 0.5 chance

00:00:37.442 --> 00:00:40.114
we get a 0.9 chance of heads

00:00:40.114 --> 00:00:44.837
So 0.5 times 0.95 gives you 0.45

00:00:44.837 --> 00:00:49.129
whereas the unfair coin, the probability of tails is 0.1

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.744
multiply by the probability of picking it at 0.5 gives us 0.05

00:00:54.744 --> 00:00:57.746
Now when they ask you, what's the probability of heads

00:00:57.746 --> 00:01:01.412
we'll find that 2 of those cases indeed come up with heads

00:01:01.412 --> 00:01:07.094
so if you add 0.25 and 0.45 and we get 0.7.

00:01:07.094 --> 00:01:10.584
So this example is a 0.7 chance

00:01:10.584 --> 00:01:14.000
that we might generate heads.
