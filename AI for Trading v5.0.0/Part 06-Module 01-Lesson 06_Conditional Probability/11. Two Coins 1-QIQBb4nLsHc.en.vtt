00:00:00.184 --> 00:00:02.649
This time around, we have a bag,

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:06.386
and in the bag are 2 coins,coin 1 and coin 2.

00:00:06.417 --> 00:00:10.358
And in advance, we know that coin 1 is fair.

00:00:10.358 --> 00:00:15.057
So P of coin 1 of coming up heads is 0.5

00:00:15.057 --> 00:00:19.589
whereas coin 2 is loaded, that is, P of coin 2

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:22.993
coming up heads is 0.9.

00:00:22.993 --> 00:00:26.275
Quickly, give me the following numbers

00:00:26.275 --> 00:00:28.542
of the probability of coming up tails

00:00:28.542 --> 00:00:31.296
for coin 1 and for coin 2.
