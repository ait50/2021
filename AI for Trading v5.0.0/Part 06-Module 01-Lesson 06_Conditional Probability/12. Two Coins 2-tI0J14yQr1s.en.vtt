00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.574
So now what happens is, I'm going to

00:00:02.574 --> 00:00:05.311
remove one of the coins from this bag,

00:00:05.311 --> 00:00:08.166
and each coin, coin 1 or coin 2,

00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:10.856
is being picked with equal probability.

00:00:10.856 --> 00:00:13.332
Let me now flip that coin once,

00:00:13.332 --> 00:00:15.679
and I want you to tell me,

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:17.769
what's the probability that this coin

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:21.532
which could be 50% chance fair coin

00:00:21.532 --> 00:00:24.110
and 50% chance a loaded coin.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.360
What's the probability that this coin comes up heads?

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.814
Again, this is an exercise in conditional probability.
