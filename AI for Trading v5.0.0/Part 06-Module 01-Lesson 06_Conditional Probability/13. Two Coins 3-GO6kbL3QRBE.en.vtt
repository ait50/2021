00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now let me up the ante by flipping this coin twice.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Once again, I'm drawing a coin from this bag,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and I pick one at 50% chance.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I don't know which one I have picked.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It might be fair or loaded.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And in flipping it twice,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I get first heads,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and then tails.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
What's the probability that if I do the following,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I draw a coin at random with the probabilities shown,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and then I flip it twice, that same coin.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I just draw it once and then flip it twice.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
What's the probability of seeing heads first

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and then tails?

00:00:34.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Again, you might derive this using truth tables.
