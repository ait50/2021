00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Putting all of this into mathematical notation

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
we've given the probability of having cancer

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and from there, it follows the probability of not having cancer.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And they give me 2 conditional probability

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that are the test being positive.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
If we have have cancer, from which we can now predict the probability

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
of the test being negative of having cancer.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And the probability of the test being positive can be cancer free

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
which can complete the probability of

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
a negative test result in the cancer-free case.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So these things are just easily inferred

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
by the 1 minus rule.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Then when we read this,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
you complete the probability of a positive test result

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
as the sum of

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
a positive test result given cancer

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
times the probability of cancer,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
which is our truth table entry for the combination of P and C

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
plus the same given we don't have of cancer.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Now this notation is confusing and complicated

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
if we ever dive deep into probability, that's called

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
total probability,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
but it's useful to know that this is

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
very, very intuitive

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and to further develop intuition let me just give you

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.545
another exercise of exactly the same type.
