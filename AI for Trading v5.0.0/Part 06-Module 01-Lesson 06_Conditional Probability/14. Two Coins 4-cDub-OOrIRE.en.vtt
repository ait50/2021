00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let me do this once again.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
There are 2 coins in the bag,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
coin 1 and coin 2.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And as before, taking coin 1 at 0.5 probability.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
But now I'm telling you

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that coin 1 is loaded, so give you heads with probability of 1.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Think of it as a coin that only has heads.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And coin 2 is also loaded.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It gives you heads with 0.6 probability.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Now work out for me into this experiment,

00:00:31.000 --> 99:59:59.000
what's the probability of seeing tails twice?
