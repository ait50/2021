00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So there're important lessons in what we just learned,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
the key thing is we talked about conditional probabilities.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We said that the outcome in a variable, like a test

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
is actually not like the random coin flip

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but it depends on something else,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
like a disease.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
When we looked at this,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
we were able to predict

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
what's the probability of a test outcome

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
even if we don't know whether the person has a disease or not.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And we did this using the truth table,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and in the truth table,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
we summarized multiple lines.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
For example, we multiplied the probability of a test outcome

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
condition on this unknown variable,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
whether the person is diseased

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
multiplied by the probability of the disease being present.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Then we added a second row of the truth table,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
where our unobserved disease variable

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
took the opposite value of not diseased.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Written this way, it looks really clumsy,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
but that's effectively what we did when we went to the truth table.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So we now understand that certain coin flips

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
are dependent on other coin flips,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
so if god, for example, flips the coin of us having a disease or not,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
then the medical test again

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
has a random outcome,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
but its probability really depends on whether we have the disease or not.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
We have to consider this when we do probabilistic inference.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
In the next unit,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
we're going to ask the real question.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Say we really care about whether we have a disease like cancer or not.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
What do you think the probability is,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
given that our doctor

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
just gave us a positive test result?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And I can tell you,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
you will be in for a surprise.
