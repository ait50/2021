00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.500
In real life, events often depend on each other.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.410
Say you can be an early bird or night owl.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.214
And for the sake of simplicity,

00:00:12.214 --> 00:00:15.379
let's assume there's a 50 percent chance for each one.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.580
Now whether you decide to go for a run at 5:00 a.m. tomorrow is not entirely independent.

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:24.939
I would argue that going for a run at 5:00 a.m. is not likely for most people.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:30.140
But it is certainly more likely for individuals who are actually awake at that hour.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.385
If you're an early bird,

00:00:31.385 --> 00:00:34.023
the probability might be a two percent chance,

00:00:34.023 --> 00:00:35.135
while if you're a night owl,

00:00:35.134 --> 00:00:37.199
the probability might be zero.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.390
You can think of these events as two consecutive coin flips.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.850
The first coin determines whether you're an early bird,

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.935
and the second coin is only flipped given that you are an early bird,

00:00:49.935 --> 00:00:52.585
and it determines if you go for the run.

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:55.460
We are no longer observing independent events,

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.020
like we did in the last lesson,

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.105
where the outcome of the first coin flip didn't affect the outcome of the second.

00:01:02.104 --> 00:01:03.544
Starting with this lesson,

00:01:03.545 --> 00:01:06.320
we're going to look at case studies where the outcome of the

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:09.139
first does impact the outcome of the second.
