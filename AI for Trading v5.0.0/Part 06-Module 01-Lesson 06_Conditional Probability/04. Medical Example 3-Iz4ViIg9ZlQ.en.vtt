00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Look at this, this is very nontrivial but armed with this,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
we can now build up the truth table for all the cases of the two different variables,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
cancer and non-cancer and positive and negative tests outcome.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So, let me write down cancer and test and let me go through different possibilities.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We could have cancer or not, and the test may come up positive or negative.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So, please give me the probability of the combination of those for the very first one,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and as a hint, it's kind of the same as before where we multiply two things,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
but you have to find the right things to multiple in this table over here.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
This is not an easy question.
