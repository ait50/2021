00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
Welcome to Natural Language Processing.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.110
Language is an important medium for human communication.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.179
It allows us to convey information,

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.525
express our ideas, and give instructions to others.

00:00:13.525 --> 00:00:16.170
Some philosophers argue that it enables

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.620
us to form complex thoughts and reason about them.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.184
It may turn out to be a critical component of human intelligence.

00:00:24.184 --> 00:00:28.315
Now consider the various artificial systems we interact with every day,

00:00:28.315 --> 00:00:32.420
phones, cars, websites, coffee machines.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.944
It's natural to expect them to be able to process and understand human language, right?

00:00:37.944 --> 00:00:41.810
Yet, computers are still lagging behind.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.950
No doubt, we have made

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.219
some incredible progress in the field of natural language processing,

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.240
but there is still a long way to go.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.880
And that's what makes this an exciting and dynamic area of study.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.939
In this lesson you will not only get to know

00:00:57.939 --> 00:01:01.409
more about the applications and challenges in NLP,

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:04.988
you will learn how to design an intelligent application that

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.609
uses NLP techniques and deploy it on a scalable platform.

00:01:09.608 --> 00:01:12.000
Sounds fun? Let's get started.
