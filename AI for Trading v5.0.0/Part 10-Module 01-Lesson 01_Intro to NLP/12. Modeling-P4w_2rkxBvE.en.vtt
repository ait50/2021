00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
The final stage in this process is what I like to call modeling.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.850
This includes designing a model,

00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:10.035
usually a statistical or a machine learning model,

00:00:10.035 --> 00:00:15.240
fitting its parameters to training data using an optimization procedure,

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.009
and then using it to make predictions about unseen data.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.220
The nice thing about working with numerical features is that

00:00:23.219 --> 00:00:26.984
it allows you to utilize pretty much any machine learning model.

00:00:26.984 --> 00:00:30.089
This includes support vector machines, decision trees,

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:34.229
neural networks, or any custom model of your choice.

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:38.069
You could even combine multiple models to get better performance.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.234
How you utilize the model is up to you.

00:00:41.234 --> 00:00:43.950
You can deploy it as a web-based application,

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.875
package it up into a handy mobile app,

00:00:46.875 --> 00:00:49.335
integrate it with other products,

00:00:49.335 --> 00:00:51.274
services, and so on.

00:00:51.274 --> 00:00:53.219
The possibilities are endless.
