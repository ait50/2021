00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
Natural language processing is one of the fastest growing fields in the world.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.845
NLP Is making its way into a number of products and services that we use every day.

00:00:09.845 --> 00:00:15.830
Let's begin with an overview of how to design an end-to-end NLP pipeline.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.059
Not that kind of pipeline;

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:20.820
a natural language processing pipeline,

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.144
where you start with raw text,

00:00:23.144 --> 00:00:26.054
in whatever form it is available, process it,

00:00:26.054 --> 00:00:32.265
extract relevant features, and build models to accomplish various NLP tasks.

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:33.865
Now that I think about it,

00:00:33.865 --> 00:00:35.940
that is kind of like refining crude oil.

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:41.094
Anyways, you'll learn how these different stages in the pipeline depend on each other.

00:00:41.094 --> 00:00:43.604
You'll also learn how to make design decisions,

00:00:43.604 --> 00:00:45.674
how to choose existing libraries,

00:00:45.674 --> 00:00:47.489
and tools to perform each step.
