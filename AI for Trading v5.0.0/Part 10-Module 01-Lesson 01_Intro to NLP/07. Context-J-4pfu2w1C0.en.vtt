00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.019
So what is stopping computers from becoming as capable

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.439
as humans in understanding natural language?

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.300
Part of the problem lies in the variability and complexity of our sentences.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.210
Consider this excerpt from a movie review.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.000
"I was lured to see this on the promise of

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.054
a smart witty slice of old fashioned fun and intrigue. I was conned. "

00:00:23.053 --> 00:00:24.538
Although it starts with

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.059
some potentially positive words it turns out to be a strongly negative review.

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:32.908
Sentences like this might be somewhat entertaining for

00:00:32.908 --> 00:00:37.839
us but computers tend to make mistakes when trying to analyze them.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.670
But there is a bigger challenge that makes NLP harder than you think.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.054
Take a look at this sentence.

00:00:45.054 --> 00:00:49.935
"The sofa didn't fit through the door because it was too narrow."

00:00:49.935 --> 00:00:52.164
What does "it" refer to?

00:00:52.164 --> 00:00:55.515
Clearly "it" refers to the door.

00:00:55.515 --> 00:00:58.975
Now consider a slight variation of this sentence.

00:00:58.975 --> 00:01:03.109
"The sofa didn't fit through the door because it was too wide."

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:05.819
What does "it" refer to in this case?

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:08.950
Here it's the sofa. Think about it.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.859
To understand the proper meaning or semantics of

00:01:11.858 --> 00:01:16.583
the sentence you implicitly applied your knowledge about the physical world,

00:01:16.584 --> 00:01:20.230
that wide things don't fit through narrow things.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.635
You may have experienced a similar situation before.

00:01:23.635 --> 00:01:28.689
You can imagine that there are countless other scenarios in which some knowledge or

00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:34.000
context is indispensable for correctly understanding what is being said.
