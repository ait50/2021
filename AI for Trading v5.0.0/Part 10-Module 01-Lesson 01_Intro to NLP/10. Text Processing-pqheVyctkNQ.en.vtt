00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
Let's take a closer look at text processing.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.233
The first question that comes to mind is,

00:00:06.232 --> 00:00:08.550
why do we need to process text?

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.740
Why can we not feed it in directly?

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.125
To understand that, think about where we get this text to begin with.

00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:20.295
Websites are a common source of textual information.

00:00:20.295 --> 00:00:26.345
Here's a portion of a sample web page from Wikipedia and the corresponding HTML markup,

00:00:26.344 --> 00:00:28.489
which serves as our raw input.

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:31.494
For the purpose of natural language processing,

00:00:31.495 --> 00:00:36.245
you would typically want to get rid of all or most of the HTML tags,

00:00:36.244 --> 00:00:38.984
and retain only plain text.

00:00:38.984 --> 00:00:44.894
You can also remove or set aside any URLs or other items not relevant to your task.

00:00:44.895 --> 00:00:50.440
The Web is probably the most common and fastest growing source of textual content.

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:53.064
But you may also need to consume PDFs,

00:00:53.064 --> 00:00:55.704
Word documents or other file formats.

00:00:55.704 --> 00:00:58.000
Or your raw input may even come from

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.679
a speech recognition system or from a book scan using OCR.

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:07.305
Some knowledge of the source medium can help you properly handle the input.

00:01:07.305 --> 00:01:11.650
In the end, your goal is to extract plain text that is free of

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.185
any source specific markers or constructs that are not relevant to your task.

00:01:17.185 --> 00:01:19.359
Once you have obtained plain text,

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:22.000
some further processing may be necessary.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.840
For instance, capitalization doesn't usually change the meaning of a word.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.030
We can convert all the words to the same case so that they're not treated differently.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.799
Punctuation marks that we use to indicate pauses, etc.

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.664
can also be removed.

00:01:37.665 --> 00:01:41.245
Some common words in a language often help provide structure,

00:01:41.245 --> 00:01:43.350
but don't add much meaning.

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:45.429
For example, a, and,

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.370
the, of, are, and so on.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.640
Sometimes it's best to remove them if that helps

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.000
reduce the complexity of the procedures you want to apply later.
