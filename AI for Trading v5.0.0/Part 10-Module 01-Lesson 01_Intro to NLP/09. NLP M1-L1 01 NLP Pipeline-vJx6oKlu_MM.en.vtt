00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.490
Let's look at a common NLP pipeline.

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:05.730
It consists of three stages,

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.975
text processing, feature extraction and modeling.

00:00:09.974 --> 00:00:15.929
Each stage transforms text in some way and produces a result that the next stage needs.

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.507
For example, the goal of text processing is to take raw input text,

00:00:20.507 --> 00:00:22.379
clean it, normalize it,

00:00:22.379 --> 00:00:26.714
and convert it into a form that is suitable for feature extraction.

00:00:26.714 --> 00:00:32.460
Similarly, the next stage needs to extract and produce feature representations that are

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.950
appropriate for that type of model you're planning to

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.535
use and the NLP task you're trying to accomplish.

00:00:38.534 --> 00:00:40.661
When you're building such a pipeline,

00:00:40.661 --> 00:00:43.530
your workflow may not be perfectly linear.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.295
Let's say, you spend some time implementing text processing functions,

00:00:47.295 --> 00:00:50.024
then make some simple feature extractors,

00:00:50.024 --> 00:00:53.094
and then design a baseline statistical model.

00:00:53.094 --> 00:00:55.865
But then, maybe you are not happy with the results.

00:00:55.865 --> 00:00:58.829
So you go back and rethink what features you need,

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.104
and that in turn,

00:01:00.104 --> 00:01:02.909
can make you change your processing routines.

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:07.530
Keep in mind that this is a very simplified view of natural language processing.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.000
Your application may require additional steps.
