Our first section will be taught by Arpan Chakraborty.

00:00:02.865 --> 00:00:05.610
Arpan has a Ph.D. in Computer Science and for several years,

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.460
has taught at Udacity and at Georgia Tech. Hi Arpan.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.560
Hi Luis. Hello everyone.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.519
I'm glad to get you started on your journey through Natural Language Processing.

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.489
Everything in NLP starts with raw text typically,

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:21.070
produced by humans like you and me, and Luis here.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.230
This text is first processed using some simple transformations such as,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.300
splitting it into individual words,

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.955
reducing verbs to their root form, et cetera.

00:00:29.954 --> 00:00:35.129
You need to do this before performing any other analysis or training complex models.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.710
This stage may sound simple but you have to be

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.230
careful about how you process your raw text.

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:46.119
It may affect the results you obtain further down the line. Ready? Let's do it.
