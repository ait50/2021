00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
We can also decompose portfolio return,

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.599
also called P&amp;L or profit and loss.

00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:13.214
If we sum up the asset returns in a weighted sum using the holdings vector as weights,

00:00:13.214 --> 00:00:17.204
we have the portfolio P&amp;L for one time period.

00:00:17.204 --> 00:00:23.174
Let's substitute in the multifactor model expression for r. Here,

00:00:23.175 --> 00:00:27.945
we can substitute the exposure vector in for h transpose B.

00:00:27.945 --> 00:00:31.949
We again see that there's a term in this expression due to

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.350
the idiosyncratic component and terms due to each factor.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.490
All we are saying in this expression is that

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.090
the portfolio profit and loss can be accounted for by

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.210
the part of the P&amp;L due to factors and

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.664
the remaining piece which covers what isn't explained by any factors.

00:00:51.664 --> 00:00:53.909
Note that in this expression,

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:59.599
we assume that the sum over factors is over both risk and Alpha factors.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.734
So although in previous parts of the course,

00:01:02.734 --> 00:01:09.349
we left the Alpha factors out of the exposure and factor return matrices B and f,

00:01:09.349 --> 00:01:11.584
here we include them.

00:01:11.584 --> 00:01:13.444
So in the sum,

00:01:13.444 --> 00:01:17.449
a few of the E and f terms represent the Alpha factors,

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.344
and the others represent the risk factors.

00:01:20.344 --> 00:01:25.159
However, we expect the contribution to the P&amp;L from risk factors to be

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.920
minimal because we designed our portfolio to

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.445
have as little exposure as possible to risk factors.

00:01:31.444 --> 00:01:37.204
The ability to decompose portfolio P&amp;L in this way can be very powerful.

00:01:37.204 --> 00:01:43.054
The idiosyncratic term can be considered to be explained by individual stock selection.

00:01:43.055 --> 00:01:46.100
This term will be large if the stocks chosen have

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:50.949
large idiosyncratic return or return unexplained by the factors.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.895
The portfolio P&amp;L may enlarge part B attributable to exposures to factors,

00:01:56.894 --> 00:02:01.299
and this is where the performance attribution can be especially illuminating.

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.369
For example, a portfolio manager might think

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.715
that their superior returns are due to stock selection

00:02:07.715 --> 00:02:11.150
when in reality their research process is leading them

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.808
to stocks with large exposures to the market or momentum,

00:02:14.808 --> 00:02:18.349
and it could be that after controlling for these effects,

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.069
the value add is zero or negative.

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:27.109
However, you should probably think of this expression as ideal P&amp;L in the sense that it's

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.570
what we'd earn if we could execute at

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.245
the midpoint price at the time the order was constructed.

00:02:33.245 --> 00:02:36.094
This could be very inaccurate because it doesn't take

00:02:36.094 --> 00:02:40.009
into account the impact our trades had on the market.
