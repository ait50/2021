00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.265
Let's say we have a portfolio.

00:00:02.265 --> 00:00:04.830
That means we've calculated a holdings vector.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.169
So we have a vector that tells us how much money we want to invest in each asset.

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:15.585
The holdings vector is an n-dimensional vector with one value for each company.

00:00:15.585 --> 00:00:21.344
If we take the dot product of the holdings vector and each factor exposure vector,

00:00:21.344 --> 00:00:26.820
we have what we call the exposure of the portfolio to each factor.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.469
If we put these values in a vector,

00:00:29.469 --> 00:00:33.484
we have what we call the exposure vector of the portfolio.

00:00:33.484 --> 00:00:38.990
Each of these values represents the portfolio's exposure to a single factor.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.770
We can write what we just did in the following way as

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.350
the transpose of the factor exposure matrix times the holdings vector.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.890
Now, we have the exposures of the portfolio to each factor.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.590
That is to say, the exposure vector.
