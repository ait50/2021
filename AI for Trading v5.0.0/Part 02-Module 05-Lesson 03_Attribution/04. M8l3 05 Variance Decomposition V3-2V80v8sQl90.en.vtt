00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
When we've described our portfolio in terms of several factors,

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.299
we can also use that information to decompose

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.109
the portfolio risk in terms of the risk due to these factors,

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:13.004
and the idiosyncratic risk due to the error term.

00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:16.500
Let's start with the expression for the portfolio variance.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.509
First, we write down the variance of the asset returns in terms of the factors.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.410
You'll recognize this expression from previous lessons.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.280
Then we multiply by the holdings vector on either side.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.399
This is now the variance of our portfolio.

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.589
We can take the holdings vector inside the parentheses.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.280
We also see that the combination of the holdings vector and

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.460
the factor matrix is the portfolio exposure vector.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.899
Now, we see that the portfolio variance is the sum of two terms.

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.945
One is the idiosyncratic variance,

00:00:50.945 --> 00:00:53.825
and the other is due to the factors.

00:00:53.825 --> 00:00:57.200
If we divide the expression by the total variance,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.760
we get what we call a variance decomposition.

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:07.579
Note that the factor covariance matrix times the exposure vector is itself a vector.

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:10.444
So that quantity times the exposure vector

00:01:10.444 --> 00:01:13.254
is like a weighted sum of terms for each factor,

00:01:13.254 --> 00:01:16.474
with the elements of the exposure vector as weights.

00:01:16.474 --> 00:01:20.659
We'll expand out the vector matrix multiplication of

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.289
the exposure vector and the factor covariance matrix a little,

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.130
so that we can see the sum over factors.

00:01:27.129 --> 00:01:30.259
Now, there's a term for each factor

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.190
and a term for the idiosyncratic variants which sum to one.

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:39.364
This expression makes the relative contributions of different terms easier to interpret.

00:01:39.364 --> 00:01:43.324
Note that the idiosyncratic variance term is never negative,

00:01:43.325 --> 00:01:46.710
but the variance contribution from a factor can be negative,

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:49.099
if the factor is acting as a hedge and

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:52.629
reducing variants caused by exposure to other factors.

00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:54.765
Note that in this expression,

00:01:54.765 --> 00:02:00.694
we assume that the sum over factors is over both risk and Alpha factors.

00:02:00.694 --> 00:02:03.769
So although in previous parts of the course,

00:02:03.769 --> 00:02:08.750
we left the Alpha factors out of the exposure and factor return matrices,

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.479
B, which is wrapped up in E and F. Here, we include them.

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:18.289
So in the sum, a few of the terms in the sum over I

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:23.280
represent the Alpha factors and the others represent the risk factors.
