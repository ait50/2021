00:00:02.049 --> 00:00:05.629
This concludes this lesson on confidence intervals.

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:09.250
You've learned a ton about how you can build and interpret confidence intervals.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.640
In the next lesson,

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.790
you will learn another technique that's very

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:16.894
similar to confidence intervals called hypothesis testing.

00:00:16.894 --> 00:00:22.285
The topics of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing essentially do the same thing.

00:00:22.285 --> 00:00:26.083
But depending on who you talk to or what source you're reading from,

00:00:26.083 --> 00:00:28.199
it's important to understand both.

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.070
With that, check out the recap on this lesson on

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.090
the next concept and let's get ready for hypothesis testing.
