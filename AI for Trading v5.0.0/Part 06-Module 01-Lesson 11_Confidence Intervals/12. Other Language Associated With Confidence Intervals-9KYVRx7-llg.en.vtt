00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:07.339
In this video, you'll learn a few more terms associated with confidence intervals,

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:11.269
as well as some of the relationships you can expect between what happens to

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:13.549
the inputs of a confidence interval and how

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.193
this affects the interval you get as a result.

00:00:16.193 --> 00:00:21.179
There are a few terms that we should discuss that are true for any confidence interval.

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:23.689
In the literature, you will frequently see terms

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.155
like the margin of error and the confidence interval width.

00:00:27.155 --> 00:00:31.628
A common way that we see political results is in the following way.

00:00:31.628 --> 00:00:36.799
Candidate A has 34 percent of the vote plus or minus 3 percent.

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:41.589
And Candidate B has 22 percent of the vote plus or minus 3 percent.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.890
Then in small print,

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.375
you might see something like,

00:00:44.375 --> 00:00:47.704
"These figures are based on the 95 percent confidence interval."

00:00:47.704 --> 00:00:53.629
In the sample, each candidate has this respective 34 and 22 percent,

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.935
and this 3 percent is called the margin of error.

00:00:56.935 --> 00:00:59.542
In order to build a confidence interval,

00:00:59.542 --> 00:01:02.304
we actually add and subtract this amount.

00:01:02.304 --> 00:01:05.510
So our confidence interval for the true proportion that Candidate A

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.375
controls for the population is at 31 to 37 percent,

00:01:10.375 --> 00:01:14.769
and for Candidate B, it would be 19 to 25 percent.

00:01:14.769 --> 00:01:19.129
If this confidence interval for each is larger than we want it,

00:01:19.129 --> 00:01:21.854
we could actually collect a larger sample size.

00:01:21.855 --> 00:01:24.340
Because of the Law of Large Numbers,

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.359
we know that the larger the sample size,

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:31.655
the better our estimates will be at approximating our parameter and therefore,

00:01:31.655 --> 00:01:33.349
this will narrow our interval.
