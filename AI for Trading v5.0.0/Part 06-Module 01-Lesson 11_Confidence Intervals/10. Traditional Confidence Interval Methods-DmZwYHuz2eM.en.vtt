00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:06.199
The way we've been building confidence intervals thus far is

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.070
based on bootstrapping and our knowledge of sampling distributions.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.919
This is an extremely effective method for building

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:17.230
confidence intervals for essentially any parameters we might be interested in.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.839
However, if you've taken a statistics course elsewhere,

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:22.370
you might be confused as to why

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.445
this notation is different than what you've done in those other courses.

00:00:26.445 --> 00:00:31.879
You might have seen equations like these for capturing a population mean or proportion.

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:35.149
Similarly, you might have seen equations like these for

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.159
capturing the difference in means or the difference in proportions.

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:44.884
All of these formulas have underlying assumptions that may or may not be true.

00:00:44.884 --> 00:00:50.344
If you truly believe that your data are representative of your population of interest,

00:00:50.344 --> 00:00:53.045
the bootstrapping method should provide

00:00:53.045 --> 00:00:56.899
a better representation for where the parameter is likely to be.

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.494
However, with large enough sample sizes,

00:00:59.494 --> 00:01:01.519
these formulas should provide

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.555
very similar results to those that we've seen in bootstrapping methods.

00:01:05.555 --> 00:01:09.000
In the next concept, we'll take a look at a few examples.
