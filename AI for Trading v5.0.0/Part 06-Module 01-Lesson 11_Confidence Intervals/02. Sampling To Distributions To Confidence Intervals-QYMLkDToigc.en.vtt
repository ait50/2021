00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.679
In the previous lesson,

00:00:04.679 --> 00:00:07.259
you saw how we can do sampling distributions and

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.669
bootstrapping to understand the values of a statistic that are possible.

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:14.714
It turns out that we can use these sampling distributions

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:18.381
to understand the most likely values for a parameter as well.

00:00:18.381 --> 00:00:19.730
In the real world,

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.880
we don't usually know the value of a parameter as our populations of

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:28.469
interest tend to be things like everyone in the world or all the past,

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:31.324
present, and future transactions of a company.

00:00:31.324 --> 00:00:37.045
We just don't have all the information we might like to about these populations.

00:00:37.045 --> 00:00:38.804
So now, the question is,

00:00:38.804 --> 00:00:42.960
how do we use what we do know about sampling distributions to infer

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.185
something about these parameters for these large populations?

00:00:47.185 --> 00:00:50.179
And here is where the interesting part starts.

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:55.064
Imagine this distribution here is the sampling distribution for some statistic,

00:00:55.064 --> 00:00:56.909
any statistic of interest.

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:59.939
We can actually use this sampling distribution

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:03.460
to build a confidence interval for our parameter of interest.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.015
If we want a 95 percent confidence interval,

00:01:06.015 --> 00:01:08.159
we could cut off two and a half percent from

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.174
here and another two and a half percent from up here.

00:01:11.174 --> 00:01:16.079
These values would then give the range where we believe the parameter would be,

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:19.378
with 95 percent confidence.

00:01:19.378 --> 00:01:23.704
If alternatively, we wanted a 99 percent confidence interval,

00:01:23.704 --> 00:01:27.454
we would cut off a half a percent from each side,

00:01:27.454 --> 00:01:30.769
and these values would then give the range where we

00:01:30.769 --> 00:01:35.000
believe the parameter to be with 99 percent confidence.
