00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
Now that you've seen how you can use

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.240
sampling distributions to build confidence intervals for a single parameter,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.980
let's take a look at how we might do something

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.925
similar to estimate the difference in two parameters.

00:00:10.925 --> 00:00:13.125
Here, we might have a question.

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:15.779
What is the difference in average heights for

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:19.050
those who drink coffee versus those who do not?

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.719
Do we have evidence of a difference in the average height?

00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:23.820
In order to build a confidence interval for

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.574
the difference in the average heights for these two groups,

00:00:26.574 --> 00:00:28.960
we can do something similar to what you've already done.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.640
But for each iteration of taking the mean for each group,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.995
we're also going to take the difference.

00:00:36.994 --> 00:00:40.909
Now, we can iterate this process some large number of times and

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:42.769
use the resulting differences to

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.540
build the confidence interval for the difference in the means.

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.575
Here, I've set up a difference list and we'll append the differences into it.

00:00:50.575 --> 00:00:53.810
We could again plot the difference in the means of the two groups and we

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.245
could cut off the bottom two and a half and top two and a half percent,

00:00:57.244 --> 00:01:00.109
to build the 95 percent confidence interval for where

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.664
we believed the difference in the means of the two groups to exist.

00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:07.760
In this case, you saw that our confidence interval doesn't contain zero.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.410
And therefore, this would suggest that there is a difference in the population means.

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.914
Further, we would suggest that on average,

00:01:14.915 --> 00:01:18.310
coffee drinkers are actually taller than non-coffee drinkers.
