00:00:02.589 --> 00:00:07.655
You're now been introduced to a few different applications for confidence intervals,

00:00:07.655 --> 00:00:11.855
as well as a bootstrapping approach to creating these confidence intervals.

00:00:11.855 --> 00:00:16.024
We found that creating a confidence interval for the differences in means of two groups,

00:00:16.024 --> 00:00:18.934
rather than just comparing two point value estimates,

00:00:18.934 --> 00:00:22.129
is important to assure that the differences are not just

00:00:22.129 --> 00:00:26.184
occurring due to the randomness associated with the sample that was chosen.

00:00:26.184 --> 00:00:29.535
Confidence intervals are certainly useful.

00:00:29.535 --> 00:00:31.410
But there are issues that can arise when

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.390
exclusively using confidence intervals to make decisions.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.009
This brings up the ideas of Practical and Statistical Significance.

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:45.729
Let's consider an example to illustrate the difference between these two terms.

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:50.049
Imagine that I own a dog walking business and I'm advertising online.

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:52.409
I would like to know which of these two ads would

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:55.629
help me generate the most interest in my business.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.200
I send out each ad to the same number of

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.650
randomly selected users and I build the confidence interval,

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.664
that suggests that more people click this ad.

00:01:04.665 --> 00:01:06.789
Based on my confidence interval,

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:11.700
I have statistical evidence to suggest that the second ad is better.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.700
This evidence we get from the confidence interval is just this, Statistical Significance.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.814
Let's say that both ads generate

00:01:19.814 --> 00:01:23.804
enough interest to achieve more dogs than I can even handle watching.

00:01:23.805 --> 00:01:29.470
And that the second ad is much more expensive and time-consuming to create.

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:32.039
If a friend of yours decides that they would like to build

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.910
a similar ad campaign to start their own dog walking business,

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.549
which type of ad would you recommend to them?

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.920
In this case, you might suggest something like the first ad,

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.695
even though you statistically prove that the second ad was better.

00:01:45.694 --> 00:01:48.929
The first ad will generate enough interest in

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.705
their business and be less expensive and time intensive.

00:01:52.704 --> 00:01:58.950
Your suggestion for them to use the first ad is an example of Practical Significance.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.990
Practical significance takes into

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:04.004
consideration additional aspects and the world around us,

00:02:04.004 --> 00:02:05.819
rather than just the numbers.

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:08.310
And it's critically important to making your decisions.
