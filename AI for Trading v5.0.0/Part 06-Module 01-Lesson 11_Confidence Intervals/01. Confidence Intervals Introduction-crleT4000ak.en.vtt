00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.044
In this lesson, you'll be learning about confidence intervals.

00:00:06.044 --> 00:00:10.589
When we try to estimate a population parameter based on a sample statistic,

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:12.615
this is like fishing with a fishing pole.

00:00:12.615 --> 00:00:14.884
And there's nothing wrong with fishing this way.

00:00:14.884 --> 00:00:16.789
It's a perfectly good way to fish.

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.644
However, you'd be much more likely to catch a fish if you cast an entire net.

00:00:22.644 --> 00:00:25.489
How much more likely are you that you'll catch a fish?

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:28.219
Well, that depends on the size of the net.

00:00:28.219 --> 00:00:33.469
The larger the net, the more confident you can be that you'll actually capture a fish.

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.935
This net is much more likely to catch a fish than the smaller net.

00:00:37.935 --> 00:00:41.655
Though this example isn't exactly the same as building a confidence interval,

00:00:41.655 --> 00:00:43.500
because we consider a parameter to be

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.155
a non-moving number and not a moving fish amongst water.

00:00:47.155 --> 00:00:52.170
This idea that providing an interval and not just a single estimate will help us

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.060
gain confidence in our ability to capture

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.750
a population parameter is at the core of confidence intervals.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.460
And the wider our interval,

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.450
the more confident we can be that we capture our parameter of interest.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.010
Let's take a closer look.
