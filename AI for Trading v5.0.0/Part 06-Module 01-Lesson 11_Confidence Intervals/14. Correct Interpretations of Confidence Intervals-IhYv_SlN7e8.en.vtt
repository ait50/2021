00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.349
You've already learned a ton about how to build,

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:09.500
interpret, and use confidence intervals in practice.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.099
This video is just a reminder on the types of conclusions we

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.254
can make with confidence intervals and the types of conclusions we cannot make,

00:00:17.254 --> 00:00:19.085
which are commonly confused.

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:21.080
When we build confidence intervals,

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:22.474
they're aimed at parameters.

00:00:22.475 --> 00:00:26.995
That is, they're aimed at a single numeric value in our population.

00:00:26.995 --> 00:00:29.570
These values include the population mean,

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.484
or the population standard deviation,

00:00:31.484 --> 00:00:34.370
potentially the difference in two population means,

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:37.849
or any other numeric summary in the population.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.060
Notice that confidence intervals do not allow us to say something

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.380
specific about any individual in our population.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.679
More advanced techniques in Machine Learning do aim at

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:52.369
giving us information about every individual in a population,

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:57.070
but commonly, confidence intervals are not aimed at solving these types of problems.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.869
Confidence intervals are commonly aimed at

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:03.000
telling you about aggregate values in a population.
