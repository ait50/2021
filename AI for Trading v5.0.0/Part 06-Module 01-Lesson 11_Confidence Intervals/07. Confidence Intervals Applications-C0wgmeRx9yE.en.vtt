00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:04.269
In the previous concepts,

00:00:04.269 --> 00:00:07.750
you saw how we could build confidence intervals for different parameters,

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.259
like the mean or difference in means.

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:12.519
So what are some of the scenarios for which we would

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:15.205
want to build a confidence interval for the difference in means?

00:00:15.205 --> 00:00:17.890
Well, we could look at the effectiveness of

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.615
different drugs by comparing two groups who take two different drugs,

00:00:22.614 --> 00:00:27.454
or comparing a group that takes a drug to a group that did not take a drug at all.

00:00:27.454 --> 00:00:32.259
This type of testing is common for any of the health conditions around the world.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.829
Another use case specific to learning could be to implement

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:41.649
two different ways of teaching the same topic and see which way improves retention.

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:44.460
One of the most common use cases for comparing

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.655
two groups in this way is known as A/B testing,

00:00:47.655 --> 00:00:50.579
where we compared different webpages to one another to

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.559
determine which web designs drive the largest amount of traffic.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.240
The last topic will be covered in more detail in a later lesson,

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.679
as it's the key to survival for many online companies.
