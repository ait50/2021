Hi again, look through your
recent commit messages and

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.890
think about the formatting.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.010
How can you make the messages
more clear and helpful?

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.960
Think about how you would format
them using the guide in the previous

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:11.610
reading section.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.210
Just mark this check box when
you're ready to move on.
