00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.714
Hello and welcome back.

00:00:02.714 --> 00:00:06.089
Before we start working with Beautiful Soup,

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.494
let's take a quick look at how HTML works.

00:00:09.494 --> 00:00:15.660
Now, you don't have to be an HTML expert in order to use Beautiful Soup,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.355
but it's definitely important to know the basic workings of HTML.

00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:24.795
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language,

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:29.505
and it is the standard markup language for creating web pages.

00:00:29.504 --> 00:00:34.200
Basically, what HTML does is to describe

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.404
the structure of web pages using elements that are represented by tags,

00:00:39.404 --> 00:00:43.620
such as Head, Title, and so on.

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:50.250
All the information displayed on a web page is contained within this tags.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.344
What web browsers, such as Chrome or Firefox,

00:00:55.344 --> 00:01:00.350
actually do is to take the information contained within

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.760
the HTML file and render it to produce a web page like we see here.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:13.640
As we can see, the web browser doesn't actually display the HTML tags,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.314
but rather uses them to determine how to display the information contained within them.

00:01:20.314 --> 00:01:23.584
So let's see how this works in more detail.

00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:27.500
So here, we have a very simple web page.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.375
As we can see,

00:01:29.375 --> 00:01:31.864
it contains some headers,

00:01:31.864 --> 00:01:34.778
it also has some plain text,

00:01:34.778 --> 00:01:37.804
it also has an external link.

00:01:37.805 --> 00:01:41.495
We can also see that it has a blue background,

00:01:41.495 --> 00:01:45.305
and that this headers have an orange background.

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:51.910
So let's take a detailed look at the HTML file that created this web page.

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:59.269
Here we have the entire HTML document that produced this web page.

00:01:59.269 --> 00:02:06.569
The first thing we notice is that we have all these tags throughout our HTML file.

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:11.394
These HTML tags normally come in pairs,

00:02:11.395 --> 00:02:15.685
as we can see here with title and title.

00:02:15.685 --> 00:02:19.895
The first tag in the pair is called the opening tag,

00:02:19.895 --> 00:02:23.750
and the second one is called the closing tag.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.354
The closing tag is written just like the opening tag

00:02:28.354 --> 00:02:33.859
but with a forward slash before the tag name as we can see here.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:41.000
Now, let's quickly go through this HTML file to see what each tag does.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.474
At the beginning of the document,

00:02:43.474 --> 00:02:47.989
we see the doctype HTML declaration.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.235
This indicates that this document is using

00:02:52.235 --> 00:02:58.790
HTML5 which is the latest version of the HTML standard.

00:02:58.789 --> 00:03:06.859
This declaration must appear only once at the top of the page before any HTML tags.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.790
Now, the second tag is the HTML tag.

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:17.294
This tag is the root tag of the HTML file,

00:03:17.294 --> 00:03:23.169
and we can see that it has an attribute, lang equals en-US.

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:29.989
This lang attribute specifies that the language of this page is US English.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.870
We should note that all HTML tags can have attributes,

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:42.680
and that these attributes provide additional information about the HTML tags.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.118
The head tag contains information about the document

00:03:47.118 --> 00:03:52.490
such as a title tag that specifies the title of the page.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.745
In this case, it is AI for trading,

00:03:55.745 --> 00:03:59.450
and we can see it displayed right here.

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:03.819
The head tag also contains the meta tag.

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:09.358
This tag provides metadata about the HTML document,

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:10.814
and in this case,

00:04:10.814 --> 00:04:16.404
it is specifying that is using the UTF-8 characters set.

00:04:16.404 --> 00:04:19.969
Web browsers must know which character set to

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.740
use in order to display the HTML page correctly.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.000
Notice that this meta tag has no closing tag,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.959
because in HTML, the meta tag has no closing tag.

00:04:33.959 --> 00:04:40.069
We should also note that meta tags always go inside the head tag.

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:45.050
Our head tag also contains this link tag.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.629
In our case, this link tag links our page to

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:59.355
a CSS style sheet that is contained in a separate file named teststyle.css.

00:04:59.355 --> 00:05:02.480
It is this style sheet that determines

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.810
that the background of our web page should be blue.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:12.350
Similarly, this style tag determines the style of our h2 headings.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.240
For example, here we can see that it sets the background color of

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.480
our h2 headings to tomato which is displayed as this orange color right here.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:29.935
The body tag determines what will be displayed in the web page itself.

00:05:29.935 --> 00:05:35.899
Only the contents in the body tag will be displayed in a browser.

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:40.929
Let's take a look at the tags inside the body tag.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:48.843
The h1 tag defines a large heading and it is set to get help from peers and mentors,

00:05:48.843 --> 00:05:52.519
and we can see it displayed right here.

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:59.719
The div tag represents a division or a section in an HTML document.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:06.125
The h2 tag represents a slightly smaller heading than the h1 heading,

00:06:06.125 --> 00:06:08.459
and we can see them right here,

00:06:08.459 --> 00:06:11.739
student hub and knowledge.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.670
The P tag represents a paragraph,

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.770
and we can see one of them right here.

00:06:18.769 --> 00:06:23.414
The HR tag displays a horizontal line,

00:06:23.415 --> 00:06:27.390
and in HTML it has no end tag.

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:37.034
Finally, the A tag defines a hyperlink and it is used to link one web page with another.

00:06:37.035 --> 00:06:44.705
The HREF attribute of the A tag indicates the links destination.

00:06:44.704 --> 00:06:46.474
So in this case,

00:06:46.475 --> 00:06:52.890
this hyperlink will show up in the web page as knowledge as we can see here,

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:54.944
and if we click on this link,

00:06:54.944 --> 00:07:00.584
it will take us to knowledge.udacity.com.

00:07:00.584 --> 00:07:03.204
Throughout the following lessons,

00:07:03.204 --> 00:07:07.399
we will use this very simple HTML file to

00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:12.149
learn how to use Beautiful Soup to scrape data from websites.
