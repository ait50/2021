00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
Hello and welcome. In this lesson,

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.789
we will learn how to navigate the SEC website and how

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:14.289
to search the EDGAR database for the desired 10-K documents.

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:22.494
We begin by going to the US Securities and Exchange Commission website, sec.gov.

00:00:22.495 --> 00:00:25.875
Now, to access the EDGAR database,

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:31.679
we can go to the Filings menu and select the EDGAR Search Tools.

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.359
So if I click here,

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:36.704
this will take me to this webpage where we can see

00:00:36.704 --> 00:00:41.399
some general information about the Edgar Search Tools.

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.679
Now, if we want to find the filings for a specific company,

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:48.604
we can click here on Company Filings.

00:00:48.604 --> 00:00:50.509
So, let's click on that.

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:53.524
So, this will take us to this webpage.

00:00:53.524 --> 00:00:56.219
Now, the easiest way to look up

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.549
a company's filings is by using their ticker symbol or Central Index Key,

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:04.144
also known as the CIK.

00:01:04.144 --> 00:01:13.015
For example, let's look up Apple's filings by using its ticker symbol AAPL.

00:01:13.015 --> 00:01:14.859
So if we click Search,

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:18.474
we can see now all the filings filed by Apple.

00:01:18.474 --> 00:01:20.494
Now let's go back,

00:01:20.495 --> 00:01:24.079
and let's suppose I didn't know the ticker symbol or

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:28.010
Central Index Key of the company that I'm looking for.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.375
So, alternatively, we can also look up the company's name.

00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:36.980
For example, let's suppose I didn't know the ticker symbol for Apple,

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.079
so I can just put in here Apple and click on Search.

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:48.219
Notice that when we search by company name instead of ticker symbol or CIK,

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:50.375
we get a lot of results.

00:01:50.375 --> 00:01:55.730
This is because there are a lot of company names that have the word Apple in them,

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:01.370
such as Apple Box Productions or Apple Capital Group.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.430
Notice however, that even though there are

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.430
a lot of company names with the word Apple in them,

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.165
each company has a unique CIK number.

00:02:11.164 --> 00:02:15.199
The company we are interested in is Apple Incorporated,

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:20.959
which deals with electronic computers and was formerly known as Apple Computer.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.080
This number right here represents

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:30.745
the Standard Industrial Classification code and indicates a company's type of business.

00:02:30.745 --> 00:02:32.990
So, let's go ahead and select

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.450
Apple Incorporated by clicking on its corresponding CIK number.

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:40.864
Now in this page,

00:02:40.865 --> 00:02:45.280
we can see a list of all the documents filed by Apple through the years.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.955
In our case, however,

00:02:46.955 --> 00:02:49.795
we're only going to be looking at 10-Ks.

00:02:49.794 --> 00:02:53.304
So, we can select only the 10-Ks by typing

00:02:53.305 --> 00:02:58.490
10-K in the Filing Type box and clicking on Search.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:04.870
So now, we can see a list of all the 10-Ks filed by Apple starting from the

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:11.525
latest one in 2018 and going all the way back to 1994.

00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:15.919
Notice that we also get 10-K/A filings

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:20.215
which correspond to amendments made to some of the 10-Ks.

00:03:20.215 --> 00:03:24.085
Now, we can take a look at the 10-K filed

00:03:24.085 --> 00:03:27.915
in any particular year by clicking on Documents.

00:03:27.914 --> 00:03:34.534
So, let's click here to take a look at the most recent 10-K. Now in this page,

00:03:34.534 --> 00:03:37.504
we can see that there are multiple documents.

00:03:37.504 --> 00:03:43.639
For example, we can see that the first document corresponds to the actual 10-K.

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:47.839
These documents correspond to exhibits of the 10-K.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.289
The next two files are images and

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:55.713
this last file is a complete version of the 10-K document,

00:03:55.713 --> 00:03:58.669
but in a plain text format.

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:02.839
Now let's take a look at the 10-K document.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.075
Notice that this 10-K is in HTML format.

00:04:07.074 --> 00:04:10.324
So, let's click here to see what it looks like.

00:04:10.324 --> 00:04:13.819
So, here we have the 10-K document.

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:15.724
If we scroll down,

00:04:15.724 --> 00:04:23.730
we can see the table of contents and all the sections in this 10-K. For our purposes,

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.205
however, we will only be looking at item 1A,

00:04:28.204 --> 00:04:31.550
item 7, and item 7A.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.199
So, let's start by looking at item 1A.

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:37.045
As we can see,

00:04:37.045 --> 00:04:40.310
item 1A talks about risk factors.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.639
Each risk factor is highlighted in bold.

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:49.550
For example, the first risk factor that is being discussed is

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.504
about global and regional economic conditions

00:04:52.504 --> 00:04:55.654
could materially adversely affect the company's business,

00:04:55.654 --> 00:05:00.274
results of operations, financial condition, and growth.

00:05:00.274 --> 00:05:04.264
Here we see another risk factor being discussed,

00:05:04.264 --> 00:05:08.899
which talks about global markets for the company's products and services are

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:13.649
highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change,

00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:18.304
and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.

00:05:18.305 --> 00:05:20.060
If we scroll down,

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.040
we can see all the other risk factors discussed in this particular 10-K.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.840
Now, let's quickly take a look at item 7 and 7A.

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:35.000
Here we have item 7 whose subject is

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.850
the management's discussion and analysis

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.750
of financial condition and results of operations.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:46.259
As we can see, this session has a lot of financial data,

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:51.034
such as sales data, product performance,

00:05:51.035 --> 00:05:53.090
net sales of each product,

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:57.359
operating expenses, revenue, et cetera.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.300
Now let's take a quick look at item 7A.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.105
Here we have item 7A,

00:06:05.105 --> 00:06:10.400
which talks about quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:14.644
In particular, they focus on the risk due to

00:06:14.644 --> 00:06:19.639
interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:26.839
Now let's go back to this page and let's take a quick look at the complete 10-K document,

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:30.199
but now in plain text format.

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:34.629
Here we have the same 10-K document we saw before,

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:38.625
but now it is just in plain text format.

00:06:38.625 --> 00:06:41.259
Even though it looks very messy,

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:46.579
this is actually the document we will be using to inscribe data from the 10-Ks.

00:06:46.579 --> 00:06:53.245
This is because all the 10-Ks can't be found in HTML format.

00:06:53.245 --> 00:06:59.670
For example, let's take a look at the 10-K filing from 1994.

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:06.470
We can see that the 10-K document is only available in plain text format.

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:08.120
So if we click here,

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:13.120
we can see the 10-K that was filed in 1994.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:20.259
So now you know how to use the EDGAR database to find the 10-Ks for any company you want.
