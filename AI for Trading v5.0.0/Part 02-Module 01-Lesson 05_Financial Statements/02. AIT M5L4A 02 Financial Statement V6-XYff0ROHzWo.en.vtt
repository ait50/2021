00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.459
For long-term investments, there is

00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:06.585
a lot more information about a company besides basic trading data.

00:00:06.585 --> 00:00:09.089
Things like market share,

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:12.029
products and services, and growth potential

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:15.434
can be important factors for long-term trends.

00:00:15.435 --> 00:00:18.344
Where could we get this information potentially?

00:00:18.344 --> 00:00:20.594
In financial reports.

00:00:20.594 --> 00:00:22.099
In the United States,

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.750
we have the Security and Exchange Commission,

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:32.325
the SEC, created to protect investors and facilitate disclosure of corporate information.

00:00:32.325 --> 00:00:36.200
By law, large publicly traded companies are

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.689
required to file periodic financial reports with the SEC,

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:43.399
and these reports must be truthful and

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.634
accurate so they could be very useful for making investment decisions.

00:00:48.634 --> 00:00:52.729
The most common reports are called 10-Ks which are

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:57.464
filed annually and 10-Qs which are filed quarterly.

00:00:57.465 --> 00:01:02.040
To be concrete, we're going to focus on the 10-Ks.

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:09.109
10-Ks are long and detailed documents separated into four main parts.

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:12.935
Part one is the business overview and it contains

00:01:12.935 --> 00:01:17.600
important information about risks and possible legal proceedings.

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:20.944
Part two, business and finance.

00:01:20.944 --> 00:01:23.858
It includes discussion or market conditions,

00:01:23.858 --> 00:01:27.664
projections, and highlights of the financial report.

00:01:27.665 --> 00:01:29.900
Part three is governance.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.415
It includes information on executive board members and compensations.

00:01:34.415 --> 00:01:36.590
Finally, part four is

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.710
the full financial report which contains detailed information on spendings on earnings.

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:47.375
Allegedly, legendary investor Warren Buffett raised, on average,

00:01:47.375 --> 00:01:50.530
500 pages of these reports every day,

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.070
and financial reports have probably helped him make investment decisions.

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:59.854
Maybe we don't have the time to read like Warren Buffett, but still,

00:01:59.855 --> 00:02:02.570
with the aid of natural language processing,

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:06.794
we can easily extract information that could be useful for trading.

00:02:06.795 --> 00:02:11.205
Luckily for us, in the US the SEC created

00:02:11.205 --> 00:02:16.770
EDGAR which stands for the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.400
It's essentially a website that gives you

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.780
straightforward access to all the available financial statements.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.534
In the following lessons,

00:02:25.534 --> 00:02:29.419
we will focus on particular sections of the 10-K reports.

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:32.479
This includes: Part one,

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:36.384
item one A that discusses business risk factors.

00:02:36.384 --> 00:02:41.704
Part two, item seven and seven A that discuss market risks.

00:02:41.705 --> 00:02:46.868
These sections I'll learn important risk factors like lawsuits, taxes,

00:02:46.868 --> 00:02:49.400
and potential changes in market supply or

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.550
demand that could be useful for generating trading signals.
