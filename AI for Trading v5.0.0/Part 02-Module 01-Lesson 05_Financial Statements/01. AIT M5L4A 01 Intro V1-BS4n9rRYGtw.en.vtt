Hi everyone. I'm Juan,

00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:04.964
a new instructor for the AI for Trading course.

00:00:04.964 --> 00:00:07.710
Before joining Udacity, I was doing research in

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.324
cosmology and have utilized many AI algorithms to

00:00:11.324 --> 00:00:13.889
analyze huge data sets to extract

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.240
tiny signals hidden in astronomical data with lots of noise.

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:22.799
Similar techniques are using financial data to extract trading signals.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.734
I've also helped design that Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree here at Udacity.

00:00:27.734 --> 00:00:32.460
By now, you should be more acquainted with how natural language processing works.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.615
So, let's apply that knowledge in our finance specific context.

00:00:36.615 --> 00:00:38.125
In the following lessons,

00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:41.119
we will study financial documents closely and

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:44.689
learn to extract features that may be useful for trading.

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:47.765
We're really excited to bring you engaging content

00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:51.140
and help you succeed in this course. So, let's get started.
