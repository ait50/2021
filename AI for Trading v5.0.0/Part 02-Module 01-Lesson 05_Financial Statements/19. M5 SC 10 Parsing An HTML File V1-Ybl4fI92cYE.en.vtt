Hello and welcome back.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.410
In this notebook, we will see how to parse an HTML file.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.320
In order to parse an HTML file,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.580
we need to parse the file into the BeautifulSoup constructor.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.320
We can parse our file to the BeautifulSoup constructor either

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.045
as a string or as an open file handle as we have done here.

00:00:24.045 --> 00:00:29.460
The BeautifulSoup constructor will return a BeautifulSoup object.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.120
These BeautifulSoup object represents the document as

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:37.244
a whole and can be searched using various methods.

00:00:37.244 --> 00:00:41.189
We will see how to do this in the following lessons.

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:47.089
For now, let's print the BeautifulSoup object to see what it looks like.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.170
As we can see, the BeautifulSoup object holds

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.340
the entire contents of our sample HTML file.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.400
However, it is not printed in a nice format and it is very hard to read.

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.920
Luckily, the BeautifulSoup object has the "prettify" method that

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.379
allows the BeautifulSoup object to be printed with all the tags nicely indented.

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:18.219
In the next lesson,

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:23.189
we will see how to access the information contained in each tag.
