00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.265
Now, let's try to use

00:00:02.265 --> 00:00:07.050
a regular expression to find this period at the end of our sentence.

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.059
So, let's use a period as

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.620
a regular expression and let's run this code just as we did before.

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.085
We can see that something has gone wrong.

00:00:17.085 --> 00:00:21.510
The finditer method has matched every single character in

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.905
our sample text including uppercase and lowercase letters,

00:00:25.905 --> 00:00:30.585
word space and the period at the end of our sentence.

00:00:30.585 --> 00:00:34.350
The reason it did that is because in regular expressions,

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.640
the period is a special character known as a metacharacter.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.359
Metacharacters are used to give special instructions,

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:45.399
and cannot be searched for directly.

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.975
Here's a complete list of the Metacharacters used in regular expressions,

00:00:49.975 --> 00:00:53.289
and we will learn how to use them in later lessons.

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.070
If we want to search for this metacharacters in strings,

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.320
we need to escape them first.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.945
Just like with Python string literals,

00:01:01.945 --> 00:01:06.109
we can use the backslash to escape all the metacharacters.

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:10.525
So, now let's try to find the period of the end of our sentence again,

00:01:10.525 --> 00:01:13.210
but this time we will use a backslash in

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:17.409
our regular expression to remove the period special meaning.

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.030
If we run this code,

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.549
we will see that now the finditer method,

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.009
only gets one match which corresponds to

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.020
the period at the end of the sentence as we wanted.
