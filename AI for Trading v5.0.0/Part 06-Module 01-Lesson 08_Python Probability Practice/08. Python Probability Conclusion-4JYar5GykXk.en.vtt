00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.365
In this lesson, you put your new probability skills to practice using Python.

00:00:05.365 --> 00:00:10.265
In order to gain an understanding of some of the complex topics in the next sections,

00:00:10.265 --> 00:00:12.485
we'll be working with Python more and more.

00:00:12.484 --> 00:00:15.730
It's often easier to understand these complex ideas through

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.675
simulations and Python than it is to prove them mathematically.

00:00:19.675 --> 00:00:22.375
You will see a bit of both in the upcoming lessons.

00:00:22.375 --> 00:00:25.230
So your practice here will definitely come in handy.
