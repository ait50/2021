00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.654
Now that you've seen some examples and the math involved with them,

00:00:03.654 --> 00:00:07.025
you're going to apply this knowledge to problems using Python.

00:00:07.025 --> 00:00:11.380
This lesson includes screencast and Jupyter notebooks to help you

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.480
practice using Python to explore the topics of

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.390
probability you just learned. Let's get started.
