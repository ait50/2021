00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
Welcome back. So, in this notebook,

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.724
you'll be building your own neural network to classify clothing images.

00:00:08.724 --> 00:00:10.919
So, like I talked about in the last video,

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:14.099
MNIST is actually a fairly trivial dataset these days.

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.914
It's really easy to get really high accuracy with a neural network.

00:00:18.914 --> 00:00:21.625
So instead, you're going to be using Fashion-MNIST,

00:00:21.625 --> 00:00:24.179
and this is basically just a drop-in replacement for MNIST

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:26.820
so we have 28 by 28 grayscale images,

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.199
but this time it's clothing.

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.903
So, you have a lot more variation in the classes,

00:00:31.903 --> 00:00:33.494
and it just ends up being

00:00:33.494 --> 00:00:37.019
a much more difficult problem to classify like there's a t-shirt,

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.280
there's pants, there's a sweater,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.219
there's shoes instead of handwritten digits.

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.644
So it's a better representation of datasets that you'd use in the real world.

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:50.330
So, I've left this up to you to actually build a network and train it.

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.039
So here you can define your network architecture,

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.359
then here you will create your network to

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:59.884
define the criterion and optimizer and then write the code for the training pass.

00:00:59.884 --> 00:01:03.729
Once you have your network built and trained,

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:05.310
you can test out your network.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.030
So here, you'd want to do a forward pass, get your logits,

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.530
calculate the class probabilities, maybe output of your network,

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.049
and then pass in one of these images from

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.519
the test set and check out if your network can actually predict it correctly.

00:01:19.519 --> 00:01:22.189
If you want to see my solution, it's in the next notebook, part five,

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.200
and you'll also see it in the next video. Cheers.
