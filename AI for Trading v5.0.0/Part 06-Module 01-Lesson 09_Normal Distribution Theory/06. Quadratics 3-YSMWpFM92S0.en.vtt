00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
It follows it's got to be something like a quarter.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We already learned that 4 widens the quadratic, so that can't be it.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
One is already shown over here.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Zero makes no sense because we have division by 0

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
which you can think of as a quadratic that shoots up almost like a straight line,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
but honestly it doesn't make any sense.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
A quarter is the one that really describes this particular quadratic the best.

00:00:22.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Now, that's great. Now we understand this expression over here.
