00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is it makes it wider.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
To see why is this affects the vertical dimension--the output

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and scales it down by a factor of 4.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So that we said before gets dragged down by a factor of 4.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
That means this point over here finds itself here.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This one over here finds itself here.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
That means we'll widen out the quadratic.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Observe that large variances yield wide quadratics.

00:00:26.000 --> 99:59:59.999
Small or tight variances yield sharp quadratics.
