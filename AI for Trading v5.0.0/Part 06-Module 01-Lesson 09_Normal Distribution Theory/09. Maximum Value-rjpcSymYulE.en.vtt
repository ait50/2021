00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Quite interestingly, even though this formula looks complex, it a really easy answer,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
which is when x = µ this thing here is 0.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
That makes the entire thing 0.

00:00:09.000 --> 99:59:59.000
e⁰--any value to the 0--is going to be 1.
