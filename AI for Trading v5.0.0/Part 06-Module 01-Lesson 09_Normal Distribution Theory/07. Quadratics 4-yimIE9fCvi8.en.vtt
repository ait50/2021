00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's go further, and let's now take this function and multiply it by -Â½.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Again, I ask you what the affect it.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
If this is your original quadratic, then what do we get?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We already know that it's going to flatten it, because you are dividing the f value by half,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
but are we going to get something like this or perhaps something like this?

00:00:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Pick one of those two choices.
