00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
What you are about to see is one of the most transformative parts of modern statistics

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and it uses things if like we've never seen before.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We start out with the binomial distribution that you're familiar with from our last unit

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and then we move into the central limit theorem which basically means

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
we take a number of coin flips to infinity.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
From that, we arrive at the normal distribution which is basis to so much in statistics--

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
all of testing and confidence intervals are defined though the normal distribution.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And the reason why this matters is much of what we've done in coin flips had one or two coin flips

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
but in statistics experiments, you often have 1000 of patients or 1000 of data points

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and then starting the normal distribution as an approximation

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
to the binomial distribution is much more practical.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So let's start--so when we start with our now well established formula for binomial distributions

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
where N is the number of coin flips, k is how often it comes up with heads

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and p is the probability that the coin comes up with heads, usually 0.5.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And I want to graph for fix n this function here. K can go from 0 all the way to 20.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Instead of letting you compute this thing over here for all those different values of k,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I'm going to ask a different question--suppose you have a fair coin,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.000
what do you think this value takes on its maximum value, which value of k maximizes our expression.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I know you can't really know this but with some thought,

00:01:36.000 --> 99:59:59.999
I believe you'll arrive at the correct answer.
