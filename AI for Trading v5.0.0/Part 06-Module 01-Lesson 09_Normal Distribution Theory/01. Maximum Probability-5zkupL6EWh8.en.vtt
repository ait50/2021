00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I just programmed and ran the experiment,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and the answer is 10.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The reason why the answer is 10 is because the number of combinations to place 10 positives

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and 10 negatives into our list of 20 is larger than any other number.

00:00:16.000 --> 99:59:59.000
This term over here is maximized when k is exactly half of N--so 10.
