00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In particular, if we now look at the quadratic over here, which is much tighter,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
which of the following potential σ² would you think is best representative

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
of this narrow function over here, provided that this is the quadratic that corresponds

00:00:13.000 --> 99:59:59.999
to σ² = 1. Check one of those four--4, 1, ¼, and 0.
