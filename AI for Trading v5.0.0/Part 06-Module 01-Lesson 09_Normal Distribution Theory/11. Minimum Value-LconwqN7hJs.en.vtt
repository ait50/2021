00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is 0.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
As x goes to infinity, this expression goes to negative infinity.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The exponential of negative infinity converges to 0.

00:00:08.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So, now we've got basically the normal distribution function.
