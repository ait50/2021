00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.590
As I'm sure you've guessed this is the probability

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.010
for a single coin flip. This is the formula we

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.340
can use for multiple coin flips and as we

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.720
go to very large numbers, the [UNKNOWN] is often a

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.330
good approximation for the outcome of many coin flips.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.370
I should warn you, if the coin flip is zero

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.710
to one, then the mean is always in the

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.960
positive. This can assume negative values, but it's an approximation
