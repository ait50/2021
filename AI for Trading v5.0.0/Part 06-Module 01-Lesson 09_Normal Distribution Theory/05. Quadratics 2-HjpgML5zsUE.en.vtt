00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The next thing I'll do is I'll divide it by σ².

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Without telling you why I'm doing this, I want to see what the effect is.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Suppose σ² = 4. That means we have a variance of 4 and a standard deviation of 2.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I've given you already the quadratic function when it isn't divided by σ².

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It's the same as saying σ² = 1.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
What I'd like to know is whether our new version where σ² = 4

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
makes this quadratic wider or whether it makes it narrower,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
assuming that this is our new function f(x).

00:00:31.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So, pick one of the two, or perhaps it stays the same. Then pick the third.
