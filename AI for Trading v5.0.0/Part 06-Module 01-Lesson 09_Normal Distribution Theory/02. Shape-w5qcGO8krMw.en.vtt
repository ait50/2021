00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And it's this one. Let me show you.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Here's a typical one, and I apologize the axis over here can't really be read,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
but you can take with faith that the center is 0.5,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and you can see the characteristic bell curve for this simple coin-flipping experiment.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
For this run the mean was 0.50006.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
If I run it again, I get a different sample.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And there is some randomness involved as this bar over here illustrates,

00:00:24.000 --> 99:59:59.000
but over the randomness you can clearly see the bell-shaped curve that flattens off on the sides.
