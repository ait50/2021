00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.800
So let's look for a second at different ways

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.900
to compute probabilities for coin flips. You have a

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.890
coin that has probability P of coming up heads.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.240
I will give you now 3 very different formulas.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.503
Here's a single probability, here's our common [UNKNOWN] formula

00:00:17.503 --> 00:00:21.150
and here's our Gaussian exponential. So what I want

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.530
to know from you is which one of these

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.560
formulas is best suited to compute a probability for

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.740
a single coin flip, a few coin flips, or many coin flips,

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.480
possibly even infinity coin flips as a limit value? So click exactly

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.650
three of those buttons, one each row and one each column for

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.430
the best correspondence of the formula to the case on the left
