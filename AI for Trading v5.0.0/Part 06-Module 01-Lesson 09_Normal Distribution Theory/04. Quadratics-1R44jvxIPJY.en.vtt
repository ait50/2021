00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I will define for you a normal distribution with a specific mean

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
that's often called µ, Greek letter µ,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and a variance that's often called σ².

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We already know that variance is a quadratic expression.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
In normal land we often use µ and σ². Let's do this.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The very first element is that for any outcome x we write the quadratic difference

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
between this outcome x and µ.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This is indeed a function in x. So, look at this.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Here are four possible hypotheses of what this function might look like.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Each case is µ is on the right side some where.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The horizontal axis is x, and we're graphing f(x).

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The first I'll give you is a triangular function.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The second is a quadratic function.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The third one is a negative quadratic function.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And the fourth one is a quadratic function that doesn't quite touch µ.

00:00:49.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So, which one in your opinion best describes this formula over here?
