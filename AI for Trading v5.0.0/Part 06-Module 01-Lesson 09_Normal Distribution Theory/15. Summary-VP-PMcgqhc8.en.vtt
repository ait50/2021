00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
What I've shown you in the beginning of class have from a coin flip to a binomial distribution

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
all the way to a normal distribution, and you might think that this was challenging and indeed it was.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
As it turns out, you can treat all this things about the same.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
In fact, if you're a medical doctor and you have one patient, you might think of it as a coin flip.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
If you have 10 patients, you might think of it as binomial distribution.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
If you do what's normally done, when your test say a new drug and you have, say 10,000 patients

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
then this thing over here is a beautiful and very compact representation of it.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Otherwise, it would be almost impossible to compute.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
That's the purpose of normal distribution for the sake of this class.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
As you go forward and look into hypotheses testing and confidence then develops.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
You don't do this for this relatively complicated expressions over here.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We just do it for the normal distribution that I think relatively easy to compute.

00:00:56.000 --> 99:59:59.999
Welcome to the world of normal distributions.
