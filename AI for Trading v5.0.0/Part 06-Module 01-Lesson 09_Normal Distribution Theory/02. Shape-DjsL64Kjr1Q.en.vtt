00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The other interesting thing is things fall down in the interesting fashion

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
as you deviate from 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 all the way to 0 or 20.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Obviously we got a curve that looks a bit like this.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This curves is often called a bell curve because it's quite feasible to think of it as a church bell--

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that's move left and right and rings the bells.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I did a related experiment--actually I bought a piece of software to flip a coin 1000 times

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and if you did the last optional units on programming, you wrote a piece of software

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
to flip a coin a 1000 times and from that, I looked at the empirical frequency

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
which is the same as that count of heads divided by a 1000, but this one scales between 0 and 1.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I called this thing an experiment--I flip the coin a 1000 times, out comes a one singular number

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
which is the ratio of heads to the total number of experiments.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
It should be 0.5 in the ideal case but often it's a little bit off 0.5.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I repeated this experiment 1000 times and that means

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I've got 1000 samples of this ratio over here. When I do this, I got a whole bunch of means.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
When I run a histogram over those, I might see a curve.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
What shape do you think the curve has--is it going to be like this, is it going to be like this,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
like this or like this, all are focused on 0.5.

00:01:19.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Which one do you think is it?
