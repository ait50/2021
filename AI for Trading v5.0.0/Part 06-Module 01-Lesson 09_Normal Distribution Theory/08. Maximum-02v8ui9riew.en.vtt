00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
to understand the solution, it's useful to draw the exponential function.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
e⁰ is 1 and then it goes up exponentially to really large numbers.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
If you've ever heard Ray Kurzweil  talk about the future of society,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
you've seen these curves--everything goes up exponentially.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Everything is just exponential.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And further, if you go back in time to negative values,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
this thing slowly drifts down to 0.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Of course, that's not very exciting, so we never talk about exponential in the negative space.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
However, it turns out that all the arguments of the exponential are at best 0

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and otherwise are negative, because the exponential is monotonic--

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
that is the larger its argument, the larger its exponential value.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It ought to be optimized where this thing over here is the largest,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and where is that the case?

00:00:46.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Well, it's exactly where µ hits 0.
