Let me ask you another question.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
What is the value of this function if we go to the point where it's maximum,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
which is x = µ? That's the way to write this.

00:00:09.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Compute for me in your head this what this thing will be when x = µ.
