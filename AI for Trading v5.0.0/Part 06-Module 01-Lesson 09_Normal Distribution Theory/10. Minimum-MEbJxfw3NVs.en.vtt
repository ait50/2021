00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is now ± ∞.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
If you look at this, if you put a really large positive or negative value in,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
the difference to any µ will be enormous.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The square will be even more enormous.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Therefore, this entire expression on the right side will be huge.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Put a minus sign in front of it, and you have a hugely negative number.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
You have e^-∞.

00:00:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
e^-∞ drive the e curve all the way to the left where this just ends up to be minimized.
