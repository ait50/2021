00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We have a function f that assumes the value 1 when x = µ

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that goes to 0 when x goes to ±∞.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It so happens that it looks like a bell curve.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The fact that it looks like a bell curve is not entirely obvious,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but you have to take my word for it.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This--what I would consider a relatively simple formula--

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
describes the limit of making infinitely many coin flips.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
In fact, it describes the limit of computing a mean over any set of experiments.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This is a very powerful result.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
No matter what you do when you drive n to very large numbers you get a bell curve like this.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
There is one flaw here, and I'll tell you about the flaw without going into detail.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
That is the area underneath this curve doesn't always add up to 1.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
In fact, without proof, it adds up to √2πσ².

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The reason why this matters is deeply buried in probability theory.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
But it turns out we want all these areas to add up to 1 just as much as we wanted

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
a coin flip and its complement to add up to 1.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The true normal distribution is normalized by just the inverse of this thing over here--1/√2πσ².

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So, that is the normal distribution of any value x indexed by the parameter µ and σ².

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So, this is a very deep piece of mathematics.

00:01:24.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Now, we will apply it a little bit for you to practice how the normal distribution looks in the field.
