00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So, here is our normal distribution again.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I'm going to write it as "exp" for exponential         {-½ (x - µ)²/σ²}.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The truth is when you're new to this this looks really cryptic.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
When you're with statistics for many years as I have been,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
you wake up in the middle of the night and you can recite this formula.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It's as normal as getting breakfast in the morning or having a beer after dinner.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
What I want to get into your brains is not the complexity of the formula.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I want you to really understand how this formula is constructed.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I you to understand the quadratic penalty term of deviations from the expectation

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
of the mean of this expression.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Then the exponential that squeezes it back into the curves.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
That's basically what it is.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We can draw values from this normal distribution just the same way as we flipped coins before.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The way to look at this is any value x has this probability up here.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
This is nothing else but a notation of the probability of x for a normal distribution with µ and σ².

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So, a value x that has twice the high bar than some other value x'

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
will have twice as much of a probability of being drawn.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Now, obviously, the normal has an entire continuous space of outcomes.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And obviously that renders each individual outcome of probability 0.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
But, in essence, you can think of the height of this thing over here

00:01:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
as being proportional to the probability that this value is being drawn.
