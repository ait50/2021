00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And quite interestingly, we inverted the sign,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
so all of a sudden the function is negative.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Quite obviously, green is the correct answer.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So, now we have a quadratic that points down into the negative space

00:00:11.000 --> 99:59:59.000
whose maximum value is 0 and otherwise, it's strictly negative. That's this function f over here.
