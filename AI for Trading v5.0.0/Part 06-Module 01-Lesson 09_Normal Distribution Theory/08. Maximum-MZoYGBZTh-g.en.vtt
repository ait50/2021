00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And now I'm going to take the most extreme of all steps.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm going to make this the exponent of the e function.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Remember, the inner argument is a quadratic that points down.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This a bit does depend on σ. This mean is µ so I call this f(x) where f(x) maximize.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And I'll give you several choices for x=µ, x=0, x=-infinity, or x=+infinity.

00:00:24.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Where will this thing be the largest?
