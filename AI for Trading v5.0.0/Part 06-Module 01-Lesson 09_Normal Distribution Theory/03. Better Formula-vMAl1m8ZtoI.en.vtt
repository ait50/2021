00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is a resounding yes.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Even more so, what I'm going to show you doesn't just apply

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
to binomial distributions with fair coins.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It applies to almost any distribution that is sampled many, many times,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
which is a  very deep statistical result.

00:00:16.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I will construct for you the formula that is being used.
