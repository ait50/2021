00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I would submit that it's this one over here.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The reason is this expression is 0 when x = Âµ.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
As a result, it can't be the fourth of these choices.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It's strictly non-negative, so it can't go down into the negative area,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
so this one is being out ruled. It's quadratic.

00:00:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Hence, a function like this doesn't make sense, so it must be this one over here.
