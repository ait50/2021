00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.165
Congratulations on completing this lesson on functions.

00:00:04.165 --> 00:00:07.724
You learned about functions, variable scope,

00:00:07.724 --> 00:00:13.439
documentation, lambda expressions, iterators, and generators.

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:15.989
Next, you'll learn how to write scripts in

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.765
local environments with many functions pieced together.

00:00:19.765 --> 00:00:21.355
That's a lot of stuff.

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:24.089
It's okay if you haven't mastered everything yet.

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:27.855
You've already accomplished a ton by getting this far.

00:00:27.855 --> 00:00:31.000
We'll practice more of these concepts in the next lesson.
