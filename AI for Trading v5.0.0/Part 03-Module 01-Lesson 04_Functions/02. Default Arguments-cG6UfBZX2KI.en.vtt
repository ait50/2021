00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.049
Let's revisit the cylinder volume function,

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.014
but with one modification.

00:00:06.014 --> 00:00:08.865
This function includes a default argument.

00:00:08.865 --> 00:00:11.144
If radius is not specified,

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:16.125
then the variable radius will default to five when used in the function body.

00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:21.574
Calling the function like this would be the same thing as calling it like this,

00:00:21.574 --> 00:00:26.559
because radius is set to five if not specified as another value.

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:32.890
Default arguments allow functions to use default values when those arguments are omitted.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.789
This is helpful because it can make your code more concise in

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:40.805
scenarios where there is a common value you can use for a variable,

00:00:40.805 --> 00:00:43.914
although you still want it to be customizable.

00:00:43.914 --> 00:00:49.825
In this example, the default radius is five but we can still change this.

00:00:49.825 --> 00:00:52.495
This time when we call the function,

00:00:52.494 --> 00:00:56.649
we are overriding the default value of five and calculating

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:01.574
the cylinder volume for a cylinder with a radius of seven instead.

00:01:01.575 --> 00:01:06.930
Also notice here, we're passing values to our arguments by position.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.305
It's possible to pass values in two ways,

00:01:10.305 --> 00:01:13.080
by position and by name.

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:17.234
Each of these function is evaluated in the same way.

00:01:17.234 --> 00:01:19.829
This one is simply taking the arguments by

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:24.435
position while this function is accepting arguments by name.

00:01:24.435 --> 00:01:27.240
There are some nuances for when you can perform

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:30.224
the passing of values in each of these ways.

00:01:30.224 --> 00:01:34.250
You'll see more applications of this in the following quiz section.
