00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.940
Welcome to this lesson on functions.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.574
Previously, we used several of Python's built-in functions.

00:00:07.575 --> 00:00:10.900
Here, we will write functions of our own.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.199
Functions are useful chunks of code that allow you to encapsulate a task.

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.239
Encapsulation is a way to carry out a whole series of steps with one simple command.

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:25.269
For example, imagine you want to bake a cake.

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:26.949
You would need to buy the ingredients,

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.004
mix them together in a certain way for specific amounts of time,

00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:33.894
put it all in the oven, and then let it cool.

00:00:33.895 --> 00:00:36.475
In computer programming, functions

00:00:36.475 --> 00:00:40.840
encapsulate all the steps of a process into one command.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.655
In this case, we might just have

00:00:42.655 --> 00:00:47.875
a bake cake function and throw all of these directions into this one function.

00:00:47.875 --> 00:00:50.409
Now any, time you want to bake a cake,

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.969
we just use this function without worrying about all the specifics.

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:00.039
Functions are also used to help organize and optimize code. Let's get started.
