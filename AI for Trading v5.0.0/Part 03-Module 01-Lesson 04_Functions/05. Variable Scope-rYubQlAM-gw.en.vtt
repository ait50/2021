00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:10.539
Scope refers to which parts of a program a variable can be referenced or used from.

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:13.959
If a variable is created inside a function,

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.390
it can only be used within that function.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.330
Consider these two functions,

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:22.389
word count and nearest square.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.300
The first function uses answer to count words in a document.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.674
The second function uses answer to check values while searching for the nearest square.

00:00:33.674 --> 00:00:36.714
Both functions include this answer variable,

00:00:36.715 --> 00:00:39.100
but they are distinct variables that can

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.115
only be referenced within their respective functions.

00:00:43.115 --> 00:00:48.445
Alternatively, we might have a variable defined outside of functions, like this.

00:00:48.445 --> 00:00:53.625
And we can access it anywhere outside or within these functions.

00:00:53.625 --> 00:00:58.975
Scope is essential to understanding how information is passed throughout programs,

00:00:58.975 --> 00:01:02.000
in Python, and really any programming language.
