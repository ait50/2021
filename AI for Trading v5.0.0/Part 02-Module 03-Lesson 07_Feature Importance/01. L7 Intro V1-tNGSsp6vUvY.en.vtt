00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
Let's talk about a topic of growing importance,

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.234
which is a machine learning interpretability.

00:00:05.235 --> 00:00:07.860
It's often the case that in business applications,

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.115
companies may choose to use a simple linear model

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:15.240
rather than a complex nonlinear model for the sake of interpretability.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.010
When you build a model,

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.320
you'll need to be able to understand how it's

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.914
using the features to generate its predictions.

00:00:21.914 --> 00:00:24.299
This is because you want to know when it might work

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.164
well and when it may need human intervention.

00:00:27.164 --> 00:00:31.320
You may also have to explain your model to the portfolio managers,

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.115
and even to the clients who are considering investing in your fund.

00:00:35.115 --> 00:00:37.844
If a complex model is like a black box,

00:00:37.844 --> 00:00:40.019
in that humans can't interpret it,

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.910
then the company may still prefer to stay with a simpler model like regression.

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:46.174
Which is more easily explainable.

00:00:46.174 --> 00:00:50.750
This is sometimes called the black box white-box trade-off.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.034
Researchers have been building models to help interpret machine learning models,

00:00:56.034 --> 00:01:01.144
and this is very relevant because by making complex models interpretable and explainable,

00:01:01.145 --> 00:01:05.060
this opens the door for complex models to be more readily

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.269
acceptable and used in business applications including in finance.
