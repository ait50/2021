00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.104
So to create this expression,

00:00:03.104 --> 00:00:07.859
let's divide up this adding of sequences to the coalition into two parts.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.195
So there's the sequence of features before adding feature i,

00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:17.940
and there's the sequence of features that are added after we add feature i.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.120
For the set of features that are added before we add feature i,

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.589
We're going to call this set S. S is what we saw in the formula above.

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:31.565
For the set of features that are added after we add feature i,

00:00:31.565 --> 00:00:33.515
we'll call this Q,

00:00:33.515 --> 00:00:35.825
and Q is not in the formula,

00:00:35.825 --> 00:00:40.105
but I'm using Q so that is easier to follow this example.

00:00:40.104 --> 00:00:43.699
So given the sixth sequences that we saw earlier,

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.719
and also given that we're looking at feature x sub two,

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.379
here's what sets S and Q are for each sequence.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.380
So notice we added feature zero and then one.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.590
So these all occur before adding feature two.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.465
After adding feature two,

00:00:59.465 --> 00:01:00.680
there are no other features.

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:02.359
So Q is an empty set.

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.579
Okay. So the second example is,

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:07.840
if we had feature zero and then next is feature two.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.299
So set S is just the set with feature zero,

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.295
and after we add feature two,

00:01:13.295 --> 00:01:15.150
we're going to add a feature one.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.695
So Q is the set that contains feature one.

00:01:18.694 --> 00:01:22.549
So you can pause here and look at all six of these examples.

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.444
So for the first and third sequences,

00:01:25.444 --> 00:01:30.004
these have the same set S contains features zero and one.

00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:32.599
They also have the same set Q,

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:34.500
where Q is the empty set.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.674
So another way to calculate that there are two of these sequences,

00:01:38.674 --> 00:01:42.094
that there's this one and that there's this one,

00:01:42.094 --> 00:01:47.034
is to take S factorial times Q factorial which is two.

00:01:47.034 --> 00:01:50.899
So similarly, for these two which are the same,

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.300
the fifth and sixth series,

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:59.099
the set S is the empty set and Q contains features zero and one.

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:02.914
So another way to calculate that there are two of these sequences,

00:02:02.915 --> 00:02:07.740
is to take S factorial times Q factorial which is two.
