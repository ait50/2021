00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
Calculate the prediction of a tree model given a subset of features.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.830
So we'll implement algorithm one of Scott Lundberg's paper.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.129
So I'm referring to the one that we paste it at the top of this notebook.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.700
Then, you can also see if you go to the paper itself,

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:17.835
we're implementing this algorithm right here.

00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:22.589
So this is a way to use a single trained tree to estimate

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:28.394
predictions of other trees that would be trained on a subset of the features.

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:30.629
So here's a bonus challenge.

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:33.659
Try to implement this function completely by yourself.

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:36.109
So here would be the starter code if you want to

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:40.085
implement this algorithm right here in your own way.

00:00:40.085 --> 00:00:42.424
So this is great practice for you.

00:00:42.424 --> 00:00:47.569
It's okay if you get stuck because we'll also have starter code that you can use as well.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.829
So you can stop here in the video if you want to try it out yourself

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:53.780
or you can continue watching the rest of

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.770
this video and I'll explain a bit about the starter code.
