00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.924
Let's go ahead and calculate the feature importances.

00:00:02.924 --> 00:00:08.160
The importance of feature zero is the importance of a node where it was used

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.800
for splitting which is node two divided by the total node importances.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.365
Similarly, for feature one,

00:00:16.364 --> 00:00:19.184
the importance of feature one is

00:00:19.184 --> 00:00:24.359
the node importance where it was used for splitting which is node zero,

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.064
and divide that by the total node importances.

00:00:28.065 --> 00:00:32.280
Feature two has an importance of zero because it was not used for splitting.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.600
So you can see that the importance of feature zero was 0.66,

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.780
and the importance of feature one is 0.33.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.535
The importance of feature two,

00:00:41.534 --> 00:00:43.109
as we defined, is zero.

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:50.954
So we'll double-check with sklearn model.feature_importances for feature zero,

00:00:50.954 --> 00:00:54.554
model.feature_importances for feature one,

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:58.170
and model.feature_importances for future two.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.179
You can see that, well,

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:01.679
we calculated by hand,

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:04.515
this is the same as what you get from Scikit-learn.

00:01:04.515 --> 00:01:07.670
Great. So, please continue on with the lesson.
