00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.585
So calculate the marginal contribution for a single feature.

00:00:03.585 --> 00:00:05.910
In other words, calculate this.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.179
So fill in the function that takes in the custom tree object,

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.714
just here, a sample data point,

00:00:11.714 --> 00:00:13.469
which is this lowercase x,

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.540
and a list containing the set of features in

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:20.280
set S. So S is a set of features that does not include feature I.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.640
Also, taking the feature for which we want to

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.880
calculate the marginal contribution. So here's a hint.

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:30.824
The Python set class has the number function.add,

00:00:30.824 --> 00:00:36.195
and also note that you may need to use the.copy function as well. Here's what I mean.

00:00:36.195 --> 00:00:40.674
So let's just create some temporary variable,

00:00:40.674 --> 00:00:42.570
and let's create a set,

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.310
let's say contains feature zero.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.730
So now, if we took that set and we did add and let's say we add feature one,

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:00.799
notice now that temp has been modified in place,

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:04.584
so now is a set containing both zero and one.

00:01:04.584 --> 00:01:10.444
So you can imagine if we start with set S and we want to add feature I,

00:01:10.444 --> 00:01:16.069
then we'll be changing the original variable set S. So to avoid doing that,

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:18.379
consider using the copy function.

00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:20.289
So go ahead and try to implement this,

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.030
and then you can check out the solution video.
