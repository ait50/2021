00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.665
Now that we have the node importance is let's calculate the feature importances.

00:00:04.665 --> 00:00:09.255
So to summarize which feature is used to split at each node,

00:00:09.255 --> 00:00:12.825
we can check the feature attribute,

00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:17.550
and from here we can see that feature 0 was used to split on node 2,

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.145
feature 1 was used to split at node 0 and feature 2 was not used for splitting at all.

00:00:23.145 --> 00:00:25.290
You can see there's no number 2 here.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.290
Just to verify, so node 2 at 0, 1,

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.385
2 position 2, that's feature 0,

00:00:32.385 --> 00:00:34.710
and then feature 1 was split at node 0.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.690
So at position 0, you see number 1 right here.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.700
So let's calculate the importance of the features.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.420
The importance of a feature is the importance of the node that

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.530
was used for splitting divided by the total number of importances.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.060
Calculate the importance of features 0, 1, and 2.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.750
When you're done, we can double check it with scikit-learn.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.070
So if we went to the documentation,

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.699
you can see that this attribute feature importances underscore,

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:07.525
is going to be a list that contains a feature importances for each of those features.

00:01:07.525 --> 00:01:09.559
So once you double-check,

00:01:09.559 --> 00:01:13.715
you'll want to see that the feature importance is that we calculated by hand

00:01:13.715 --> 00:01:18.700
are the same ones that you see when you run the scikit-learn function.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.860
Once you're done, please check out the solution video. Thanks.
