00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.069
Now, let's take a look at the algorithm.

00:00:02.069 --> 00:00:06.629
So, here's the algorithm used to calculate the prediction of a tree,

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.745
given a subset of features.

00:00:08.744 --> 00:00:11.070
You can check out the paper Consistent

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.054
Individualized Feature Attribution for Tree Ensembles,

00:00:14.054 --> 00:00:16.679
page 4 algorithm 1.

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:21.359
If I went to the paper itself and I scroll down to page 4,

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.314
in section 3.1, it describes

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:26.850
this simple algorithm and I've actually taken

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.445
a screenshot of this and put it into the Notebook.

00:00:29.445 --> 00:00:31.754
So that's what we're going to go over.

00:00:31.754 --> 00:00:38.325
Back to the Notebook. So, I'll go over each of the variables and describe them.

00:00:38.325 --> 00:00:40.530
Don't worry if you don't get this at first,

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.835
because it takes a while to get used to what all these variables are and also,

00:00:45.835 --> 00:00:48.950
get more comfortable with how they're related to each other.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.515
So, here G is a function.

00:00:51.515 --> 00:00:54.109
You can see that procedure G is defined here,

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:55.585
all the way through here.

00:00:55.585 --> 00:00:58.295
Procedure G is a function that gets called

00:00:58.295 --> 00:01:02.704
recursively to walk down the tree starting at the root node.

00:01:02.704 --> 00:01:07.025
W is the weight given to the predictions of each node.

00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:11.960
You see w being used right here in w times something.

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:15.794
Now, v is the prediction of a leaf node,

00:01:15.795 --> 00:01:18.795
so you can see a v is used here.

00:01:18.795 --> 00:01:23.115
R sub a sub j and r sub b sub j.

00:01:23.114 --> 00:01:24.594
So these r values,

00:01:24.594 --> 00:01:30.289
are the number of data points in the left and right child nodes of a node that's

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.910
defined by index j. R sub j is the number of data points in row j.

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.689
What they're saying is that the r variables are representing the number

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.685
of training samples that are sitting inside a particular node.

00:01:46.685 --> 00:01:53.105
We actually see the r's used in this line of the procedure.

00:01:53.105 --> 00:01:57.560
So now we'll look at the specific parts of this algorithm in more detail.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.460
Feel free to pause here, if you want to look at it on the Notebook yourself.
