00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.430
Now let's look at the original formula.

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.040
So, let's scroll back up a little bit.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.849
The original formula, we're looking at this part of the original formula as

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.425
factorial times quantity M minus S minus one factorial,

00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:15.045
divided by M factorial.

00:00:15.044 --> 00:00:19.620
So, we're putting together all that we've seen to create this formula.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.289
To use the notation of the original formula,

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.960
note that we're going to replace Q with M minus S minus one.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.945
So, that's saying, remember these absolute values are saying the size of those sets.

00:00:32.945 --> 00:00:34.460
So, the size of set M,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.590
the number of total features minus the number of features in set S minus one,

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.275
because we have that feature for which we're trying to calculate the Shapley value,

00:00:44.274 --> 00:00:47.210
and that gives us the size of set Q.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.340
To make this clear for yourself,

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.410
you can just look at some of these examples.

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:54.259
For example, the size of set S is two,

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:58.539
the size of set M is three because there's three total features.

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:01.509
Three minus two minus one,

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:03.475
because we have this feature too,

00:01:03.475 --> 00:01:07.234
gives us zero which is the size of the set Q.

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:10.954
Recall that to calculate that there are six total sequences,

00:01:10.954 --> 00:01:13.414
we can use M factorial,

00:01:13.415 --> 00:01:17.015
which is three factorial which is six in this example.

00:01:17.015 --> 00:01:19.924
So, we're going to divide this expression,

00:01:19.924 --> 00:01:24.620
S factorial times M minus S minus one factorial.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.950
We're going to divide that by M factorial to

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.865
get the proportion assigned to each marginal contribution.

00:01:31.864 --> 00:01:36.664
So, this is the weight that will be applied to each of those marginal contributions.

00:01:36.665 --> 00:01:38.870
Remember when I say marginal contribution,

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.939
I'm just saying how does the model do with

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.524
feature i compared to how does the model do without feature i.

00:01:45.525 --> 00:01:47.955
So, that's the marginal contribution.

00:01:47.954 --> 00:01:51.314
So, that's how we get this formula here.

00:01:51.314 --> 00:01:54.405
Think of this as just a way to say

00:01:54.405 --> 00:02:00.579
this particular marginal contribution may occur more often than others,

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:03.995
so we want to give it more weight in that case.

00:02:03.995 --> 00:02:08.400
For example, sometimes it occurs twice,

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.569
sometimes it only occurs once for instance.

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.194
So, we want to do this for each set,

00:02:14.194 --> 00:02:17.539
which is a subset of M excluding i.

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:22.655
So, we can sum up the weighted marginal contributions for all sets S,

00:02:22.655 --> 00:02:26.539
and this represents the importance of feature i.

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:31.699
So, you'll get to practice this in the code coming up. Thanks for watching.
