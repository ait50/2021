00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.055
So, here's a quick quiz.

00:00:02.055 --> 00:00:06.984
What proportion of samples went to the left child and right child of the root node?

00:00:06.985 --> 00:00:09.960
So, you can actually use the information we

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.915
gave earlier and then calculate the proportion.

00:00:12.914 --> 00:00:16.574
Also, you can take a look at the algorithm as well,

00:00:16.574 --> 00:00:18.824
which is back up here.

00:00:18.824 --> 00:00:20.849
You can see here,

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.915
this might give you some intuition about what we're going to be doing later.

00:00:24.914 --> 00:00:29.280
But for now, just calculate how many training observations went

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.840
to the left child compared to how many came from the parent node?

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.510
So, go ahead and try out in filling out these two lines,

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:38.489
and then, check out the solution.
