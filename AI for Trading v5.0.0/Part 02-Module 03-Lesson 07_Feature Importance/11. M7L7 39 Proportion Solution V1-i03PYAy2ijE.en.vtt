00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.770
Okay. So, what proportion of

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.629
samples went to the left and right child nodes of the root node?

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:08.884
So, first of all, if you'll recall,

00:00:08.884 --> 00:00:14.265
tree zero dot children left looks like this.

00:00:14.265 --> 00:00:19.530
Tree zero dot children right looks like this.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:28.365
We want to work with the tree zero dot weighted n node samples, which is right here.

00:00:28.364 --> 00:00:31.049
So, if we just visually inspect this,

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.285
we're talking about the root node.

00:00:33.284 --> 00:00:38.204
So, the root node starts out with 100 training samples.

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:45.119
Then, we can see that the left child of the root node is node

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:52.195
one and the right child of the root node is node two.

00:00:52.195 --> 00:00:55.575
So node one, you can see here.

00:00:55.575 --> 00:00:59.385
How many weighted n node samples does node one have, the left child?

00:00:59.384 --> 00:01:01.545
It's zero, one. It has 50.

00:01:01.545 --> 00:01:05.325
Okay. How about node two?

00:01:05.325 --> 00:01:07.484
In node two, zero one two,

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:09.254
index zero one two.

00:01:09.254 --> 00:01:13.739
Node two, the right child of the root node has 50 as well.

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:18.689
So, we're going to expect to see 50 divided by 100 for each of those.

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.509
But, let's write this out in code.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.825
So, tree zero dot weighted n node samples

00:01:23.825 --> 00:01:27.890
of the left child of the root node which is one,

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.745
divided by the weighted n node samples for the root node which is node zero.

00:01:34.745 --> 00:01:37.325
Similarly, for the right child,

00:01:37.325 --> 00:01:40.055
tree zero dot weighted n node samples.

00:01:40.055 --> 00:01:43.975
The right child is node two as you can see here,

00:01:43.974 --> 00:01:49.984
and let's divide that by the number of samples in the root node.

00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:54.769
Okay. So, we run that, you can see that it does take 50 divided by 100.

00:01:54.769 --> 00:02:00.469
So, the proportions are 0.5 and 0.5. Awesome.
