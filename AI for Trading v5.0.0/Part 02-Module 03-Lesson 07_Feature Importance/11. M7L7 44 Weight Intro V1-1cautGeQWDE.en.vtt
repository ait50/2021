00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So calculate the weight on the marginal contribution

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.929
or calculate the weight placed on the marginal contribution of the feature.

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:09.059
So this is this term right here.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.405
You might recognize it from a previous exercise.

00:00:12.404 --> 00:00:14.564
So go ahead and implement it.

00:00:14.564 --> 00:00:17.804
If you want, you can take a peek at the previous exercise.

00:00:17.804 --> 00:00:20.689
But once you're done, please check out the solution video.
