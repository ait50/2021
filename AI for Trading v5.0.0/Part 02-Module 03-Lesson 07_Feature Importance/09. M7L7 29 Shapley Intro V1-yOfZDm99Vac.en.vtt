00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.444
Great. So now we have all the pieces.

00:00:02.444 --> 00:00:06.060
So let's calculate the Shapley value for our feature zero.

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:08.234
So for a single observation,

00:00:08.234 --> 00:00:11.834
where feature zero is one and feature one is also one,

00:00:11.835 --> 00:00:13.605
feature two is also one,

00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:16.320
calculate the Shapley value of feature

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.519
zero as the weighted sum of the differences in predictions.

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:25.649
So notice here, those diff variables that we calculated for cases A, B, C,

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:28.904
and D, that's this expression here,

00:00:28.905 --> 00:00:30.629
and the weight that we calculated,

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:34.609
which is actually that expression with the factorials,

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:38.509
we stored in the variables called weight A, B,

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:42.500
C, and D. This summation is just saying sum across all of those.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.585
So go ahead and do that.

00:00:44.585 --> 00:00:48.170
Then, when you're done, you can verify with the Shap library.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.914
So the Shap library is written by Scott Lundberg,

00:00:50.914 --> 00:00:54.174
the creator of Shapley Additive Explanations.

00:00:54.174 --> 00:00:56.594
So here's a link to it.

00:00:56.594 --> 00:00:58.725
Here's the GitHub repo.

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:00.344
But we've already installed it.

00:01:00.344 --> 00:01:02.284
So we can actually call it this way.

00:01:02.284 --> 00:01:03.799
So from the Shap library,

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:07.759
create a TreeExplainer and pass in the model.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.704
This is the model that we trained initially with all three features.

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:18.295
Then, call shap_values and pass in this NumPy array of one, one, one.

00:01:18.295 --> 00:01:20.340
So when you print this out,

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.310
you'll see the Shap value that we calculated by hand with our own code,

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.340
and also the one from the Shap library itself.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.094
So these two should match.

00:01:30.094 --> 00:01:33.575
We didn't calculate the Shapley values for features one and two,

00:01:33.575 --> 00:01:35.630
but we'll print this out as well.

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:39.579
So this will help when we think about what this means.

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:42.890
Go ahead and try it out and then check out the solution video.
