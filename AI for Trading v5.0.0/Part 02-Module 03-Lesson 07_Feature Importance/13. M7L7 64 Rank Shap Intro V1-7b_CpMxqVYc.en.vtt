00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.145
Rank features using SHAP.

00:00:02.145 --> 00:00:04.033
There are a couple of classes,

00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:05.445
one for each quintile.

00:00:05.445 --> 00:00:11.714
So the list returned by shap_values function has one element for each of those classes.

00:00:11.714 --> 00:00:14.969
We'll explore how to get the absolute values and then

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.969
average of those absolute values for each of the features.

00:00:17.969 --> 00:00:20.744
Then, we can put that code into a function.

00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:24.060
So remember, here's the formula to aggregate

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:27.929
local feature importances into global feature importances.

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:32.939
First, we can concatenate the 2D arrays in the list shap_values.

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:36.119
So a shap_values as a list of matrices.

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:38.309
If we use numpy.concatenate,

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.950
we can see that they're just stacking all the rows on top of each other.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.630
So we still have 21 columns,

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.695
but we have five times as many rows.

00:00:48.695 --> 00:00:52.840
We can use numpy.absolute value like this.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.565
Then, we can use numpy.nanmean.

00:00:56.564 --> 00:00:59.089
If we want to take the average for each column,

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.525
we set axis equal to zero.

00:01:01.524 --> 00:01:05.239
So for the quiz, please try to implement the function that

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.349
calculates global feature importance using Shapley values,

00:01:08.349 --> 00:01:10.819
and then sorts the features by importance.

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:12.918
So it's your choice as a challenge,

00:01:12.918 --> 00:01:15.295
you can just implement it from scratch.

00:01:15.295 --> 00:01:19.924
If you get stuck, then you can also work with the starter code.

00:01:19.924 --> 00:01:24.079
When you're done, try out your function and then see how your features are ranked.

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:26.829
Then, you can also check out the solution video.
