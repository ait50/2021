00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
Okay. So, when both classes are 50 percent,

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.955
what is the impurity?

00:00:05.955 --> 00:00:11.265
So, frequency is 0.5 for both.

00:00:11.265 --> 00:00:13.964
Let's type all this formula,

00:00:13.964 --> 00:00:18.914
which is actually the same thing that you see right here, but let's just type it out.

00:00:18.914 --> 00:00:21.899
So, negative one times frequency one,

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:24.329
times one minus frequency one,

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:28.889
plus minus one times frequency two,

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.100
times one minus frequency two.

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:37.019
We say they're variable in impurity, printed it out.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.150
So, you can see that when is evenly split between these two frequencies,

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.619
then the impurity is negative 0.5.

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:49.195
So, now the question is asking,

00:00:49.195 --> 00:00:52.460
is the impurity larger or smaller when the sample,

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.439
in magnitude absolute value,

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:57.304
when the samples are dominated by a single class?

00:00:57.304 --> 00:01:00.929
So, essentially, we're comparing this case

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:05.170
when one was 90 percent and the other was 0.01,

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.715
versus when they were evenly split.

00:01:07.715 --> 00:01:09.920
So, in terms of absolute values,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:17.325
you can see that 0.18 is smaller closer to zero compared to 0.5.

00:01:17.325 --> 00:01:23.340
So, impurity is smaller in magnitude when

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.954
samples are dominated by a single class,

00:01:29.954 --> 00:01:33.405
that's the 90 percent, 10 percent example.

00:01:33.405 --> 00:01:35.870
The second question is very similar,

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.329
is the impurity larger or smaller when

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.704
the frequency of each class is more evenly distributed among classes?

00:01:41.704 --> 00:01:45.609
So, the impurity is larger in magnitude

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:51.724
when samples are more evenly distributed among classes.

00:01:51.724 --> 00:01:55.879
That's the 50 percent, 50 percent example.

00:01:55.879 --> 00:02:00.109
Great. Please continue on with the lesson. Thanks.
