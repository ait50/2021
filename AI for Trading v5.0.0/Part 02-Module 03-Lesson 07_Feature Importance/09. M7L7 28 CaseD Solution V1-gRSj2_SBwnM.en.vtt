00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
Okay. So let's go ahead and implement Case D.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:09.375
So S_union_i will use the get_subset function,

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:12.480
pass in the set of all features,

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.990
and we're going to grab just feature zero.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.839
F_S_union_i is going to contain an instance

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:20.910
of a decision tree regressors,

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.089
so sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor,

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:31.155
and we're going to fit it to the data S_union_i,

00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:33.945
which contains just feature zero,

00:00:33.945 --> 00:00:36.465
and the labels are in y.

00:00:36.465 --> 00:00:41.655
So the sample input is just going to be a single value of one,

00:00:41.655 --> 00:00:44.475
and we're going to reshape it,

00:00:44.475 --> 00:00:47.230
so that it has one row,

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:56.310
then we'll do a prediction with this model on the sample input.

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.009
So it's going to be 0.5.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:08.004
Now next, how would the model predict if it had no features to train on?

00:01:08.004 --> 00:01:13.119
So this is actually just going to be the average of all the labels,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.535
so if we looked at y,

00:01:15.534 --> 00:01:19.239
you see that one-fourth of them have a value of one,

00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:22.324
and the other three-fourths has a value of zero.

00:01:22.325 --> 00:01:29.245
So we can expect if we just take the average of the labels,

00:01:29.245 --> 00:01:32.725
then that's the prediction that the model would make.

00:01:32.724 --> 00:01:34.824
When there's no features,

00:01:34.825 --> 00:01:37.159
it will predict 0.25.

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.215
So let's calculate the difference which is the prediction

00:01:41.215 --> 00:01:46.329
of S_union_i minus the prediction thathas S.

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:53.769
So the difference is 0.5 minus 0.25, which is 0.25.

00:01:53.769 --> 00:01:56.119
Last step is to calculate the weight.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.375
So the size of set S, the empty set,

00:01:59.375 --> 00:02:03.019
is zero, the empty set has a size of zero,

00:02:03.019 --> 00:02:06.295
and let's calculate the weight.

00:02:06.295 --> 00:02:13.159
Remember, we input size S and also the total number of features,

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:15.465
and the weight is one-third,

00:02:15.465 --> 00:02:18.310
as we expect from this formula here.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.560
Great. So now, we can calculate Shapley value.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.420
So check out the next video for that.
