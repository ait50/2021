00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.129
Okay, so the quiz is asking us to calculate the node importance of node two.

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:08.519
So it's quite similar to what we did up here.

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.230
We're going to get the weighted number of

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.579
samples for node two times the impurity of node two,

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.695
and then compare that to the impurities of its children.

00:00:25.695 --> 00:00:28.560
We're getting node samples.

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:33.254
So its left child is node three,

00:00:33.255 --> 00:00:37.125
and its right child is node four.

00:00:37.125 --> 00:00:40.149
So we get the node samples.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.484
So the importance of node two is 25.

00:00:45.484 --> 00:00:47.179
Okay, and just a reminder,

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:48.770
the other node are leaf nodes,

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.580
so there's no decrease in impurity that we can calculate.

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.074
So sum up the node importances.

00:00:55.075 --> 00:00:59.555
So that's just the importance of node zero plus the importance of node two.

00:00:59.554 --> 00:01:03.394
So that's the total of the node importances.

00:01:03.395 --> 00:01:07.159
Great, so please continue on with the lesson to

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.019
learn about calculating the importances of the features. Thanks.
