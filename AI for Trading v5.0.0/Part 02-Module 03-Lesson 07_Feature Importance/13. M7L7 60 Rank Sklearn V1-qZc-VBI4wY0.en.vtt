00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
Rank features by feature importance with sklearn.

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.490
We'll define a function that uses the built-in sklearn feature importances,

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.730
and source the features by their feature importance.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.320
Note that there's a numpy.argsort function that returns a list of

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.050
the original index locations of a list

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.995
in the order that would make them sorted in ascending order.

00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:24.825
Here's a small example,

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:28.785
if we were to sort this list that's 10, 30, and 20.

00:00:28.785 --> 00:00:31.079
You can see that it's saying,

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:35.210
first put the value from index to zero which is 10,

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.355
and the value from index two which is 20,

00:00:38.354 --> 00:00:42.064
and then finally the value at index one which is 30.

00:00:42.064 --> 00:00:44.530
So now, it would be 10, 20, 30.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.870
Now, another tip, one way to reverse the order of a list or array is to

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:50.989
use the notation, ::-1.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.640
So for instance, three, two,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.414
one can be reversed to be one, two, three.

00:00:55.414 --> 00:00:59.329
So go ahead and fill in this function and this will let

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.439
us sort the features by their feature importance.

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:06.519
