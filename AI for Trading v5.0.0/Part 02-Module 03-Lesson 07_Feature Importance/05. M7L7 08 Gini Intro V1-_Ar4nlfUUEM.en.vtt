00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.424
Now, let's look at Gini impurity and practice calculating in code.

00:00:04.424 --> 00:00:09.179
So, Gini impurity like entropy is a way to measure how disorganized the observations

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.324
are before and after splitting them using a feature.

00:00:14.324 --> 00:00:18.149
So, there's an impurity value calculated for each node.

00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:22.424
In the formula, frequency sub I over here,

00:00:22.425 --> 00:00:25.140
is the frequency of label I.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.455
C is the number of unique labels at that node.

00:00:28.454 --> 00:00:32.250
So, in this case, C stands for a class, as in classifier.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.664
So, here's some practice examples.

00:00:34.664 --> 00:00:38.024
What is the impurity if there's a single class?

00:00:38.024 --> 00:00:40.515
So, that means that the frequency sub zero,

00:00:40.515 --> 00:00:42.655
is one per 100 percent,

00:00:42.655 --> 00:00:45.995
and the impurity we use this formula, negative one,

00:00:45.994 --> 00:00:49.339
times the frequency of this class,

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.790
times one, minus the frequency.

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:54.518
So, if you print out the impurity,

00:00:54.518 --> 00:00:59.704
impurity of a homogeneous sample with a single label is zero.

00:00:59.704 --> 00:01:01.774
The next example is,

00:01:01.774 --> 00:01:03.559
what is the impurity if there are

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.015
two classes and there are 90 percent of samples for one label,

00:01:08.015 --> 00:01:09.859
and 10 percent for the other?

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:17.859
So, this is saying frequency sub one is 0.9 and frequency sub two is 0.1.

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:22.495
So, again, we just implement this formula that we see here.

00:01:22.495 --> 00:01:26.400
Negative one, times the frequency sub one times one,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.290
minus frequency sub one then plus,

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.280
because we're doing a summation here,

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.859
negative one times frequency sub two,

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:36.290
times one minus frequency sub two.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.470
So, the impurity when 90 percent are of one label,

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:43.135
and 10 percent are of the other, is negative 0.18.

00:01:43.135 --> 00:01:44.815
So, it's no longer zero.

00:01:44.814 --> 00:01:47.149
In absolute values, it's more than zero,

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.250
in absolute value terms.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.665
So, try out this quiz.

00:01:51.665 --> 00:01:54.785
What is the impurity if there are two classes of label,

00:01:54.784 --> 00:01:59.974
and there are 50 percent of samples for one label and 50 percent for the other?

00:01:59.974 --> 00:02:02.125
So, once you try it out,

00:02:02.125 --> 00:02:03.689
try to answer these questions.

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.310
Is the impurity larger or smaller in magnitude,

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.884
in terms of absolute value,

00:02:08.884 --> 00:02:12.484
when the samples are dominated by a single class?

00:02:12.485 --> 00:02:17.955
Second question, is the impurity larger or smaller in magnitude,

00:02:17.955 --> 00:02:19.695
in terms of absolute value,

00:02:19.694 --> 00:02:25.044
when the frequency of each class is more evenly distributed among classes?

00:02:25.044 --> 00:02:27.084
Go ahead and try this out,

00:02:27.085 --> 00:02:31.170
answer these questions and then check out the solution video. Thanks.
