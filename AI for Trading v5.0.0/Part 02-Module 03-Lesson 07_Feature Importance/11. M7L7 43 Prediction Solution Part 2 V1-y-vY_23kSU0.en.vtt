00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
So now, after we've defined this F given S, let's test it out.

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.189
So in this case, sample values are going to be one for all three features,

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:13.649
and the subset S is just going to say,

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.875
we only want to look at feature two as if the model only knew about feature two.

00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:22.920
Okay. So we expect because feature two doesn't

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.980
actually help with any of the models prediction,

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.304
is actually going to be a simple average of all the labels which is going to be 0.25.

00:00:31.304 --> 00:00:34.725
Okay. Great. So we see that it's 0.25.

00:00:34.725 --> 00:00:37.289
Let's also test the empty set.

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:42.269
So if S contains the set of just nothing,

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.580
then we also expect the output to be 0.25, Great.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.350
So we see it 0.25.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.490
Great. So now you've calculated F given S and tested it out.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.100
So please continue on with the lesson.
