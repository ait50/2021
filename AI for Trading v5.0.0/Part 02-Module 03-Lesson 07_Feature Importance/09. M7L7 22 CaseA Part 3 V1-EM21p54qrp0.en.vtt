00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.655
Now let's calculate, how do model performance if it only has feature one?

00:00:04.655 --> 00:00:07.535
So we use this function to say,

00:00:07.535 --> 00:00:10.414
"Okay, let's just grab feature one."

00:00:10.414 --> 00:00:15.074
Let's also create another decision tree and we'll fit the data,

00:00:15.074 --> 00:00:17.384
we'll fit the model to the data.

00:00:17.385 --> 00:00:22.140
So the sample input for feature one is one because remember in this case,

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.490
we were choosing an observation where all the features would be

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:32.460
one and we're going to use re-shape to make sure that it has the correct dimensions.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.570
Okay. So, the model's prediction when it only takes feature one is 0.5.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.189
So, when feature one is one,

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:44.234
then the prediction of the model 0.5.

00:00:44.234 --> 00:00:45.969
If you look at the data in x,

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:49.969
this makes sense because when feature one is one,

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:56.869
half the time the label in y is zero and half of the time the label and Y is one.

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:59.489
So on average, the prediction is 0.5.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.770
So what I mean by that is, if you look at the data,

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.710
sample data that we created.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:11.504
So feature one is this column in the middle and the labels,

00:01:11.504 --> 00:01:12.839
I'll create a new cell for that,

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.230
the labels are in Y.

00:01:19.129 --> 00:01:24.750
This middle column is the value one. What are the labels?

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.599
Half of the time the labels are one and half of the time the labels are zero.

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:33.099
In the case when this middle column is one.

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:36.799
So that's why the model's predicting that the output of

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.450
the model would be 0.5 if it only knows about this middle column.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.109
Okay. So once we've gotten the prediction of the model,

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:49.489
with S including I and take the difference from that

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:54.769
from when the model only knows set S. Then here's the difference.

00:01:54.769 --> 00:01:59.959
This is essentially saying the prediction of S union I which is one,

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:01.569
which we saw up here,

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:07.969
the prediction of S union I is one minus the prediction when it's just the set S,

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.689
which is 0.51 minus 0.5 is 0.5.

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:13.189
Okay. Last step is,

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:16.685
calculate the weight assigned to the marginal contribution.

00:02:16.685 --> 00:02:18.935
In other words, what are those factorials?

00:02:18.935 --> 00:02:22.069
In this case, if the marginal contribution occurs one

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.069
out of the six possible permutations of the features then

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.680
its weight would be one sixth and we can

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.370
verify that by going ahead and using that function.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.730
So remember we're passing in the size of set S, okay?

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.945
The size of set S is one.

00:02:38.944 --> 00:02:40.625
We can verify that as well.

00:02:40.625 --> 00:02:46.215
Size S is one and so the weight is one sixth.

00:02:46.215 --> 00:02:47.460
We can verify that again.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.795
One divided by six is what we get here.

00:02:50.794 --> 00:02:53.329
Great. So now continue onto the next video that

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.260
introduces case B which you'll try in the quiz. Thanks.
