00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.535
Okay. So now let's fill in this starter code for shap_ feature_ I.

00:00:05.535 --> 00:00:12.089
First S list, is generate all subsets of S and put it into S list.

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:13.679
So if we go back up,

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.030
and in our book we can see where we defined the function for that.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.970
So this generate all subsets,

00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:25.094
and it takes in a set of features.

00:00:25.094 --> 00:00:29.489
So now we want to note that the list of S,

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.295
remember S, if we look at the formula,

00:00:33.295 --> 00:00:37.414
is all the subsets where they're excluding feature I.

00:00:37.414 --> 00:00:40.729
Okay. So, to exclude feature I,

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:44.349
we want to use all features minus I in here.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.390
So we don't want to use all features.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.730
Now let's initialize phi.

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:53.029
So phi, recall this formula,

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:00.260
phi is going to be storing the sum of all these terms, all these products.

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:04.355
And so, we will initialize it to zero.

00:01:04.355 --> 00:01:08.344
The total number of features is just the length of this all features,

00:01:08.343 --> 00:01:11.314
dictionary or set actually.

00:01:11.314 --> 00:01:18.634
Now let's iterate through all the subsets S. So when we iterate,

00:01:18.635 --> 00:01:21.530
think of this as, hear in the summation is going through

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.284
all the subsets S that exclude feature I.

00:01:25.284 --> 00:01:28.500
Okay. So, we'll come back to this in a bit,

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.349
but first, phi is going to be adding up all those products.

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:35.614
So if I go back to the formula,

00:01:35.614 --> 00:01:40.214
it's going to be adding up the weight times the marginal contribution,

00:01:40.215 --> 00:01:43.355
and both of these are already defined as functions.

00:01:43.355 --> 00:01:45.600
So let's go look for that.

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:48.109
Okay. So we have the weight on

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:53.414
the marginal contribution as well as the marginal contribution of feature.

00:01:53.415 --> 00:01:58.440
So I'm going to go ahead and save both of these on the clipboard.

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.524
So there's the weight,

00:02:00.525 --> 00:02:04.270
and there's also the marginal contribution.

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:10.055
Let's go back down to our function.

00:02:10.055 --> 00:02:12.830
So here, we have the weight on

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.855
the marginal contribution times the marginal contribution of the feature.

00:02:17.854 --> 00:02:20.679
So now let's update these arguments.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.235
So, remember size S is the size

00:02:25.235 --> 00:02:29.690
of that subset S. One thing to know is that we use the keyword,

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:34.234
none to represent the empty set.

00:02:34.235 --> 00:02:40.470
And so, even though if we used the length function to calculate the length of a set,

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:44.555
it will count none as one incremental value.

00:02:44.555 --> 00:02:46.325
So we want to exclude that.

00:02:46.324 --> 00:02:50.000
So what I mean is that we want the size S to be the length of

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.125
S minus one in the case when none is part of that subset.

00:02:54.125 --> 00:03:00.455
Otherwise, the size S could just be the length of S. So that's this right here.

00:03:00.455 --> 00:03:04.370
Now instead of M, we're just getting the number of total features.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.200
That's what M stands for.

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:08.060
Then, so for here,

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.150
the marginal contribution, the feature, the tree,

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.615
we just reuse the tree that we're passing here,

00:03:14.615 --> 00:03:16.975
X we also reuse.

00:03:16.974 --> 00:03:20.294
So let me put this on a new line.

00:03:20.294 --> 00:03:26.399
S, this subset S is what we got from here,

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.090
and feature I is what we got from up here.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.759
Okay. Let's just put this back on one line.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.800
Okay. So let's try out the function.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:48.625
And you can see here that if we calculate the feature importance of feature zero,

00:03:48.625 --> 00:03:51.110
then we get 0.375.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.440
This may look familiar from the previous exercise that we

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:58.104
did where we also calculated 0.375.

00:03:58.104 --> 00:04:02.500
All right, thanks for going through this and please continue on with the lesson.
