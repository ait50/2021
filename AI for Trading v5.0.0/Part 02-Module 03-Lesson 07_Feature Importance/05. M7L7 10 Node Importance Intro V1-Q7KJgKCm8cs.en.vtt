00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.714
Now let's calculate the node importance.

00:00:02.714 --> 00:00:05.910
The node importance in sklearn is calculated as

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.255
the difference between the Gini impurity of the node,

00:00:09.255 --> 00:00:13.620
the parent node, and the impurities of its child nodes.

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:19.155
These Gini impurities are weighted by the number of data points that reach each node.

00:00:19.155 --> 00:00:21.839
So if we think, for instance,

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:26.850
the root node has a certain impurity that we calculate and

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:32.070
its left and right child each also has a Gini impurity that we can calculate.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.799
So we can see that we're getting the difference between the parent node and

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:41.219
its child nodes and we're also weighting them by

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.024
how many samples actually filtered into the left or right node.

00:00:46.024 --> 00:00:50.405
So here's just a quick summary of the node labels and we can actually

00:00:50.405 --> 00:00:55.280
see this from checking out the children left and children right lists.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.115
But node zero is the root node and its left and right children are node one and node two.

00:01:01.115 --> 00:01:03.535
Node one is a leaf node,

00:01:03.534 --> 00:01:05.810
node two has two children,

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.969
which are node three and node four and those are also leaf nodes.

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:15.679
Just to show you again this visual is the same thing.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.140
So here's node zero,

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.019
node one, node two,

00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:20.459
node three, node four.

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:23.689
So you can take a look at this visual as well.

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.469
Okay. Back to node importance.

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:27.969
So here's an example.

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:31.989
Calculate the node importance of the root node, node zero.

00:01:31.989 --> 00:01:35.604
Remember its child nodes are node one and two.

00:01:35.605 --> 00:01:37.630
So I'm just going to type this out.

00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:39.894
So we can look at it slowly.

00:01:39.894 --> 00:01:43.479
So the node importance of the root node,

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.810
node zero is the number of samples in the root node.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:56.680
That's the weight times the impurity of the root node. All right.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.710
So that is this part of the formula right

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:04.449
here and then subtract the impurities of the children.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.270
So tree the weighted node samples of the left child,

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.750
which is node one times the impurity node one.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.889
Okay and also include the weighted and node samples of the right child,

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:30.679
which is node two and then multiplied by the impurity of node two.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.570
All right. So the importance of node zero is 12.5.

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.180
For the quiz, you'll do something quite similar.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.170
So calculate the node importance of node two and remember that

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:49.164
its left and right child nodes are three and four and when you're done with that,

00:02:49.164 --> 00:02:51.370
sum up the node importances.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.349
So only node zero and two have node importances

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:59.689
because they are the only ones that actually have a feature that splits.

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:01.775
The others are leaf nodes.

00:03:01.775 --> 00:03:03.635
So once you're done with that,

00:03:03.634 --> 00:03:06.799
please check out the solution video. Thanks.
