00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.285
Okay. So let's calculate the weight on the marginal contribution,

00:00:03.285 --> 00:00:07.650
given the size of set S and also M is the number of total features.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:17.640
So it's going to be S factorial times M

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.135
minus S minus 1

00:00:21.135 --> 00:00:29.310
factorial divided by M factorial.

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:33.070
Great. Please continue on to the next part of the lesson.
