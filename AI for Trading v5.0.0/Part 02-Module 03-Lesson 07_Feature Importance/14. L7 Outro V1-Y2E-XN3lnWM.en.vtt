00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
In this lesson, you've learned about the need to be able to interpret

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.574
complex models and to identify which features are important to model's prediction.

00:00:10.574 --> 00:00:14.969
You've also learned how feature importance is implemented in scikit-learn,

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.780
as well as how sharply additive explanations are implemented.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.920
Finally, you also practice ranking features by their importance to

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.120
a model in order to limit your model to the most relevant features.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:33.179
Next, you'll get to combine all that you've learned in the alpha combination project.

00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:35.899
Good luck and have fun.
