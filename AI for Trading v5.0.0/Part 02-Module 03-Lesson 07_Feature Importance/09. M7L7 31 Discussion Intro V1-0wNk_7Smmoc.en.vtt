00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.365
So now let's discuss if these results make sense to us.

00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:07.995
The shap library outputs the shap values for feature 0,

00:00:07.995 --> 00:00:10.890
1, and 2 which is what we see here.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.825
We can see that the Shapley value for feature 0 matches what we calculated.

00:00:15.825 --> 00:00:18.400
We calculated 0.375.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.205
The Shapley value for feature 1 is also given the same importance as feature 0.

00:00:23.205 --> 00:00:26.835
So feature 1 also has a 0.375.

00:00:26.835 --> 00:00:29.160
So let's think about some of these questions.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.924
Given that the training data is simulating the AND operator,

00:00:32.924 --> 00:00:35.775
do you think that these values make sense?

00:00:35.775 --> 00:00:39.060
Next, do you think feature 0 and 1 are equally

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.585
important or is one more important than the other?

00:00:42.585 --> 00:00:47.795
Does the importance of feature 2 make sense as well because it's zero.

00:00:47.795 --> 00:00:50.975
So now think back to the previous exercise,

00:00:50.975 --> 00:00:54.805
and when we looked at how scikit-learn implements feature importance.

00:00:54.805 --> 00:01:00.020
How does this compare to the feature importance method in scikit-learn?

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.320
Think this over and then check out the solution video.
