Okay. So test three is a case when feature zero and one are one,

00:00:05.384 --> 00:00:08.250
and feature two is zero,

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.064
it can actually be zero or a one.

00:00:10.064 --> 00:00:11.984
You want to fight the prediction.

00:00:11.984 --> 00:00:16.289
So we can first double-check that the shap function that

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.759
we calculated gives the same result as the shap library.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.100
So you can pause the video for a bit to think about how you would interpret this.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.415
I'm going to go ahead and give my thoughts here.

00:00:29.414 --> 00:00:34.820
So here you can see that we start out with the expected value of 0.25.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.630
Each of these features,

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.039
features zero and feature one,

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:45.399
are pushing the model's prediction in a positive direction by an equal amount of 0.375.

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:47.564
When you add these up,

00:00:47.564 --> 00:00:50.280
you actually get 0.75.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.200
Now you'll notice that the information from the features has pushed

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.840
the expected value from 0.25 to the model's prediction of one.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.950
The nice thing is, and you'll notice this from the previous exercises, in this case,

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.950
it's saying that features zero and one here are

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.930
equally important in contributing to the final prediction.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.695
Because they have the same sign and same magnitude.

00:01:14.694 --> 00:01:17.494
Great. So thank you for going through this notebook.

00:01:17.495 --> 00:01:19.700
We're done with this. The solution notebook link

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.769
is here as well, if you want to look at that.

00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:24.329
You can continue on with the lesson.
