00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.089
Okay. So first let's get the feature importance from

00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:06.839
the model and here the variable M is the model.

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.219
We can get feature importance like so,

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.490
and then sort the importances in descending order,

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.309
and store the indices of that sort okay.

00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:22.664
So, if you did it numpy.argsort of the importances,

00:00:22.664 --> 00:00:24.869
that would be in ascending order.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.750
So let's make it descending order.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.045
So if we run this,

00:00:30.045 --> 00:00:32.789
we can check out the model importances,

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:35.339
and you can see [inaudible].

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.200
So the most important one is on top,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.140
and then the least important is on the bottom,

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.929
and as well you can see the value associated with that feature importance.
