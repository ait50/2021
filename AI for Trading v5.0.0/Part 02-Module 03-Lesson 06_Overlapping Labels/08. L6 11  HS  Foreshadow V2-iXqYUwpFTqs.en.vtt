00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.024
So far, in these lessons,

00:00:02.024 --> 00:00:03.764
you've learned a ton about using

00:00:03.765 --> 00:00:07.394
decision tree models to build high performing trading strategies.

00:00:07.394 --> 00:00:10.439
You've gained insights about the algorithms themselves,

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:14.070
how they work on the inside and also the data themselves,

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.390
how to engineer features to be most useful and how to generate labels.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.420
In this lesson, you learned about a particular problem with

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.895
correlated labels that comes up frequently in financial machine learning applications.

00:00:26.894 --> 00:00:29.730
What if you've done everything we taught you,

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.469
your model works really well,

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:34.049
and you're trying to convince the portfolio manager to

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:37.034
use it as the basis of a major trading strategy?

00:00:37.034 --> 00:00:39.179
You want to tell her all about it,

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:40.454
your use of data,

00:00:40.454 --> 00:00:42.070
the design decisions you made,

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.715
and the model's predictions.

00:00:43.715 --> 00:00:46.970
How do you explain to her why and how it works,

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.429
which of the features you created are the most predictive?

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:52.039
In other words, how can we interpret the model,

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.655
and also identify which features are most relevant in its decision-making?

00:00:56.655 --> 00:00:59.859
This is what you'll get to learn about in the next lesson.
