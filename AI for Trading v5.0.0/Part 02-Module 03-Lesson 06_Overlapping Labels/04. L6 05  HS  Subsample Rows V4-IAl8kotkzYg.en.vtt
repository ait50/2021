00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.485
The simplest solution to this problem is to just sub-sample

00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:10.214
the rows of the original data set so that the labels do not overlap in time.

00:00:10.214 --> 00:00:14.009
In other words, if you are calculating weekly returns,

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.850
you would just use the weekly returns of non-overlapping weeks.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.465
That is the weekly returns every Friday for example.

00:00:21.464 --> 00:00:24.239
This is commonly done in production models.

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:29.234
However, the downside to this option is the loss of data from those other periods.

00:00:29.234 --> 00:00:32.219
If you're using the monthly or yearly returns,

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.369
you might already have relatively few data points and

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:38.804
be very keen to maximize the potential of the data you have.

00:00:38.804 --> 00:00:41.280
So what else can you try?
