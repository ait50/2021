00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.894
Another possibility involves adjusting

00:00:02.894 --> 00:00:06.240
the bagging procedure inside the random forest model.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.480
The idea is to pick a smaller number of samples for

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.949
each bag in order to reduce the influence of redundant information.

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:19.859
Changing the bag size is not an option within scikit-learn random forest implementations.

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.980
For these models, the number of rows in each bag is

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.475
always the same as the number of rows in the original dataset.

00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:30.690
However, scikit-learn does offer another classifier called bagging

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.929
classifier that allows you to adjust the bag size with a parameter called max samples.
