00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.870
The core problem is that if every day we calculate, say weekly returns,

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:13.185
then the weekly return on a given day will be correlated with the weekly returns

00:00:13.185 --> 00:00:19.105
of the day's surrounding it because they draw on data from the same time period.

00:00:19.105 --> 00:00:24.120
This is a problem for lots of Machine Learning models which frequently rely on

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:30.855
the assumption that each data row is independent and identically distributed, or IID.

00:00:30.855 --> 00:00:33.734
In the case of random forests,

00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:35.579
if the bootstrap samples for

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.849
individual decision trees are made on highly overlapping labels,

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.929
then observations within the bag are likely to be similar to each other,

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:48.320
and also similar to observations outside the bag.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.355
The individual decision trees are likely to be similar.

00:00:52.354 --> 00:00:55.339
The forest error rate depends on

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.510
the correlation between predictions made by the trees in the forest.

00:00:59.509 --> 00:01:02.960
If the algorithm is trained on correlated rows,

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.855
it will produce a forest of correlated trees,

00:01:05.855 --> 00:01:11.225
and this will increase the rate of classification error made by the forest.

00:01:11.224 --> 00:01:16.759
Furthermore, because the in-bag samples are similar to the out-of-bag ones,

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.545
the out-of-bag error rate is likely to be inflated.

00:01:20.545 --> 00:01:22.870
In the next few videos,

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.760
we'll talk about a few of the approaches you can take to

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.810
mitigate this problem if you're using a random forest model.
