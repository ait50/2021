00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.845
As we mentioned before,

00:00:01.845 --> 00:00:05.294
if features are inputs to a supervised learning model,

00:00:05.294 --> 00:00:07.544
then the targets, also called labels,

00:00:07.544 --> 00:00:09.269
are the outputs of the model.

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.699
In the last lesson, you learned how to create

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:15.765
several features that may be useful for improving your model's performance.

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:19.515
The features help by providing context about market conditions,

00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:22.394
which are useful in the decision-making of the model.

00:00:22.394 --> 00:00:25.984
You also learned how to create targets or labels that

00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:29.780
allow the model to work well in changing market conditions.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.500
In this section, we're going to talk about a particular problem with

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.615
the labels that applications of machine learning to finance frequently encounter.

00:00:38.615 --> 00:00:40.984
We've heard a bit about this issue already.

00:00:40.984 --> 00:00:45.140
It has to do with what happens when the labels are not independent.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.869
This violates a core assumption of many of

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:50.554
the machine-learning algorithms we would like to use.

00:00:50.554 --> 00:00:53.530
Let's learn a bit more about this issue.
