00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.430
Another possibility is based on

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.790
the observation that if we're working with weekly returns,

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.379
there are five different sets of non-overlapping labels we could use,

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.519
depending on which day of the week we calculate the returns from.

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.489
The idea is to train separate,

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:19.769
random forest models on each set of

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:24.679
non-overlapping labels and then ensemble these together.
