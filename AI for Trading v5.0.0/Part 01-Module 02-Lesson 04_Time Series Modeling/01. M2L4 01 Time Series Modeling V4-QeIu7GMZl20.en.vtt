00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.194
Welcome to the lesson on time series analysis.

00:00:03.194 --> 00:00:07.345
Time series are data that are collected at regular intervals.

00:00:07.344 --> 00:00:10.050
We will cover two statistical methods,

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.265
autoregression and moving averages.

00:00:12.265 --> 00:00:16.269
This will give us the foundation to cover two more advanced methods,

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:21.504
autoregressive moving averages and autoregressive integrated moving averages.

00:00:21.504 --> 00:00:25.114
From there, we will cover two machine-learning methods.

00:00:25.114 --> 00:00:27.009
The first is Kalman filters,

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.490
and the more generalized, particle filters.

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:32.674
The second is recurrent neural networks.

00:00:32.674 --> 00:00:34.454
Let's get started.

00:00:34.454 --> 00:00:38.299
Let's think a bit about what a stock price time series looks like.

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:41.589
Most stock prices increase over time.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.915
Sadly, some stock prices also decrease over time.

00:00:45.914 --> 00:00:48.875
This means that the price shows a trend.

00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:53.929
This makes analyzing the prices difficult since the prices are non-stationary.

00:00:53.929 --> 00:01:00.679
By non-stationary, we mean that the data's mean and standard deviation change over time.

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:06.260
The goal of time series analysis is to use past data to predict future values.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.560
So, if the properties of the data change over time,

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.240
the past is less useful in predicting the future.

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:17.549
To work with data that is more likely to be stationary, and therefore,

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.579
easier to model, we use stock returns and not stock prices.

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:28.079
Moreover, to work with data that is more stationary and more normally distributed,

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:30.674
we use the log of stock returns,

00:01:30.674 --> 00:01:33.129
which we call log returns.
