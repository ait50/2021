00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
When we look at log returns of a stock,

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.580
we assume that the previous period's value gives us

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.855
some insight into the next period's value.

00:00:08.855 --> 00:00:12.330
It's also reasonable to assume that the past couple of

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.350
data points give us hints as to what the next value will be.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.130
This is the main principle behind Auto-regressive Models.

00:00:20.129 --> 00:00:24.604
An autoregressive model, also called an AR model,

00:00:24.605 --> 00:00:29.524
tries to fit a line that is a linear combination of previous values.

00:00:29.524 --> 00:00:33.074
The AR model includes an Intercept which represents

00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:36.905
some constant that is independent of the previous values.

00:00:36.905 --> 00:00:40.300
The AR model also includes an Error term,

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:45.064
which represents movements that cannot be predicted using the previous values.

00:00:45.064 --> 00:00:47.994
Let's see how we prepare the time-series data,

00:00:47.994 --> 00:00:50.774
to feed it into an Autoregressive model.

00:00:50.774 --> 00:00:53.810
As an example, our AR model will use

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.990
the previous two values to predict the current value.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.440
For example, if we have daily data for Monday, Tuesday,

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:06.920
and Wednesday, then we use Monday and Tuesday as the independent variables.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.620
We also define Wednesday as the dependent variable that the Model tries to predict.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.448
Then, when we move on to Thursday,

00:01:15.448 --> 00:01:19.155
we use the previous two days to predict Thursday's value.

00:01:19.155 --> 00:01:22.915
If data from a previous period has some predictive value,

00:01:22.915 --> 00:01:25.425
then this coefficient will be non-zero.

00:01:25.424 --> 00:01:29.689
The number of past values used in the model is known as the Lag.

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.659
We define an AR model by its Lag.

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.810
For example, a model that only uses yesterday's value and ignores the rest,

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.730
is an AR 1 Model.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.350
Whereas, a model that uses

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:46.419
the two previous days' values and ignores the rest is an AR 2 Model,

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.840
and a model that uses

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.870
the previous three days' values and ignores the rest is an AR 3 Model.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.750
We write Auto-regressive Models as ARP,

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.060
where p stands for the lag.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.640
We can choose different lag values to train

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.174
your model and see how they perform on test data.

00:02:05.174 --> 00:02:09.844
We can check if the coefficients are significantly different from zero.

00:02:09.844 --> 00:02:12.539
If some coefficients are likely zero,

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:17.150
then you can reduce the lag and focus the model on the more recent values.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.060
As with any regression model,

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.789
you can also check the adjusted R squared to get a sense of how

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:27.889
well the independent variables explain the movements of the dependent variables.

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:32.604
Note that an AR model is designed to represent a single time series.

00:02:32.604 --> 00:02:35.024
If you have several different time series,

00:02:35.025 --> 00:02:38.254
you could build a separate AR model for each.

00:02:38.254 --> 00:02:43.509
But what if the movement of one stock has some relation to the movement of another?

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:48.534
You may be seeing something similar with multivariate multiple regression.

00:02:48.534 --> 00:02:53.039
To account for interdependence among more than one time series,

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:56.840
we can use the multivariate version of autoregression.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.420
This is called a vector autoregressive model.

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:02.809
Note that having some familiarity with

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.289
the vector autoregressive model will help you

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:08.129
as you learn about pairs trading in a later lesson.
