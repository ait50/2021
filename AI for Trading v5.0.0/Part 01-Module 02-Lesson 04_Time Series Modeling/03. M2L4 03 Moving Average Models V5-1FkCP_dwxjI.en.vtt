00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
Another way to model time series is to think of

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.380
the stock return hovering around in moving average.

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:11.589
As an analogy, imagine that you're walking at night while holding a lantern,

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:13.994
a moth flies around the lantern,

00:00:13.994 --> 00:00:15.504
moving a bit randomly,

00:00:15.505 --> 00:00:18.910
but still following the general path of your lantern.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.350
In this analogy, the lantern represents the average position.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.285
The moth's smaller movements relative to the lantern are the residuals.

00:00:28.285 --> 00:00:31.429
The moth's movement relative to the ground is

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:36.479
a combination of the lantern's movement and the moth's relative movements.

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:38.628
In the moving average model,

00:00:38.628 --> 00:00:41.184
often called an MA model,

00:00:41.185 --> 00:00:43.325
we started with the average Mu.

00:00:43.325 --> 00:00:45.795
To get the value at time T,

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:50.660
we add a linear combination of residuals from the previous time periods.

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:52.879
In financial time series,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.645
the residuals represent the new unpredictable information

00:00:56.645 --> 00:00:59.900
that cannot be captured by the past data points.

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.299
The residuals are the difference between

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:06.109
the model's past predictions with the actual values that occurred.

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:12.439
Moving average models are defined as MAQ where Q is the lag.

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.954
To decide the best value for Q in an MAQ model,

00:01:16.954 --> 00:01:19.920
you can draw an autocorrelation plot.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.060
Correlation between two variables is a measure of

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.969
how much one variable moves when the other variable moves.

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:31.114
Correlation ranges between negative one and one.

00:01:31.114 --> 00:01:33.769
Autocorrelation is a measure of how much

00:01:33.769 --> 00:01:38.125
the current value moves in relation to one of its previous values.

00:01:38.125 --> 00:01:42.469
For example, let's say we noticed that the current stock return is usually

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:47.025
positive when its previous value is positive, and vice versa.

00:01:47.025 --> 00:01:53.420
Then, we can say that the stock has a positive autocorrelation with it's T minus 1 value.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.689
Note how an autocorrelation plot is different from performing a multiple regression.

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:04.579
Correlation measures the pairwise relationship between exactly two periods at a time.

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:07.340
Multiple regression measures how a set of

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.435
independent variables collectively influence the value of the dependent variable.

00:02:12.435 --> 00:02:14.900
When we view an autocorrelation plot,

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.289
we want to use the lag that contains highly positive or highly negative correlations.

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:23.639
When we reach some time periods with little correlation,

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:26.329
we can choose the lag to ignore those values

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.400
and any other time periods further back in time.
