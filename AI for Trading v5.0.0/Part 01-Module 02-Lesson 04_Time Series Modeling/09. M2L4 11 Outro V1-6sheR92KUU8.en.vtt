00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.554
In this lesson, we've seen statistical methods such as regression,

00:00:05.554 --> 00:00:08.189
autoregression, and moving averages.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.544
We've also seen Kalman filters,

00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:13.875
particle filters, and recurrent neural networks.

00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:17.440
Congratulations on making it through this lesson
