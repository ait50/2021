00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.375
Next, we'll discuss the particle filter,

00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:06.209
a type of genetic algorithm that is also

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:10.019
used for self-driving cars as well as time series.

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:16.050
By genetic algorithm, I mean that we apply natural selection to improve our estimates.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.480
This will become more clear in a bit.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.949
Let's start with a thought experiment.

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:24.544
Imagine that we can hire many little helpers,

00:00:24.545 --> 00:00:29.795
each with a certain view on where the stock returns are going based on market data.

00:00:29.795 --> 00:00:34.230
Each of these little helpers predict the stock return for the next day,

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:35.479
and on the following day,

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:37.544
you can see how correct they were.

00:00:37.545 --> 00:00:41.370
Each day, you pay more to the little helpers who are

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:45.169
correct and pay less to the incorrect helpers.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.245
Over time, only the accurate helpers remain to make predictions.

00:00:50.244 --> 00:00:52.753
So by the process of natural selection,

00:00:52.753 --> 00:00:54.619
we find the helpers who are most

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:58.354
accurate and average their predictions as your best estimate.

00:00:58.354 --> 00:01:02.239
Since this process looks like natural selection and evolution,

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.629
particle filters are considered a type of genetic algorithm.

00:01:05.629 --> 00:01:08.089
The little helpers are called particles.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.025
These particles are individual models whose parameters are set randomly.

00:01:13.025 --> 00:01:16.225
When most particles make very similar predictions,

00:01:16.224 --> 00:01:19.599
this also shows more confidence in the average prediction.

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:23.579
When there are significant changes in the data distribution at any point in time,

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:27.579
the particles may make predictions that are more different from each other.

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:31.754
In those cases, when the individual predictions are more spread out,

00:01:31.754 --> 00:01:34.239
we are less confident of the prediction.

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:37.549
Particle filters are pretty good at handling a variety of

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.429
data because they don't assume the data to be normally distributed.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.200
Particle filters also do not assume a linear relationship,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.269
so they can better fit non-linear data.
