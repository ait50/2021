00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
Autoregressive and moving average models tend to capture different relationships.

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.099
The nice thing is, you can get the best of both by adding them together.

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.644
An autoregressive moving average is defined with a p and q.

00:00:14.644 --> 00:00:17.730
The p is the lag for the autoregression,

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.699
the q is the lag for moving average.

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.669
A variation of the autoregressive moving average

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.185
is the autoregressive integrated moving average.

00:00:27.184 --> 00:00:31.434
This concept is used in a trading strategy called Pairs trading.

00:00:31.434 --> 00:00:34.729
First, let's build some intuition that will help us when

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:38.269
we study autoregressive integrated moving averages.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.795
Let's say we want to describe the position of a turtle.

00:00:41.795 --> 00:00:44.270
The turtle is walking at a regular pace.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.645
So, its position goes from zero,

00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:49.500
then one, then two, and so on.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.225
We noticed that the turtle is moving at a regular pace.

00:00:52.225 --> 00:00:54.015
So, we can describe its speed,

00:00:54.015 --> 00:00:55.685
or the distance over time,

00:00:55.685 --> 00:00:57.295
as a single number.

00:00:57.295 --> 00:01:01.405
For example, this turtle is moving at one meter per second.

00:01:01.405 --> 00:01:04.010
If we plot the turtle's position over time,

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.645
it is not constant.

00:01:05.644 --> 00:01:10.204
Its position over time will look like a line that slopes upward.

00:01:10.204 --> 00:01:13.890
However, if we plot the turtle's speed over time,

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.730
it is a constant one meter per second.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.689
The plot of speed over time is a horizontal line.

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.105
Now let's think about how the turtle's position is related to its speed.

00:01:25.105 --> 00:01:27.969
If we look at the turtle's position over time,

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:30.438
the slope of that line is its speed,

00:01:30.438 --> 00:01:31.954
or meters per second.

00:01:31.954 --> 00:01:33.549
Going the other way,

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.384
we look at the plot of the turtle's speed over time and take the cumulative sum.

00:01:38.385 --> 00:01:40.950
So, for instance, at each second,

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.079
we add one meter.

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.245
So, we get one meter,

00:01:44.245 --> 00:01:47.885
two meters, three meters, and so on.

00:01:47.885 --> 00:01:51.015
This is actually the area under the horizontal line,

00:01:51.015 --> 00:01:54.754
and is also the position of the turtle as time goes on.

00:01:54.754 --> 00:01:56.364
So, what did we learn here?

00:01:56.364 --> 00:02:00.184
In general, taking the difference between each period

00:02:00.185 --> 00:02:04.180
is called the time difference or item wise difference.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.979
If you take the time difference of your data,

00:02:06.978 --> 00:02:11.254
you may be able to describe your data more easily as a constant number.

00:02:11.254 --> 00:02:13.280
If you remember from calculus,

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.900
taking the derivative of a straight line gives the slope of that line.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.860
This slope gives us a way to describe the line with a constant.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.875
To go from speed back to position,

00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:26.944
we can take the integral.

00:02:26.944 --> 00:02:32.209
This is finding the area under the curve or taking the cumulative sum.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.320
Taking the integral lets us translate from the speed back to position.

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.609
We will now apply these concepts of time difference to learn

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.135
about the autoregressive integrated moving average.

00:02:44.134 --> 00:02:49.864
Recall that regression-based time series models require the data to be stationary.

00:02:49.865 --> 00:02:53.735
When data is not stationary, the mean, variants,

00:02:53.735 --> 00:02:56.150
or co-variants may change over time,

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.390
and it's hard to use the past to predict the future.

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.419
One way to get a stationary time series is by

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:05.739
taking the difference between points in the time series.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:11.475
The time difference may also be called the rate of change or the item wise difference.

00:03:11.474 --> 00:03:14.284
We call that the rate of change between periods,

00:03:14.284 --> 00:03:15.805
or the rate of return,

00:03:15.805 --> 00:03:22.349
can be calculated by taking the ratio of the current price divided by the previous price.

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.310
When you express your data in terms of logs,

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.409
this ratio becomes a difference between

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:31.085
your current log price and the previous log price.

00:03:31.085 --> 00:03:33.150
When working with financial data,

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.469
we usually find that asset price time series have

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:40.344
a property such that their time difference is stationary.

00:03:40.344 --> 00:03:44.090
In other words, we like working with returns and

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.094
not prices because the time series are more stable.

00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:54.814
In math terms, we say that the original price data is integrated of order one.

00:03:54.814 --> 00:04:01.395
We also say that the log returns of this data is integrated of order zero.

00:04:01.395 --> 00:04:04.080
So, when working the time series,

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.380
you can check if it is stationary using

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:10.479
a statistical test called the augmented Dickey Fuller test.

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:16.909
If the augmented Dickey Fuller test gives a p-value that is 0.05 or less,

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.380
then we can assume that the time series is stationary.

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:22.725
If the data is not stationary,

00:04:22.725 --> 00:04:25.939
we can take the time difference then run

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:30.310
the augmented Dickey-Fuller test to see if the time difference is stationary.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.030
If it is stationary,

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:36.834
then we can say that this time difference is integrated of order zero.

00:04:36.834 --> 00:04:42.854
We can also say that the original time series is integrated of order one.

00:04:42.855 --> 00:04:46.175
You may need to take the time difference multiple times.

00:04:46.175 --> 00:04:49.500
Then, once you find a time difference that is stationary,

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.504
you refer to the original data as integrated of

00:04:52.504 --> 00:04:57.610
order d where d is the number of times that you had to take the time difference.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.040
Also, once we have a stationary time series,

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.280
we can model it with an autoregressive moving average.

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:07.069
Note that being familiar with the integrated order

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:10.129
one and integrated ordered zero time series

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:14.469
will help you as you learn about co-integration and pairs trading.
