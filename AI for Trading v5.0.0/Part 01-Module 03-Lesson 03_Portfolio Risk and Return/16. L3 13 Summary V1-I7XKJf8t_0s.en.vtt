00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
In this lesson, we learned how to calculate

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.080
the expected return and variance of a portfolio risky assets.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.565
We study the properties of all possible portfolios of risky assets,

00:00:11.564 --> 00:00:14.809
and what happens when a risk-free asset is added.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.945
What you learn in this lesson is essential foundational knowledge.

00:00:18.945 --> 00:00:20.250
Once you understand it,

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.079
you'll be ready to learn how to obtain

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.669
the best possible risk return balance from your portfolio,

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.679
which is what we'll study next.
