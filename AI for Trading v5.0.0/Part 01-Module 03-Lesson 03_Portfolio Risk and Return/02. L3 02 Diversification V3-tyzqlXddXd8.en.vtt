00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.349
Since you've studied the stocks in your universe now for a while,

00:00:04.349 --> 00:00:07.919
you might already know which stock has been performing the best.

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.679
Let's call it New Digital Corporation.

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.064
At this point, you may want to put all your money in New Digital stock.

00:00:15.064 --> 00:00:20.460
But let's say you do this and New Digital stock keeps increasing in value for a while,

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.675
but suddenly drops to half the price you purchased that.

00:00:23.675 --> 00:00:26.580
Since you used all your money to buy the stock,

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:28.484
you just lost half your money.

00:00:28.484 --> 00:00:31.399
Ouch! What if instead you put

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.600
half your money in New Digital and half your money in Big Pharma Company?

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.300
Intuitively, this seems like it could smooth out the dips and value of your investment,

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:46.209
because New Digital could start doing well when it launches a new tech product,

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.445
while Big Pharma recovers from a failed drug trial.

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:53.204
Big pharma might start doing well when it's research arm,

00:00:53.204 --> 00:00:56.369
deliver several new promising candidate drugs,

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:59.905
while New Digital struggles during a change in management.

00:00:59.905 --> 00:01:06.579
What we've done here is reduced our portfolio risk by diversifying our portfolio.

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:11.234
But why not keep spreading our money into more and more stocks?

00:01:11.234 --> 00:01:15.049
Can we reduce our portfolio risk indefinitely?

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.965
If all the sources of risk are independent,

00:01:17.965 --> 00:01:19.810
we could in theory,

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.704
reduce risk to zero by spreading our money between more and more stocks.

00:01:24.704 --> 00:01:27.560
This would be the case if each company is only

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.740
subject to its own independent sources of risk,

00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:33.875
and there are no risks common to all companies.

00:01:33.875 --> 00:01:40.040
Risks specific to individual companies is called idiosyncratic risk or specific risk.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.550
However, in the real world,

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:45.829
all companies are subject to common sources of risk that

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.920
affect the entire economy such as the risks of inflation,

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.659
recession, or change in interest rates or GDP.

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:00.935
Risk attributable to market-wide sources is called market risk or systematic risk.

00:02:00.935 --> 00:02:04.340
Let's see if we can quantify this risk and

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.200
find some guidelines for how to allocate our money.
