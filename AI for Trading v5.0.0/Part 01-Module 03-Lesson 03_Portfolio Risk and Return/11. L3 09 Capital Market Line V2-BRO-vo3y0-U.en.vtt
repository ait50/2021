00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.595
In the last video,

00:00:01.595 --> 00:00:03.780
you learned about the efficient frontier.

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:07.169
You know that any point on the efficient frontier represents

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:10.859
the portfolio that gives you the best risk return trade-off,

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:14.129
and that these portfolios are known as market portfolios.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.535
But is that it? Is there a way to do better than the efficient frontier?

00:00:18.535 --> 00:00:22.560
In this video, we will be adding a risk-free asset into

00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:27.304
our portfolio and we're going to introduce something called the capital market line.

00:00:27.304 --> 00:00:30.500
A risk-free asset is an investment instrument that

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.789
entails absolutely no risk or uncertainty.

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:36.950
In theory, if you invest in such an instrument,

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.170
you receive a guaranteed rate of return called the risk-free rate and

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.870
reality entirely risk-free assets don't

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:48.905
exist since all investments carry a certain level of risk.

00:00:48.905 --> 00:00:52.460
However, in practice people normally refer to the rate of

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.884
return on a three month treasury bill as the risk-free rate.

00:00:56.884 --> 00:01:00.994
Now let's add this risk-free asset into the picture.

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:04.909
Let's imagine we construct a new portfolio with any of

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.295
the market portfolios that you prefer and the risk-free asset.

00:01:09.295 --> 00:01:12.290
Which market portfolio would you choose?

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.480
Note that this new portfolio is

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.335
a weighted sum of the risk-free asset and the market portfolio.

00:01:18.334 --> 00:01:24.114
For example, if you choose the green portfolio as your market portfolio and the red.

00:01:24.114 --> 00:01:25.974
as your risk-free asset,

00:01:25.974 --> 00:01:28.280
the line between them represents

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.980
the potential portfolios that you can construct with the two assets.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.755
Now, which market portfolio would you choose

00:01:36.754 --> 00:01:40.924
so as to achieve the best return for a given level of risk?

00:01:40.924 --> 00:01:44.659
Well, you should be looking at the efficient frontier,

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.170
the top edge of the set of possible portfolios.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.090
It turns out that you should choose the market portfolio that allows you to draw

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.920
a straight line starting from

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.335
the risk-free asset that just touches the top of the efficient frontier.

00:01:59.334 --> 00:02:03.494
To see why this is the best market portfolio for the job,

00:02:03.495 --> 00:02:05.680
let's take a look at lines A, B,

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.860
and C. Note that line A connects

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.190
the red dot which represents the risk-free asset with the green dot,

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:17.039
which represents the tangent market portfolio on the efficient frontier.

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:22.984
Line A lies above the efficient frontier and intersects the tangent portfolio.

00:02:22.985 --> 00:02:27.560
All the portfolios represented by line A have higher returns

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.020
than the ones on the efficient frontier given the same risk level.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.430
This is not the case for lines B and

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.210
C. Portfolios on this tangent line are the best achievable.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.945
They even beat the efficient frontier which consists of purely risky assets.

00:02:43.944 --> 00:02:47.549
This line is called the capital market line.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.390
Now what is the expected return of

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:54.819
the portfolio consisting of the risky portfolio and the risk-free asset?

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.039
The formula for this quantity is also the formula for

00:02:58.039 --> 00:03:01.280
the capital market line because each point on this line

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.280
gives the return as a function of risk of

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.824
a possible combination of the risky portfolio and the risk-free asset.

00:03:08.824 --> 00:03:13.019
So let's examine the graph to determine the equation.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.814
You have two points 0,

00:03:15.814 --> 00:03:19.840
rf which is the risk-free portfolio and sigma m,

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.129
rm which is the market portfolio.

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:28.734
The slope of a line simply equals rm minus rf divided by sigma m.

00:03:28.735 --> 00:03:32.810
This quantity the difference between the market return and

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.115
the risk-free rate is called the market risk premium.

00:03:37.115 --> 00:03:41.300
The portfolio return is then just the risk-free rate of return as

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.160
a baseline plus the slope times the portfolio volatility.

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:50.060
The portfolio volatility will depend on what weights you choose to

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.335
put on the risk-free asset and the market portfolio, i.e.

00:03:54.335 --> 00:03:57.995
where you choose to sit along the capital market line.

00:03:57.995 --> 00:04:00.890
The slope of the capital market line,

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:04.009
which is of course the same for all points on

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:09.149
the line is a special quantity known as the Sharpe Ratio of the market.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.185
We're going to discuss that more in a future lesson.

00:04:12.185 --> 00:04:15.560
In fact, if you can borrow at the risk-free rate,

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.850
you can achieve points on

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.600
the capital market line to the right of the tangent market portfolio.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.760
This amounts to setting a negative weight on the risk-free asset.

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.014
That is to say, shorting it.

00:04:27.014 --> 00:04:30.829
This is why professional investors care almost only about

00:04:30.829 --> 00:04:36.870
the Sharpe ratio because they can manufacture any level of risk or return with leverage.
