00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.620
Let's see how this works in more detail,

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.890
by constructing a portfolio that contains

00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:08.353
two stocks and then calculating its mean and variance.

00:00:08.353 --> 00:00:15.375
Let's put a fraction xA of our portfolio in stock A and the rest xB in stock B.

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:19.050
We call xA and xB the weights on assets A and B in

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.495
our portfolio and we know these weights xA and xB sum to one.

00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:28.125
To calculate the mean and variance of our portfolio,

00:00:28.125 --> 00:00:32.905
we will again need to think of future log returns as random variables,

00:00:32.905 --> 00:00:38.530
that is as quantities that can take a variety of values with different probabilities.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.285
You can think of returns,

00:00:40.284 --> 00:00:43.459
at a future time as being indexed by i,

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.725
where i is a possible scenario or alternate timeline of the future.

00:00:48.725 --> 00:00:51.100
R the log return,

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.005
takes different values for different scenarios

00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:58.155
and different scenarios have different probabilities of occurring.

00:00:58.155 --> 00:01:00.865
The expected value of R,

00:01:00.865 --> 00:01:05.234
which we referred to before as the mean or expected log return,

00:01:05.234 --> 00:01:08.189
is given by this formula.

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.739
The total return of the portfolio in each scenario is

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:17.204
just the weighted sum of the returns of each individual asset.

00:01:17.204 --> 00:01:20.840
The expected value of the portfolio return,

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.335
equals the weighted sum of the individual stock's expected returns.

00:01:25.334 --> 00:01:30.964
To see this, we take the expected value of the portfolio returns.

00:01:30.965 --> 00:01:35.260
The summation symbol distributes across the sum,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.205
then we can pull out the weights because they are independent of scenario.

00:01:40.204 --> 00:01:46.069
Finally, we see that each term is the expected value of the individual asset.
