00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
Congratulations, on getting through the first five nodes.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.540
You're now over a third of the way through this lesson.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.800
Because some of the topics in this lesson are so math heavy,

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.365
we wanted to create content that contain the actual formulas.

00:00:13.365 --> 00:00:17.884
Beta testers suggested that content delivered as text is super-helpful.

00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:19.830
Be sure to let us know what you think.

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:23.789
Udacity is all about creating an environment that encourages students,

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.989
but we also want to learn from you.

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:29.239
We want your feedback to be included in the process.

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:32.655
Your feedback helps us to iterate and create better lessons.

00:00:32.655 --> 00:00:35.120
So, if we do something that you like, let us know,

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:36.824
and if you think we could do something better,

00:00:36.825 --> 00:00:38.380
let us know that too.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.880
Good luck with the rest of the lesson.
