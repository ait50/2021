00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.569
Okay. So far you've learned about the importance of

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:07.464
diversification and how to calculate portfolio mean and variance.

00:00:07.464 --> 00:00:12.958
You may wonder, what are the best ways to assign to each stock in your portfolio.

00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:15.779
Before we dive into portfolio optimization,

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:18.899
let's take a look at the set of all possible portfolios.

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:22.649
This will lead us to an important concept, the efficient frontier.

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:25.934
Before we start, let's quickly recap.

00:00:25.934 --> 00:00:28.559
The expected return of a portfolio,

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:32.539
equals the weighted sum of each stock's expected returns.

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:34.789
The variance of a portfolio,

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:40.479
equals the sum of the pairwise covariances weighted by the products of the weights.

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:42.564
Okay. I think we're ready to go.

00:00:42.564 --> 00:00:46.344
Let's first take a look at a simple example with five stocks.

00:00:46.344 --> 00:00:48.060
Stocks A, B, C,

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.880
D and E with given annual mean returns and covariances.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.540
One day your manager gives you $10,000 and tells

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.125
you to invest in these five stocks whichever way you want.

00:01:00.125 --> 00:01:03.229
But taking only long not short positions.

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.170
What would you do with this money?

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.405
Of course, you would want to impress your manager and create

00:01:08.405 --> 00:01:11.805
a portfolio with the highest returns and the lowest risk.

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:13.360
Is this possible?

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:17.569
How would you do it? You've given the task some thought and

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:22.239
decided to just create a few portfolios with randomly assigned weights.

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:24.094
For the first portfolio,

00:01:24.094 --> 00:01:28.674
you give each stock an equal weight of 20% of the total capital.

00:01:28.674 --> 00:01:35.159
The portfolio return equals 4% and the standard deviation equals 3%.

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.724
Is this good enough?

00:01:37.724 --> 00:01:39.074
You are not sure.

00:01:39.075 --> 00:01:43.700
So, you just keep testing different combinations by assigning a little more weight to

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.159
one stock and a little less to another and

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.459
then rechecking the portfolio's return and risk.

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:51.750
The more simulations you do,

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.974
the more interesting the problem gets.

00:01:53.974 --> 00:01:59.250
For example, both scenario one and two have the same risk,

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.540
but scenario one has higher expected return.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.130
In this case, you will definitely prefer scenario one.

00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:10.443
Also, scenario four has the highest expected return

00:02:10.443 --> 00:02:15.229
of 0.07 but it also has the highest risk of 0.04.

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:20.215
Scenario four is less attractive because it is a riskier portfolio.

00:02:20.215 --> 00:02:22.344
This is interesting; isn't it?

00:02:22.344 --> 00:02:25.609
Let's try to run thousands more scenarios and plot the

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.490
expected portfolio return against portfolio volatility.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.735
Okay. Here is a plot representing 25,000 simulated portfolios.

00:02:34.735 --> 00:02:39.080
Each dot represents a possible risk return combination

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.230
that can be generated by the basket of stocks.

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:47.004
The x axis is the volatility and the y-axis is the return.

00:02:47.004 --> 00:02:52.245
What have you noticed? Let's take a look at a quick example.

00:02:52.245 --> 00:02:57.349
Let's take a look at these two portfolios represented by the red and yellow dots.

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:02.090
Notice that both portfolios have the same risk of 0.035 but

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.319
the red portfolio has significantly higher expected return of 0.06.

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.069
Furthemore, the red dot outperforms

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.659
all the portfolios with risk of 0.035 but there's more.

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.240
Have you noticed that all the dots that lie on

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.439
the upper boundary outperform the dots below it?

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:23.189
This is the efficient frontier.

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:28.590
The efficient frontier is the upper boundary of the set of possible portfolios.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.564
Portfolios on this boundary have the maximum achievable return for a given level of risk.

00:03:34.564 --> 00:03:38.639
Any portfolios above the frontier are unachievable.

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.869
It's not possible to find a combination of stocks that

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.810
produces a higher level of return at that same level of risk.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.159
On the flip side, portfolios below the frontier

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:52.384
are certainly achievable but one might wonder why

00:03:52.384 --> 00:03:56.149
a rational investor would prefer a lower rate of return when she

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.439
could achieve a higher return while taking on the same level of risk.

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:03.379
The portfolio that achieves the lowest level of

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:06.669
risk is called the minimum variance portfolio,

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:12.069
and the portfolios on the efficient frontier are known as market portfolios.
