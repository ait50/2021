00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.225
Welcome back. So, far in this module,

00:00:03.225 --> 00:00:05.790
you've learned about Indices and ETFs,

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.500
their application in the real world and how they work on a transactional level.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.339
Now, we're going to talk about the baskets of stocks that underlie

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:16.670
these instruments and you will learn how to

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.000
distribute money across the stocks in the basket.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.655
First, we'll discuss the risk and return properties of a collection of stocks.

00:00:25.655 --> 00:00:28.820
So, let's say, you've researched

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.600
your trading signals and finally come up with a list of stocks to buy.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.405
You know how much money you have to spend.

00:00:35.405 --> 00:00:40.125
You're ready to buy the stocks needed to construct a portfolio for an ETF.

00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:44.420
But, how much money should you invest in each stock?

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.265
Well, putting more money in stocks that you expect to have the highest returns,

00:00:50.265 --> 00:00:54.810
seems naturally more likely to give you higher returns.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.030
But what if the prices of these stocks undergo the most fluctuations.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.984
That is they entail the greatest risk.

00:01:01.984 --> 00:01:04.534
You might have great returns for a while,

00:01:04.534 --> 00:01:06.500
but then, you could lose it all.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.644
There must be a balance here.

00:01:08.644 --> 00:01:12.819
How do you distribute money to not only maximize returns,

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:14.844
but also minimize risk.

00:01:14.844 --> 00:01:18.340
That's a question that's been challenging great financial minds for

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.439
years and you're about to embark on a quest in search of the solution.
