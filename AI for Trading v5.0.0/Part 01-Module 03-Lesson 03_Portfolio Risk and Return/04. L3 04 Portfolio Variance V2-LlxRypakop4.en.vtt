00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.025
Now, let's calculate a metric of the total risk inherent to the portfolio.

00:00:05.025 --> 00:00:09.570
We'll measure risk with volatility or more specifically with the variance,

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.355
the square of the volatility.

00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:15.560
Let's review the formula for the variance of one asset.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.679
This is a slightly different formula for variance than we've seen before,

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:21.134
but it's similar in spirit.

00:00:21.135 --> 00:00:23.940
Instead of just summing the squared difference between

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.000
each observation and the mean and dividing by n,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.600
we multiply the squared difference by

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.625
the probability of that value occurring and sum those.

00:00:34.625 --> 00:00:37.520
The formula will be the same as dividing by n,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.460
if the probability of each scenario occurring is the same.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.695
So, now let's calculate the variance of the portfolio.

00:00:45.695 --> 00:00:48.149
This takes just a few simple steps,

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.685
but for now we will skip ahead to the answer.

00:00:50.685 --> 00:00:54.780
You'll find the full derivation given as text on this page.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.109
We find that the portfolio variance equals the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.670
squared of weights times each asset's variance,

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.695
plus a term that includes the covariance of the assets multiplied by each weight.

00:01:07.694 --> 00:01:10.819
Remember that the covariance is a measure of

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:13.869
the joint variability of two random variables.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.175
When stock A is above its average,

00:01:16.174 --> 00:01:18.864
if stock B is also above its average,

00:01:18.864 --> 00:01:21.334
they are varying together or covarying,

00:01:21.334 --> 00:01:23.739
so they have a positive covariance.

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:27.045
This covariance term turns out to be very important.

00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:30.905
It basically underlies the benefit of diversification.

00:01:30.905 --> 00:01:34.775
Remember that the covariance is just the correlation

00:01:34.775 --> 00:01:38.925
between the two variables times each of their standard deviations.

00:01:38.924 --> 00:01:43.870
We know that the correlation coefficient takes values between minus one and one,

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.090
where minus one means the variables are perfectly anti-correlated,

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.454
and one means that they are perfectly correlated.

00:01:51.453 --> 00:01:57.614
Both correlation and covariance are measures of how much two variables vary together.

00:01:57.614 --> 00:02:03.364
With this knowledge, we can rewrite the portfolio variance in terms of the correlation.

00:02:03.364 --> 00:02:05.599
Let's see what happens to the variance of

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:11.104
our two-asset portfolio when the correlation between stock A and stock B is one.

00:02:11.104 --> 00:02:16.389
In that case, the expression to the right of the equal sign is a perfect square,

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:18.769
and the portfolio standard deviation is

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.390
just a weighted average of the standard deviations of the individual stocks.

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:25.339
In all other cases,

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.770
the correlation coefficient is less than one.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.560
So the portfolio standard deviation is less than

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.229
the weighted average of the individual standard deviations.

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:38.859
How about when the correlation between stock A and B is minus one?

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.140
In that case, the portfolio variance reduces to

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:46.114
the weighted difference between the two standard deviations squared

00:02:46.115 --> 00:02:49.100
and the portfolio standard deviation becomes

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.875
the absolute weighted difference between the individual standard deviations.

00:02:53.875 --> 00:02:56.629
In the case when the correlation is minus one,

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:01.014
we can get a perfectly hedged portfolio by solving this equation.

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:06.064
If we plug in the relation that the weights x_A and x_B sum to one,

00:03:06.064 --> 00:03:11.629
we get that x_A equals Sigma B divided by Sigma A plus Sigma B.

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.719
These weights drive the portfolio variance to zero.

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:20.925
However, in reality, since every asset is affected by systematic risk,

00:03:20.925 --> 00:03:24.800
the correlation between two assets will never reach minus one.
