The word "data" is defined as distinct pieces of information.

00:00:05.495 --> 00:00:08.724
You may think of data as simply numbers on a spreadsheet,

00:00:08.724 --> 00:00:11.004
but data can come in many forms.

00:00:11.005 --> 00:00:17.455
From text to video to spreadsheets and databases to images to audio,

00:00:17.454 --> 00:00:20.244
and I'm sure I'm forgetting many other forms.

00:00:20.245 --> 00:00:23.795
Utilizing data is the new way of the world.

00:00:23.795 --> 00:00:29.425
Data is used to understand and improve nearly every facet of our lives.

00:00:29.425 --> 00:00:32.560
From early disease detection to social networks

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.020
that allow us to connect and communicate with people around the world.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.290
No matter what field you're in,

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:41.094
from insurance and banking, to medicine,

00:00:41.094 --> 00:00:43.494
to education, to agriculture,,

00:00:43.494 --> 00:00:46.809
to automotive, to manufacturing, and so on.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.800
You can utilize data to make better decisions and accomplish your goals.

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:56.259
We will be getting you started on the right foot to using your data in this course.
