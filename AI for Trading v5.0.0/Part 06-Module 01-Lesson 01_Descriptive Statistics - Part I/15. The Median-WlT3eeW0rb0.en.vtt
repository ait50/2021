00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
A more appropriate measure in this case, might be the median.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.039
The median is a value that divides our data set such that

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:12.904
50% of the values are larger while the remaining 50% are smaller.

00:00:12.904 --> 00:00:14.384
For our data set,

00:00:14.384 --> 00:00:16.225
we have a median of eight.

00:00:16.225 --> 00:00:20.685
This is a much better response than the 12 and a half dogs reported by the mean.

00:00:20.684 --> 00:00:23.744
Not only does eight sit in the middle of our data set,

00:00:23.745 --> 00:00:26.445
but it doesn't split any of our dogs in half.

00:00:26.445 --> 00:00:28.914
As a note on calculating the median,

00:00:28.914 --> 00:00:33.089
the actual calculation of the median depends on whether we're working with

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.680
a data set with an even number of values or an odd number of values.

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:41.314
Let's consider a couple of examples to illustrate this point.

00:00:41.314 --> 00:00:46.195
The first thing we should do is order the values from smallest to largest.

00:00:46.195 --> 00:00:47.880
In this top case,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.943
we are working with seven values.

00:00:49.942 --> 00:00:53.004
In notation we might say, n equals seven.

00:00:53.005 --> 00:00:55.344
Because this is an odd number,

00:00:55.344 --> 00:00:59.156
we have the median as the exact middle value,

00:00:59.156 --> 00:01:01.489
in this case, the number three.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.175
In a second case,

00:01:03.174 --> 00:01:06.049
let's consider n to be an even value.

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.250
Let's find the median of the following list.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.549
Again, we should first put these values in order.

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:16.090
Because there isn't an exact center value, we will,

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.490
in this case,take the mean of the two values in the center as our median.

00:01:21.489 --> 00:01:24.774
Notice, this does not even need to be a number in our data set.

00:01:24.775 --> 00:01:27.850
Because n is equal to eight for this example,

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:29.769
the mean of the fourth and

00:01:29.769 --> 00:01:34.359
the fifth values will provide to us the median for this data set.

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:36.924
Moving four values from each of the sides,

00:01:36.924 --> 00:01:43.849
makes it so that we take the mean of three and five to obtain the median of four.
