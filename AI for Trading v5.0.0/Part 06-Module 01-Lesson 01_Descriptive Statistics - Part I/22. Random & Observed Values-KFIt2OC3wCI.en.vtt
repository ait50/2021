00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.890
Connecting this full circle,

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:07.169
these capital letters X and Y relate to a random variable.

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:09.304
This is an abstract idea.

00:00:09.304 --> 00:00:12.064
How much time an individual spends on our website,

00:00:12.064 --> 00:00:14.394
can take on lots of different values.

00:00:14.394 --> 00:00:18.070
So, this capital letter X is not a number,

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.635
it's an entire set of possible values.

00:00:21.635 --> 00:00:27.950
We can think of capital X as a placeholder for any of these possible values.

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.434
When we look at an individual outcome of our random variable,

00:00:31.434 --> 00:00:34.359
we signify this with a lower case letter.

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:36.894
Often the lower case letter has a subscript,

00:00:36.895 --> 00:00:41.710
that helps us attach notation to each specific value in our dataset.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.325
For this dataset, we would say the amount of time

00:00:45.325 --> 00:00:49.325
an individual spends on our site is provided by an amount,

00:00:49.325 --> 00:00:52.095
which we would notate with a capital X.

00:00:52.094 --> 00:00:55.149
The first visitor spends five minutes on the site,

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.475
which we would notate with x1.

00:00:57.475 --> 00:01:00.399
Notice, this is a lowercase x.

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.159
The second visitor spends 10 minutes on the site,

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:05.849
which we wouldn't notate as x2.

00:01:05.849 --> 00:01:10.359
Again, since this is an observed value this is a lowercase x.

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:15.234
The labeling could continue until we reach the final visitor in our dataset,

00:01:15.234 --> 00:01:17.545
who we'd called the nth visitor.

00:01:17.545 --> 00:01:19.620
We would label this value as xn.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.035
Again, this is a lowercase value.

00:01:23.034 --> 00:01:27.959
Notation is an essential tool for us to communicate mathematical ideas.

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:30.009
We have now discussed the idea that

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.980
capital letters are used as notation for random variables.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.159
When we observe a particular value of the random variable we use a lowercase letter,

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.200
with a subscript that signifies

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.439
the specific value of the random variable we are considering.

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.144
Notation can be tricky.

00:01:47.144 --> 00:01:50.689
Before we dive deeper, check your understanding.

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:53.090
There are quizzes available in the next module

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.000
to assure you've mastered the concepts we've introduced.
