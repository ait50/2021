00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.910
In this video, we'll be taking a look at

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.224
the different data types that exists in the world around us.

00:00:06.224 --> 00:00:07.830
When sitting at coffee shops,

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.914
I enjoy watching the dogs pass.

00:00:09.914 --> 00:00:12.814
I often wonder, how many crossed my path?

00:00:12.814 --> 00:00:16.530
I wonder if more pass on weekdays or weekends.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.045
Maybe the number differs from Mondays to Tuesdays.

00:00:20.045 --> 00:00:23.170
I also pay attention to the breeds of the dogs.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.950
I wonder if more collies stopped by on Monday than on Wednesday.

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.054
I wonder what's the most common breed.

00:00:29.054 --> 00:00:32.625
Is that breed the most common at all coffee shops?

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:35.070
If I walked across the street to my favorite breed,

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.259
would the most common breed change?

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:41.714
This introduces two main data types: quantitative data,

00:00:41.715 --> 00:00:43.200
like the number of dogs,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.870
and categorical data, like the breed.

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:47.759
Quantitative data takes on

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:52.034
numeric values that allow us to perform mathematical operations.

00:00:52.034 --> 00:00:53.754
In the previous example,

00:00:53.755 --> 00:00:56.050
we saw this with the number of dogs.

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:58.094
If I see five dogs on Monday,

00:00:58.094 --> 00:01:00.009
and six dogs on Tuesday,

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:03.479
I've seen a total of 11 dogs so far this week.

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:09.989
Alternatively, categorical data frequently are used to label a group or set of items.

00:01:09.989 --> 00:01:12.059
We saw this with the breeds of the dogs.
