00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.769
But now, if we want to sum all the values in our original example,

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:08.044
we no longer need to write out all of the xs.

00:00:08.044 --> 00:00:15.710
Instead, we can write our summation starting at i=1 and ending at the fifth value.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:22.175
This is way better when wanting to extend to 10 or 20 or even 100 values.

00:00:22.175 --> 00:00:25.589
We no longer need to write out all of those xs.

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:29.515
However, we can be even more efficient than this.

00:00:29.515 --> 00:00:32.024
Each time our data set changes,

00:00:32.024 --> 00:00:37.192
I have to change this number at the top to indicate how many values I'm summing.

00:00:37.192 --> 00:00:40.024
If we really just want to sum all of our values,

00:00:40.024 --> 00:00:47.164
we can replace this top value with n. Now our notation will work for any data set.

00:00:47.164 --> 00:00:50.189
So far, we have a way to sum all of

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:53.669
our values regardless of how many are in our data set.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.825
In order to finish this calculation of the mean,

00:00:56.825 --> 00:01:01.215
we need to divide our sum by how many values are in our data set.

00:01:01.215 --> 00:01:07.465
But this is just n. You would commonly see the mean of the data set notated like this,

00:01:07.465 --> 00:01:10.305
which we pronounce as x-bar,

00:01:10.305 --> 00:01:14.955
and it is calculated with this notation which says you sum

00:01:14.954 --> 00:01:17.219
all of the values in the data set and then

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:20.150
divide by the number of values in the data set.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.805
Learning notation can be tough.

00:01:22.805 --> 00:01:25.720
Don't be afraid to watch this video more than once.

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:28.299
Before we move on to the next sections,

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:30.909
there are quizzes available in the next module to

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.000
assure you've mastered the concepts we've introduced here.
