00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.615
A quick overview leading up to your first project.

00:00:03.615 --> 00:00:06.480
We will start with an overview of data types and

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.605
the most common statistics used when analyzing data.

00:00:09.605 --> 00:00:13.169
We'll discuss measures of center and spread.

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:17.910
The most common shapes that data takes on and how to handle outliers.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.100
You will take this farther by using spreadsheets to handle these calculations for you.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.390
You'll learn how to build visuals to better convey your message as well as how to use

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.310
these features of spreadsheets to take your data game to a whole new level.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.740
All of this is aimed to help you succeed on

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.140
the very first project and for analyzing your own data.
