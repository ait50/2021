00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.069
As a first example,

00:00:02.069 --> 00:00:06.449
let's apply this new idea of notation to something you've used before.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.835
Spreadsheets. Spreadsheets are a common way we hold data in the real world.

00:00:11.835 --> 00:00:15.825
In our spreadsheet, we have rows and columns.

00:00:15.824 --> 00:00:19.774
To better understand how we use spreadsheets to hold data,

00:00:19.774 --> 00:00:21.779
let's work through an example.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.945
Before even collecting data,

00:00:23.945 --> 00:00:27.570
we usually start with a question or many questions.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.820
Consider I run a small blog about my

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.585
best and worst adventures with the dogs at the coffee shop.

00:00:33.585 --> 00:00:37.399
Which also sells trinkets related to those adventures.

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.049
Everything from fetch toys to leashes,

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:43.140
to doggie bags, and everything in between.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.265
Questions I might have are: How many people visit my site?

00:00:47.265 --> 00:00:50.505
Or how much time do visitors spend on my site?

00:00:50.505 --> 00:00:52.285
Are there differences in traffic,

00:00:52.284 --> 00:00:54.280
depending on the day of the week?

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.975
How many visitors purchase an item through the blog?

00:00:57.975 --> 00:01:00.645
In order to answer these questions,

00:01:00.645 --> 00:01:03.450
say we keep track of the date of the visit,

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.484
the day of the week of the visit,

00:01:05.484 --> 00:01:07.275
the amount of time spent on the site,

00:01:07.275 --> 00:01:10.260
and whether or not an individual buys an item.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.344
We can think of each of these as a column.

00:01:13.344 --> 00:01:17.795
A column in our dataset is associated with a random variable.

00:01:17.795 --> 00:01:22.180
Explaining what a random variable is in English is complicated.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.695
But in notation, it's simple.

00:01:24.694 --> 00:01:31.829
In English, a random variable is a placeholder for the possible values of some process.

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.614
In notation, it's X.

00:01:34.614 --> 00:01:37.574
For our website, the date of the visit,

00:01:37.575 --> 00:01:39.730
the day of the week of the visit,

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.715
the amount of time spent on the site,

00:01:41.715 --> 00:01:46.825
and whether or not an individual buys an item are all variables.

00:01:46.825 --> 00:01:50.760
Let's say we have a visitor on Thursday, June 15.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.130
The visitor stays on our site for five minutes and doesn't buy an item.

00:01:56.129 --> 00:01:57.375
Then a second visitor,

00:01:57.375 --> 00:02:03.659
visits the site on the exact same day for 10 minutes and they do buy an item.

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.400
Notice how each of these individuals has been added to our spreadsheet.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.485
We might have many more visitors,

00:02:10.485 --> 00:02:13.565
and we could update our spreadsheet accordingly.

00:02:13.564 --> 00:02:16.219
When using spreadsheets, we frequently

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:20.104
analyze a full column to answer our questions of interest.

00:02:20.104 --> 00:02:25.709
For example, to answer the question of how much time do visitors spend on our site?

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.099
We need to look at this column.

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.569
To answer the question of,

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.364
Are there differences in traffic,

00:02:31.365 --> 00:02:33.100
depending on the day of the week?

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.125
We need to look at this column.

00:02:35.125 --> 00:02:37.074
And to answer the question of,

00:02:37.074 --> 00:02:39.634
How many purchases occur through our blog?

00:02:39.634 --> 00:02:41.685
We need to look at this column.

00:02:41.685 --> 00:02:49.395
Mathematically, we usually consider a random variable or column using a capital letter.

00:02:49.395 --> 00:02:52.115
Commonly, we use the capital letter X,

00:02:52.115 --> 00:02:54.950
but we can just as easily use Y,

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:58.134
Z or any other capital letter.

00:02:58.134 --> 00:03:01.414
We might say, consider the random variable X,

00:03:01.414 --> 00:03:05.655
which signifies the amount of time an individual spends on our website.

00:03:05.655 --> 00:03:09.680
Therefore, X relates to this entire column.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.990
Consider we also have a random variable Y,

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.379
which signifies whether or not an individual purchases an item from the website,

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.250
so Y relates to this entire column.
