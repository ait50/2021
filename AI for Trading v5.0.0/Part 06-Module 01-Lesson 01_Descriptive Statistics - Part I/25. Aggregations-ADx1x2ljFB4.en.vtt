00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.254
There are common ways to notate most aggregations.

00:00:04.254 --> 00:00:09.234
An aggregation is just a way to turn multiple numbers into fewer numbers,

00:00:09.234 --> 00:00:11.664
usually just one number.

00:00:11.664 --> 00:00:16.105
Common aggregations include the measures of center we introduced earlier,

00:00:16.105 --> 00:00:19.429
like the mean, the median, and the mode.

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:22.300
Each of these takes many numbers and provides

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.070
a single value to give information about the data set.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.730
In this example, we want to aggregate all the values into a single sum.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.054
In other words, add them up.

00:00:34.054 --> 00:00:38.429
The Greek alphabet is a popular place to pull notation.

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:44.144
Similar to English, there are both lower and upper case letters in the Greek alphabet.

00:00:44.145 --> 00:00:46.609
For summing many values together,

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:49.329
we use a Greek symbol known as Sigma.

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.304
Specifically, we use the uppercase Sigma.

00:00:52.304 --> 00:00:55.966
We generally use the symbol in the following way:

00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:59.515
you will notice that instead of writing multiple x values,

00:00:59.515 --> 00:01:01.369
each with a different subscript,

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:05.700
we write a single x with a subscript of i.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.525
Here, the I is a placeholder that tells us which x values we'll be summing up.

00:01:12.525 --> 00:01:14.185
In our first case,

00:01:14.185 --> 00:01:16.510
summing only the first two values,

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.070
we want this i to be the value of either one or two.

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:22.569
Now you might be asking,

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:27.489
how does this notation show which values we're summing together.

00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:29.854
This is a great question.

00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:32.965
If we would like to sum just the first two values,

00:01:32.965 --> 00:01:35.200
we would write something like this.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.370
Notice at the bottom,

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.320
we are giving our starting point.

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:43.949
That is, we would like the first x value to be where i equals one.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.484
You can imagine replacing the one into this subscript.

00:01:47.484 --> 00:01:52.599
Then the value at the top gives us an ending point for where we stop.

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:55.604
Here, our ending is two.

00:01:55.605 --> 00:01:58.560
The Sigma tells us we would like to sum from

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.725
this bottom value up through all the values until we hit this top value.

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:07.515
The new notation, with the summation symbol,

00:02:07.515 --> 00:02:12.250
is the same as our original notation of x1 + x2.
