00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.059
Previously, we listed the four main aspects of analyzing quantitative data;

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:10.619
center, spread, shape and outliers.

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:13.529
We also looked specifically at measures of center,

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:17.445
by introducing means, medians and modes.

00:00:17.445 --> 00:00:19.704
Before we look at measures of spread,

00:00:19.704 --> 00:00:22.750
it's important to understand notation.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.179
You might not even know it,

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.024
but you use notation all the time.

00:00:27.024 --> 00:00:30.119
Consider this example, of five plus three.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.700
Plus is an English word.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.760
This symbol is notation and its universal.

00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:41.314
Notation is a common math language used to communicate.

00:00:41.314 --> 00:00:44.765
Regardless, of whether you speak English, Spanish,

00:00:44.765 --> 00:00:47.119
Greek or any other language,

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:52.519
you can work together using notation as a common language to solve problems.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.505
Like learning any new language,

00:00:54.505 --> 00:00:56.465
notation can be frightening at first,

00:00:56.465 --> 00:01:01.810
but it's an essential tool for communicating ideas associated with data.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:07.310
We will work together through some examples to assure you completely master this concept.
