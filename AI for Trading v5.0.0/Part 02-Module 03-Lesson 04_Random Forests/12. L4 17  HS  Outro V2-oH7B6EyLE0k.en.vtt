00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.724
In this lesson, we learned about a class of ensemble methods that uses

00:00:04.724 --> 00:00:10.754
random subsets of rows and columns to create a forest of different decision trees.

00:00:10.755 --> 00:00:13.350
We also learned a few reasons why they are

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.070
a good fit for some of the types of problems we encounter in finance.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.390
You may notice that certain Alphas perform better or worse,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.175
depending on market conditions.

00:00:23.175 --> 00:00:28.109
For instance, you may observe that a model that works well when the markets are calm,

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.695
no longer performs as well when the markets are very volatile.

00:00:31.695 --> 00:00:34.859
If we can create additional inputs that give

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:38.094
a model more context about market conditions,

00:00:38.094 --> 00:00:41.719
the model can learn to adjust its predictions accordingly.

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.009
The process of creating useful model inputs is called feature engineering,

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:49.149
which we'll learn more about in the next lesson.
