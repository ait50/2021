00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.279
Now, here's a potential problem with decision trees.

00:00:02.279 --> 00:00:05.339
Let's say we have a humongous table with lots and lots of columns.

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.564
So, we create our decision tree and let's say it looks like this.

00:00:08.564 --> 00:00:11.399
This is not a realistic tree though, just an example.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.589
We end up with answers like the following.

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:14.939
If a client is male,

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:16.304
between 15 and 25,

00:00:16.304 --> 00:00:18.329
in the US, on Android, in school,

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:20.879
like tennis, pizza but does not like long walks on the beach,

00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:23.234
then they're likely to download Pokemon Go.

00:00:23.234 --> 00:00:27.119
This is not good. This almost looks like the tree just memorize a data.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.170
It's overfitting. Decision trees tend to overfit a lot.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.410
In the continuous case, this can also happen and it looks like this.

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:37.139
The decision tree has many nodes which end up giving us

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.310
a complicated boundary that pretty much borders every point with a small square.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.719
This is also overfitting as it doesn't generalize well to the data.

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:49.144
So, how do we solve this in the simplest possible way? Take a look at this.

00:00:49.145 --> 00:00:51.260
Let's take our data and say,

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:53.225
pick some of the columns randomly.

00:00:53.225 --> 00:00:55.719
Build a decision tree in those columns.

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:58.250
Now, pick some other columns randomly and build

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.250
a decision tree and those, and do it again.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.740
Now, just let the trees vote.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.615
When we have a new data point,

00:01:05.614 --> 00:01:07.399
say this person over here,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.605
we just let all the trees make a prediction and pick the one that appears the most.

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:15.410
For example, these trees decided that

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.920
this person will download Snapchat, WhatsApp and WhatsApp.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.939
So, the ensemble of trees will recommend WhatsApp.
