00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
Let's discuss a useful performance metric that you can use whenever

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.699
your ensemble algorithm utilizes bagging or a random row selection.

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:13.679
Remember that bagging involves drawing a sample of the original datasets rows,

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.609
with replacement for each tree in the ensemble.

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.309
It can be shown, that on average,

00:00:20.309 --> 00:00:24.899
each tree makes use of about two-thirds of the observations.

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:28.724
The remaining one-third of the observations not used

00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:32.789
to fit a given tree are called the out-of-bag observations.

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:34.734
For a given observation,

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:38.149
we can calculate something called the out-of-bag score.

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.539
This is the aggregated prediction of all the trees that

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:45.259
did not have that observation in their bag.

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:51.189
Since, on average, each bag makes use of two-thirds of the original observations,

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:54.754
a given sample will be in two-thirds of the bags,

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:58.280
and not in one-third of the bags on average.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.179
So if B is the number of trees in the ensemble,

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:08.090
that will be B divided by three out-of-bag predictions for a given observation.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.405
These predictions can be aggregated to obtain

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:15.385
a single out-of-bag prediction for each observation.

00:01:15.385 --> 00:01:17.190
For a regression model,

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.269
they can be averaged,

00:01:18.269 --> 00:01:20.024
and for a classification model,

00:01:20.025 --> 00:01:22.295
the majority vote can be used.

00:01:22.295 --> 00:01:27.799
Then the out-of-bag error can be calculated for the entire dataset.

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.030
This is a useful way to obtain a test error metric,

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.015
since the trees used to obtain the prediction for

00:01:35.015 --> 00:01:39.870
each observation were not fit using that observation.
