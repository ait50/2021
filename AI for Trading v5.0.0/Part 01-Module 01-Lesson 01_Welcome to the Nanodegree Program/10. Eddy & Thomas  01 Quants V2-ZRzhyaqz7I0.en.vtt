00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
Hi. I'd like to introduce Thomas John,

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.550
who has been a Quant Researcher and Portfolio

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.840
Manager at BlackRock's systematic active equity,

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.665
as well as Goldman Sachs.

00:00:10.665 --> 00:00:13.665
Thomas is here to share what it's like to be a quant.

00:00:13.665 --> 00:00:15.705
Hi. I'm glad to be here.

00:00:15.705 --> 00:00:18.045
So Thomas, what is a quant?

00:00:18.045 --> 00:00:21.210
A quant is someone who's good at using technology,

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.045
math and statistics to solve business problems.

00:00:24.045 --> 00:00:28.380
This can take various forms and can be in different parts of the business.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.025
But the common factor in all of this is depth and fluency and

00:00:32.025 --> 00:00:36.900
quantitative skills that comes from a long background of having worked on this.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.365
The hallmark of a quant is total comfort with number-crunching.

00:00:41.365 --> 00:00:44.645
This doesn't necessarily mean that on any given day,

00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:48.875
a quant is working on very sophisticated math necessarily.

00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:52.130
But they're ready to deploy these skills as needed.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.235
Even in areas not previously mastered,

00:00:55.235 --> 00:00:58.190
a quant would be ready to jump in and pick

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.355
up the technical machinery needed to address the problem.

00:01:01.355 --> 00:01:04.910
I've never heard of a quant who backed away from some problem,

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.410
because it was too hard,

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:12.725
technically, usually only due to time constraints or other business reasons.

00:01:12.725 --> 00:01:16.460
This mindset and willingness to tackle hard problems

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.425
is essential to have in any large modern financial firm.

00:01:20.425 --> 00:01:23.450
There are other colleagues in these firms

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.825
who might be very skilled at other aspects of the business,

00:01:26.825 --> 00:01:29.410
but do not have the quant mindset.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.555
So quants bring something unique to the table.

00:01:32.555 --> 00:01:36.635
Interesting, what are the different types of quants?

00:01:36.635 --> 00:01:39.055
There are various types of quantrols,

00:01:39.055 --> 00:01:41.835
on both the sell side and the buy side.

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:45.680
On the sell side, you could be a quant on the trading desk,

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.305
working on models for pricing and trading,

00:01:48.305 --> 00:01:53.030
and also participating in building and running some parts of the trading infrastructure.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.390
In some firms, you can be a sales quant,

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.160
which is also an interesting role.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.345
Developing certain products and interacting more with clients.

00:02:02.345 --> 00:02:05.735
Pitching trade ideas based on the market environment,

00:02:05.735 --> 00:02:10.970
which if attractive to clients will be traded with the trading desk.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.680
As the name suggests,

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.095
the desk quants are attached to trading teams and the sales quant work with sales teams.

00:02:18.095 --> 00:02:21.785
In investment management, there are somewhat similar roles.

00:02:21.785 --> 00:02:25.445
In addition, there is the role of quantitative portfolio management.

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:31.385
There are also excellent quantrols such as risk modeling or roles in the middle office.

00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:34.700
Roles such as market risk and firm-wide risk.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.215
So Thomas, how did you decide to be a quant researcher and portfolio manager?

00:02:39.215 --> 00:02:43.320
It's one of the most interesting areas to work in if you have a clock background.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.960
I don't say that lightly because I come from an aerospace engineering background,

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.090
which was already very interesting.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.640
Finance is an ever-changing field,

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.370
where a lot of new things emerge and need to be

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.810
modeled and understood and one can have an impact rapidly.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.640
This can be very satisfying or unsettling depending on your type.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.845
The conversation and financial firms results are attractive on average.

00:03:08.845 --> 00:03:10.865
When I was coming out of graduate school,

00:03:10.865 --> 00:03:13.475
I wasn't going to complain about that either.

00:03:13.475 --> 00:03:18.590
What background knowledge do you recommend for those who want to be a quant?

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.600
That traditional background for a quant has been a strong knowledge of mathematics,

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.755
probability, and statistics, as well as competition.

00:03:27.755 --> 00:03:29.720
In addition to knowing a sufficient amount of

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.245
financial math and knowing how the markets work.

00:03:33.245 --> 00:03:37.250
For the last part, a candidate is expected to pick up as

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.590
much as they can if they don't already have some background in finance,

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.590
much will have to be learned with experience at work, of course.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.540
But for the quantrols,

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.730
you'd be expected to already be strong in

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.910
the non-financial skills like math and computation,

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.700
as they are harder to develop while working.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.470
Good point, what is the best way to develop market intuition?

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.360
There are different ways to do it.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.670
One is to have your own portfolio and see how the financial conditions impacted.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.755
Also, sometimes schools hold paper portfolio competitions for students.

00:04:12.755 --> 00:04:17.090
I also recommend that you read and soak in all the financial news you can

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.185
get your hands on from sources such as The Financial Times,

00:04:21.185 --> 00:04:23.285
Wall Street Journal, and Bloomberg.

00:04:23.285 --> 00:04:27.440
The Economist magazine also has a finance and economics section.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.920
So what does a typical day of a quant look like?

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.365
There is no such thing as a typical day.

00:04:33.365 --> 00:04:36.095
But count on heavy number-crunching,

00:04:36.095 --> 00:04:39.320
whether that is simple or complex can depend on the role.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.845
But what really matters is that it should have business impact.

00:04:42.845 --> 00:04:44.795
Great. Thanks so much for sharing.

00:04:44.795 --> 00:04:46.500
You are welcome.
