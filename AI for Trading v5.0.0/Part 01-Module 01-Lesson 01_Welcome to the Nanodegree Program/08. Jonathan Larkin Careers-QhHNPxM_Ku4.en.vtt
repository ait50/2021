00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.919
My name is Jonathan Larkin,

00:00:01.919 --> 00:00:04.529
and I've worked in quantitative finance now for

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.425
about 20 years at Investment Banks Hedge Funds and Fintech startups,

00:00:08.425 --> 00:00:11.460
and I'm very excited to be advising Udacity on this program.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.850
I wanted to become a quant trader,

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.769
because I was genuinely very,

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:18.449
very fascinated with the field.

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.684
It's an incredibly interdisciplinary field, to be successful,

00:00:22.684 --> 00:00:24.195
you have to draw upon

00:00:24.195 --> 00:00:27.780
pure technical skills in areas like computer science and mathematics,

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.945
but you also have to understand markets,

00:00:30.945 --> 00:00:33.405
understand psychology, and it needs to be able to

00:00:33.405 --> 00:00:36.045
bring that together in a commercial result.

00:00:36.045 --> 00:00:41.875
I really enjoy working with complex dynamic systems,

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:44.134
and I've always enjoyed that in

00:00:44.134 --> 00:00:49.229
various endeavors and there's nothing more complex than financial markets.

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:51.750
There's always something to learn.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.719
If I look back on my career spanning over 20 years,

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.744
I've seen things change in an extraordinary way.

00:00:59.744 --> 00:01:01.934
When I first started in the field,

00:01:01.935 --> 00:01:04.500
there was no algorithmic trading,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.935
now everything is completely automated.

00:01:06.935 --> 00:01:10.780
You'll find quants working across the entire financial industry these days.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.605
Most people associate the job of a quant with very well known quantitative hedge funds,

00:01:16.605 --> 00:01:20.505
and it is certainly true that quants work in that type of organization,

00:01:20.504 --> 00:01:25.229
but quants also work in commercial banks, proprietary trading firms,

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.810
asset management firms, data vendor firms,

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.385
and they also work across functions.

00:01:31.385 --> 00:01:37.535
You'll find quants working in many aspects of an investment organization.

00:01:37.534 --> 00:01:39.935
You'll find quants in the research function,

00:01:39.935 --> 00:01:42.710
those are quants looking for predictive signals and

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:45.765
data that can be applied downstream to a portfolio,

00:01:45.765 --> 00:01:49.609
you'll find quants working in risk management trying to

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:53.905
predict the risk of a particular portfolio or the risk firm wide.

00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:56.210
You'll find quants working in

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:01.569
portfolio construction combining the signals and models produced by other quants,

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:05.074
you'll also find quants working in data vendors,

00:02:05.075 --> 00:02:06.859
and data vendors who are preparing

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:10.300
unstructured data than to sell to the financial industry.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.575
The curriculum in this program is specifically designed

00:02:15.574 --> 00:02:21.009
to be very very practical and very applicable to the quant trading process,

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:22.689
both in a classical sense,

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:26.689
but also in the analysis of new data and then the

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:30.775
application of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques.

00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:34.594
As such, students coming out of this program should

00:02:34.594 --> 00:02:38.590
be very attractive candidates to go into quant-trading rules.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.805
The traditional way to become a quant is to get a stem based degree at a top university.

00:02:43.805 --> 00:02:49.110
Go to your Career Center and they'll introduce you to a host of financial firms,

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.900
you interview, you get an offer,

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.090
you join an analyst program and

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.409
then you get training and mentorship and you take it from there.

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:00.924
Quant firms have traditionally hired from say the top 20 universities.

00:03:00.925 --> 00:03:05.275
The problem with that is say for circumstantial reasons,

00:03:05.275 --> 00:03:09.080
the top talent in the world may not be at those 20 universities.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.250
Given that quant firms are in a war for talent,

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.379
and their success is dependent on

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:19.819
new innovative and diverse ideas coming from their employee base,

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:23.199
it really behooves them to cast the widest possible net.

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:27.519
The Udacity nanodegree, I'm confident will be

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.159
a strong feeder for this next generation of quant.
