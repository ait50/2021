00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.779
Now let's take a deep dive into the program,

00:00:02.779 --> 00:00:05.324
and talk about what you will learn in the next few months.

00:00:05.325 --> 00:00:07.815
First of all, to get the most out of this program,

00:00:07.815 --> 00:00:12.109
you'll ideally have Intermediate Python skills including Numpy and Pandas,

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:14.309
and prior exposure to statistics,

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.449
linear algebra, and calculus.

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.910
We've designed this program to be accessible to anyone who is passionate

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.829
about using advanced data analytics to make sense of financial data.

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:30.799
With that in mind, we will review certain bath encoding concepts as they are

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.310
used or point you to other Udacity resources to refresh your background knowledge.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.135
The Nadir degree program has two terms.

00:00:39.134 --> 00:00:43.594
Each term contains four projects and will take three months to complete.

00:00:43.594 --> 00:00:45.339
Prior to each project,

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.270
there's a set of lessons, quizzes,

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.275
and exercises that will introduce you to a topic and prepare you for the project.

00:00:52.274 --> 00:00:55.579
You will then practice what you've learned by completing the project.

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.659
Note that much of your learning will come from working on the project,

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:01.729
trying different things and even going

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:05.379
beyond what is required as you explore what's possible.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.899
We highly encourage you to take the time,

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.609
to make each project your own unique

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:14.844
reflection of what you have learned and what you are capable of.

00:01:14.844 --> 00:01:20.099
Students who successfully complete term one are eligible to enroll in term two.

00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:21.804
At the end of term two,

00:01:21.805 --> 00:01:25.610
you will embark on a Capstone Project which will give you the opportunity to use

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:30.034
everything you've learned to design and evaluate quantitative trading strategies.

00:01:30.034 --> 00:01:35.045
In term one, you will learn about the Fundamentals of Quantitative Finance.

00:01:35.045 --> 00:01:38.239
You will apply quantitative methods that are practiced in

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:41.434
the financial industry including regression,

00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:44.820
optimization, and trading signal generation.

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:47.329
You will work on projects that reflect

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.920
the actual quant workflow as it's done in financial firms,

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.814
with real data sets.

00:01:52.814 --> 00:01:56.689
Term one is designed to prepare you for term two,

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:00.009
which applies more advanced methods to the quant workflow.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.865
In term two, you'll use machine learning algorithms to generate trading signals.

00:02:04.864 --> 00:02:07.459
You'll use natural language processing to analyze

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:11.775
financial statements and apply recurrent neural networks to analyze news data.

00:02:11.775 --> 00:02:14.314
You'll get hands on practice with backtesting,

00:02:14.314 --> 00:02:19.585
which is a realistic simulation designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a strategy.

00:02:19.585 --> 00:02:22.610
Finally, you will use advanced techniques to

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.365
combine several trading signals together to optimize a portfolio.

00:02:26.365 --> 00:02:28.710
We hope that sounds exciting to you.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.879
We can't wait to see you in the classroom.
