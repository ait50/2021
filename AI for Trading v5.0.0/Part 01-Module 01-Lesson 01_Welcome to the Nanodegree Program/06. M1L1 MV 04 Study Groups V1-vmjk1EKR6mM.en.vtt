00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
Your study group is a small circle of students in

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.330
your degree program who will stick together throughout your whole experience.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.565
You'll find some mentors there too.

00:00:07.565 --> 00:00:11.405
Your study group is the place to go to talk about goal setting,

00:00:11.404 --> 00:00:13.609
work through problems with others in real time,

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:15.974
and just get to know some really cool, supportive people.

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:18.870
Research shows that teaching others allows you to apply

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.460
your learning in new ways that powerfully strengthen your mastery of material,

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.600
and your study group will give you plenty of opportunities for that.
