00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.915
Hi, I'm Liz.

00:00:01.915 --> 00:00:04.599
Welcome to the AI for trading nano degree program.

00:00:04.599 --> 00:00:10.140
And I'm Eddie. Financial markets have always been complex and in the past few decades,

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.870
the level of complexity has grown with advances

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:16.004
in modern technology and the growth of available data.

00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:18.279
But there's so much to process.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.560
From stock prices, earnings reports,

00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:22.785
and news articles, to social media,

00:00:22.785 --> 00:00:24.750
the list is seemingly endless.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.285
Is it even possible to make sense of it all?

00:00:27.285 --> 00:00:30.315
This is where quantitative financial analysts,

00:00:30.315 --> 00:00:33.175
or quants play an important role.

00:00:33.174 --> 00:00:34.664
But what does a quant?

00:00:34.664 --> 00:00:36.240
And what do quants do?

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.755
In the next video,

00:00:37.755 --> 00:00:39.423
you'll hear from Jonathan.

00:00:39.423 --> 00:00:44.009
A quant who has held senior roles in several major financial institutions,

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:46.399
and who has been instrumental in building

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.719
the nano degree program that you are now a part of.
