00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.844
Hey there. I'm Miriam and I work on student motivation and learning science at Udacity.

00:00:04.844 --> 00:00:07.830
I'll pop up at different moments throughout your needed degree experience,

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.550
to give you context for why we've designed your learning experience as we have.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.100
The goal of the entire Eudacity team is to support you in meeting your goals,

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.130
whether you're here to expand your understanding of topics you're interested in,

00:00:19.129 --> 00:00:21.369
or unlock a whole new stage of your career.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.660
To help you grow in the ways that you want to,

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.960
we're going to provide you with productive challenges that will stretch your brain,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.275
as well as powerful support from your community.

00:00:29.274 --> 00:00:32.439
We'll guide you in learning by doing, through your projects,

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.004
through helping out your fellow students,

00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:36.109
and through questions we asked you in the classroom to

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:38.664
let you play around with your new knowledge and skills.

00:00:38.664 --> 00:00:41.420
Actively engaging your brain in these ways will help you

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.530
develop deep, flexible, long-lasting learning.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.240
We can't wait to see where you go and what you do with all that you gain here.
