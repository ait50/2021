00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.049
As you've seen in this example, on Simpson's paradox,

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.580
the way you choose to look at your data can lead to completely different results.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.699
And often, you can majorly impact what people

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:15.869
believe to be true with how you choose to communicate your findings.

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:18.419
You can guess how people intentionally or

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.260
unintentionally come to false conclusions with these choices.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.960
Next, you're going to walk through a similar example of

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.410
Simpson's paradox on a full dataset in a Jupyter notebook.
