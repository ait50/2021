00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Who is being favored--the male students or the female students?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And looking at the data alone, it makes sense to say

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the female students are favored because for both majors,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
they have a better admission rate than the corresponding male students.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
But now, let's do the trick.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Let's look at the admission statistics independent of the major.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So, let's talk about both majors, and I would wonder how many male students applied.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And of course, the answer is 1000.

00:00:30.000 --> 99:59:59.000
How many were admitted?
