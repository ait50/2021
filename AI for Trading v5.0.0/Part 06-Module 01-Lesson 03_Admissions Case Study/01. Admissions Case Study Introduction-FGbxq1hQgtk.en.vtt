Welcome to the first lesson in the practical statistics course.

00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:05.895
In this case study,

00:00:05.894 --> 00:00:08.910
you're going to witness an instance of Simpson's paradox.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.109
A phenomenon that shows how powerful and dangerous statistics can be.

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:16.905
Sometimes just grouping your data differently for your analysis

00:00:16.905 --> 00:00:20.955
can make your conclusions disappear or even be reversed.

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:24.259
Let's walk through an interesting case study that demonstrates this.
