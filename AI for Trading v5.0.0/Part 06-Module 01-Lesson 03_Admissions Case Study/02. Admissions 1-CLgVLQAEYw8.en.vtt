00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The problem I'd like to tell you about is motivated by an actual study

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
the University of California Berkeley,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
which many years back wanted to know whether it's admissions procedure

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
is gender biased.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I looked at various admission statistics to understand whether than admissions policies

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
had a preference for a certain gender.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And while the numbers I'll be giving you are not the exact same that UC Berkeley found,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
the paradox is indeed the same and is often called, "Simpson's Paradox."

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I'm just giving you a simplified version of the problem.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Here is the data.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Among male students, we find that from 900 applicants in major A 450 are admitted.

00:00:49.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Please tell me what the acceptance rate is in percent.
