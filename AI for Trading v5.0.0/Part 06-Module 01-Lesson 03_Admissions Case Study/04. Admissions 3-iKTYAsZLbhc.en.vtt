00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The same statistic was run for female students.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Again, I made up the data to illustrate the effect.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Females tended to apply predominantly for major B with 900 applications for major B

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and just 100 for major A.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The university accepted 80 out of 100 applications in major A and 180 out of 900 in major B.

00:00:23.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Please tell me the rate of acceptance in percent for major A for the females student population.
