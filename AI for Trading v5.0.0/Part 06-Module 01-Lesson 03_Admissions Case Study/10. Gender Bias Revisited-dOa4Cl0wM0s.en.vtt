00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And surprisingly, when  you look at both majors together,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
you find that males have a much higher admissions rate than females.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I'm not making this up.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
These numbers might be fake, but that specific affect

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
was observed at the University of California at Berkley many years ago.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
But when you look at majors individually,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
then you find in each major individually

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
the acceptance rate for females trumps

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that of males, both in the first major and the second major.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Going from the individual major statistics to the total statistics,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
we haven't added anything.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We just regrouped the data.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So how come, when you do this,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
what looks like an admissions bias in favor of females

00:00:46.000 --> 99:59:59.000
switches into admissions bias in favor of males?
