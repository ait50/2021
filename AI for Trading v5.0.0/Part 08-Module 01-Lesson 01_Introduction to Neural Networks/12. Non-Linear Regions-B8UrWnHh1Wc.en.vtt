00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
Okay, so let's look more carefully at this model for accepting and rejecting students.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.025
Let's say we have this student four,

00:00:06.025 --> 00:00:07.334
who got nine in the test,

00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.905
but only one on the grades.

00:00:08.906 --> 00:00:12.000
According to our model this student gets accepted since it's

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.525
placed over here in the positive region of this line.

00:00:15.525 --> 00:00:17.804
But let's say we don't want that since we'll say,

00:00:17.803 --> 00:00:19.183
"If your grades were terrible,

00:00:19.184 --> 00:00:22.190
no matter what you got on the test, you won't get accepted".

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.565
So our data should look more like this instead.

00:00:25.565 --> 00:00:28.574
This model is much more realistic but now we have a problem

00:00:28.574 --> 00:00:32.329
which is the data can no longer be separated by just a line.

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.228
So what is the next thing after a line?

00:00:34.228 --> 00:00:37.232
Maybe a circle. A circle would work.

00:00:37.232 --> 00:00:40.574
Maybe two lines. That could work, too.

00:00:40.575 --> 00:00:42.240
Or maybe a curve like this.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.423
That would also work. So let's go with that.

00:00:44.423 --> 00:00:46.109
Let's go with the curve.

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:49.795
Now, unfortunately, the perceptron algorithm won't work for us this time.

00:00:49.795 --> 00:00:53.408
We'll have to come up with something more complex and actually the solution will be,

00:00:53.408 --> 00:00:55.868
we need to redefine our perceptron algorithm for

00:00:55.868 --> 00:01:00.000
a line in a way that it'll generalize to other types of curves.
