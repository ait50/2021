00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
Now that was when we had two classes namely receiving a gift or not receiving a gift.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.285
What happens if we have more classes? Let's take a look.

00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:10.790
So we have a similar problem.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.220
We still have three doors.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.940
And this problem is still not the Monty Hall problem.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.860
Behind each door there can be an animal,

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.140
and the animal can be of three types.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.555
It can be a duck, it can be a beaver,

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:23.575
or it can be a walrus.

00:00:23.575 --> 00:00:26.095
So let's look at this table of probabilities.

00:00:26.095 --> 00:00:28.485
According to the first column on the table,

00:00:28.485 --> 00:00:30.135
behind the first door,

00:00:30.135 --> 00:00:33.380
the probability of finding a duck is 0.7,

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.800
the probability of finding a beaver is 0.2,

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.080
and the probability of finding a walrus is 0.1.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.150
Notice that the numbers in each column need to add to

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.745
one because there is some animal behind door one.

00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:50.030
The numbers in the rows do not need to add to one as you can see.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.825
It could easly be that we have a duck behind every door and that's okay.

00:00:53.825 --> 00:00:55.590
So let's look at a sample scenario.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.225
Let's say we have our three doors,

00:00:57.225 --> 00:00:59.775
and behind the first door, there's a duck,

00:00:59.775 --> 00:01:02.040
behind the second door there's a walrus,

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.805
and behind the third door there's also a walrus.

00:01:04.805 --> 00:01:07.895
Recall that the probabilities are again by the table.

00:01:07.895 --> 00:01:11.555
So a duck behind the first door is 0.7 likely,

00:01:11.555 --> 00:01:14.870
a walrus behind the second door is 0.3 likely,

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.925
and a walrus behind the third door is 0.4 likely.

00:01:18.925 --> 00:01:21.930
So the probability of obtaining this three animals is the product of

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.470
the probabilities of the three events since they are independent events,

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.900
which in this case it's 0.084.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.285
And as we learn,

00:01:30.285 --> 00:01:33.000
that cross entropy here is given by

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.065
the sums of the negatives of the logarithms of the probabilities.

00:01:37.065 --> 00:01:40.720
So the first one is negative logarithm of 0.7.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.710
The second one is negative logarithm of 0.3.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.740
And the third one is negative logarithm of 0.4.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.255
The Cross entropy's and the sum of these three which is actually 2.48.

00:01:52.255 --> 00:01:55.490
But we want a formula, so let's put some variables here.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.187
So P11 is the probability of finding a duck behind door one.

00:02:00.187 --> 00:02:04.535
P12 is the probability of finding a duck behind door two etc.

00:02:04.535 --> 00:02:09.260
And let's have the indicator variables Y1j D1 if there's

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:14.790
a duck behind door J. Y2j B1 if there's a beaver behind door J,

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.285
and Y3j B1 if there's a walrus behind door J.

00:02:19.285 --> 00:02:21.935
And these variables are zero otherwise.

00:02:21.935 --> 00:02:24.210
And so, the formula for the cross entropy is

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.445
simply the negative of the summation from i_ equals_ one to n,

00:02:27.445 --> 00:02:35.630
up to summation from y_ equals_ j to m of Yij_ times_ the logarithm of Pij.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.150
In this case, m is a number of classes.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.330
This formula works because Yij being zero one,

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.135
makes sure that we're only adding the logarithms

00:02:45.135 --> 00:02:48.555
of the probabilities of the events that actually have occurred.

00:02:48.555 --> 00:02:53.760
And voila, this is the formula for the cross entropy in more classes.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.080
Now I'm going to leave this equestion.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.085
Given that we have a formula for cross entropy for two classes and one for m classes.

00:03:00.085 --> 00:03:04.240
These formulas look different but are they the same for m_ equals_ two?

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.565
Obviously the answer is yes,

00:03:05.565 --> 00:03:07.950
but it's a cool exercise to actually write them down and

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.000
convince yourself that they are actually the same.
