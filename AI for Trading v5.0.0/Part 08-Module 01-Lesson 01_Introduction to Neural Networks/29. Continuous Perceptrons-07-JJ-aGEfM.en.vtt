00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.139
So, this is just a small recap video that will get us ready for what's coming.

00:00:04.139 --> 00:00:06.809
Recall that if we have our data in the form of these points over

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:10.710
here and the linear model like this one, for example,

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.865
with equation 2x1 + 7x2 - 4 = 0,

00:00:14.865 --> 00:00:19.495
this will give rise to a probability function that looks like this.

00:00:19.495 --> 00:00:23.760
Where the points on the blue or positive region have more chance of being

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.570
blue and the points in the red or negative region have more chance of being red.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.609
And this will give rise to this perception where we label

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:36.314
the edges by the weights and the node by the bias.

00:00:36.314 --> 00:00:37.664
So, what the perception does,

00:00:37.664 --> 00:00:39.655
it takes to point (x1, x2),

00:00:39.655 --> 00:00:44.689
plots it in the graph and then it returns a probability that the point is blue.

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:47.378
In this case, it returns a 0.9

00:00:47.378 --> 00:00:51.200
and this mimics the neurons in the brain because they receive nervous impulses,

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.000
do something inside and return a nervous impulse.
