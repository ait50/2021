00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.549
Now, you may be wondering what happens if we have

00:00:02.549 --> 00:00:04.904
more data columns so not just testing grades,

00:00:04.905 --> 00:00:08.070
but maybe something else like the ranking of the student in the class.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.065
How do we fit three columns of data?

00:00:11.064 --> 00:00:12.809
Well the only difference is that now,

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.608
we won't be working in two dimensions,

00:00:14.608 --> 00:00:16.955
we'll be working in three.

00:00:16.954 --> 00:00:19.289
So now, we have three axis: x_1 for the test,

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.929
x_2 for the grades and x_3 for the class ranking.

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:23.625
And our data will look like this,

00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:26.899
like a bunch of blue and red points flying around in 3D.

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:29.607
On our equation won't be a line in two dimension,

00:00:29.608 --> 00:00:34.009
but a plane in three dimensions with a similar equation as before.

00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:40.434
Now, the equation would be w_1_x_1 plus w_2_x_2 plus w_3_x_3 plus b equals zero,

00:00:40.435 --> 00:00:43.950
which will separate this space into two regions.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.925
This equation can still be abbreviated by Wx plus b equals zero,

00:00:47.924 --> 00:00:52.489
except our vectors will now have three entries instead of two.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.810
And our prediction will still be y head equals one if

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.570
Wx plus b is greater than or equal to zero,

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.825
and zero if Wx plus b is less than zero.

00:01:00.825 --> 00:01:04.570
And what if we have many columns like say n of them?

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:09.429
Well, it's the same thing. Now, our data just leaps in n-dimensional space.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.120
Now, I have trouble picturing things in more than three dimensions.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.355
But if we can imagine that the points are just things with n coordinates called x_1, x_2,

00:01:17.355 --> 00:01:22.245
x_3 all the way up to x_n with our labels being y,

00:01:22.245 --> 00:01:26.865
then our boundaries just an n minus one dimensional hyperplane,

00:01:26.864 --> 00:01:32.084
which is a high dimensional equivalent of a line in 2D or a plane in 3D.

00:01:32.084 --> 00:01:33.209
And the equation of this n minus

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:36.384
one dimensional hyperplane is going to be w_1_x_1 plus w_2_x_2

00:01:36.384 --> 00:01:42.284
plus all the way to w_n_x_n plus b equals zero,

00:01:42.284 --> 00:01:46.048
which we can still abbreviate to Wx plus b equals zero,

00:01:46.048 --> 00:01:49.040
where our vectors now have n entries.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.745
And our prediction is still the same as before.

00:01:51.745 --> 00:01:55.530
It is y head equals one if Wx plus b is greater than or equal to

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.000
zero and y head equals zero if Wx plus b is less than zero.
