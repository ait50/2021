00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
Now, I'm going to leave you with the question.

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.644
Here is the XOR perceptron,

00:00:03.644 --> 00:00:05.310
which is very similar to the other two,

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.425
except this one returns a true if exactly

00:00:07.425 --> 00:00:10.200
one of the inputs is true and the other one is false,

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.130
so it returns this table.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.620
Now the question is,

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.005
can we turn this into a perceptron?

00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:19.590
These four points seem hard to separate by a line.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.720
We'll see what we can do in the quiz.
