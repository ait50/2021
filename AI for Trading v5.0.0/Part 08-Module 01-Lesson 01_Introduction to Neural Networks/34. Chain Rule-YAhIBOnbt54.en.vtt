00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.919
So before we start calculating derivatives,

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:04.980
let's do a refresher on the chain rule which

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.080
is the main technique we'll use to calculate them.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.390
The chain rule says, if you have a variable x on a function f that you

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.824
apply to x to get f of x, which we're gonna call A,

00:00:17.824 --> 00:00:19.809
and then another function g,

00:00:19.809 --> 00:00:23.604
which you apply to f of x to get g of f of x,

00:00:23.605 --> 00:00:26.760
which we're gonna call B, the chain rule says,

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.920
if you want to find the partial derivative of B with respect to x,

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.685
that's just a partial derivative of B with respect to

00:00:36.685 --> 00:00:41.704
A times the partial derivative of A with respect to x.

00:00:41.704 --> 00:00:43.184
So it literally says,

00:00:43.185 --> 00:00:47.605
when composing functions, that derivatives just multiply,

00:00:47.604 --> 00:00:50.344
and that's gonna be super useful for us because

00:00:50.344 --> 00:00:55.185
feed forwarding is literally composing a bunch of functions,

00:00:55.185 --> 00:01:00.554
and back propagation is literally taking the derivative at each piece,

00:01:00.554 --> 00:01:03.344
and since taking the derivative of a composition

00:01:03.344 --> 00:01:06.756
is the same as multiplying the partial derivatives,

00:01:06.756 --> 00:01:10.290
then all we're gonna do is multiply a bunch of

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.130
partial derivatives to get what we want. Pretty simple, right?
