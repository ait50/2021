00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.305
So let me be more specific.

00:00:02.305 --> 00:00:05.128
Let's look at the following four points: two blue and two red

00:00:05.128 --> 00:00:08.189
and two models that classify them,

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.740
the one on the left and the one on the right.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.515
Quick. Which model looks better? You are correct.

00:00:14.515 --> 00:00:17.219
The model on the right is much better since it

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:20.399
classifies the four points correctly whereas

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:26.625
the model in the left gets two points correctly and two points incorrectly.

00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:31.065
But let's see why the model in the right is better from the probability perspective.

00:00:31.065 --> 00:00:33.840
And by that, we'll show you that the arrangement in the right is

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.289
much more likely to happen than the one in the left.

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:42.228
So let's recall that our prediction is ŷ = σ(Wx+b) and that that

00:00:42.228 --> 00:00:48.240
is precisely the probability of a point being labeled positive which means blue.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.755
So for the points in the figure,

00:00:49.755 --> 00:00:53.219
let's say the model tells you that the probability of being blue are 0.9,

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.835
0.6, 0.3, and 0.2.

00:00:56.835 --> 00:00:59.640
Notice that the points in the blue region are much more likely to be

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.649
blue and the points in the red region are much less likely to be blue.

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:08.064
Now obviously, the probability of being red is one minus the probability of being blue.

00:01:08.063 --> 00:01:12.083
So in this case, the probability of some of the points being red are 0.1,

00:01:12.084 --> 00:01:16.319
0.4, 0.7 and 0.8.

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:19.334
Now what we want to do is we want to calculate the probability of

00:01:19.334 --> 00:01:23.844
the four points are of the colors that they actually are.

00:01:23.843 --> 00:01:26.500
This means the probability that the two red points

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.099
are red and that the two blue points are blue.

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:33.969
Now if we assume that the colors of the points are independent events then

00:01:33.968 --> 00:01:36.140
the probability for the whole arrangement is

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.290
the product of the probabilities of the four points.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:48.715
This is equal to 0.1 × 0.6 × 0.7 × 0.2 = 0.0084. This is very small.

00:01:48.715 --> 00:01:50.465
It's less than 1%.

00:01:50.465 --> 00:01:54.939
What we mean by this is that if the model is given by these probability spaces,

00:01:54.938 --> 00:02:00.388
then the probability that the points are of these colors is 0.0084.

00:02:00.388 --> 00:02:02.530
Now let's do this for both models.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.629
As we saw the model on the left tells us that the probabilities of

00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:10.485
these points being of those colors is 0.0084.

00:02:10.485 --> 00:02:12.675
If we do the same thing for the model on the right.

00:02:12.675 --> 00:02:15.020
Let's say we get that the probabilities of the two points in

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.699
the right being blue are 0.7 and

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:23.259
0.9 and of the two points in the left being red are 0.8 and 0.6.

00:02:23.258 --> 00:02:28.468
When we multiply these we get 0.3024 which is around 30%.

00:02:28.468 --> 00:02:31.763
This is much higher than 0.0084.

00:02:31.764 --> 00:02:35.159
Thus, we confirm that the model on the right is better because it makes

00:02:35.158 --> 00:02:39.478
the arrangement of the points much more likely to have those colors.

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:41.009
So now, what we do is the following?

00:02:41.008 --> 00:02:42.404
We start from the bad modeling,

00:02:42.405 --> 00:02:45.645
calculate the probability that the points are those colors,

00:02:45.645 --> 00:02:50.780
multiply them and we obtain the total probability is 0.0084.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.968
Now if we just had a way to maximize this probability we can increase

00:02:53.968 --> 00:02:57.585
it all the way to 0.3024.

00:02:57.585 --> 00:03:00.775
Thus, our new goal becomes precisely that,

00:03:00.775 --> 00:03:03.104
to maximize this probability.

00:03:03.104 --> 00:03:05.879
This method, as we stated before,

00:03:05.878 --> 00:03:08.000
is called maximum likelihood.
