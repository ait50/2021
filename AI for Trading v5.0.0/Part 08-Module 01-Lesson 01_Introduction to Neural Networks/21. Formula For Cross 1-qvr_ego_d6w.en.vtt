00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.310
So this cross entropy, it looks like kind of a big deal.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.879
Cross entropy really says the following.

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.105
If I have a bunch of events and a bunch of probabilities,

00:00:09.105 --> 00:00:13.350
how likely is it that those events happen based on the probabilities?

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.759
If it's very likely,

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.684
then we have a small cross entropy.

00:00:16.684 --> 00:00:21.299
If it's unlikely, then we have a large cross entropy. Let's elaborate.
