00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.459
So, let's go back to this example of where we saw

00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:04.769
some data that is not linearly separable.

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:09.740
So a line can not divide these red and blue points and we looked at some solutions,

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.185
and if you remember, the one we considered more seriously was this curve over here.

00:00:14.185 --> 00:00:18.664
So what I'll teach you now is to find this curve and it's very similar than before.

00:00:18.664 --> 00:00:20.519
We'll still use grading dissent.

00:00:20.518 --> 00:00:23.009
In a nutshell, what we're going to do is for

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.769
these data which is not separable with a line,

00:00:25.768 --> 00:00:30.599
we're going to create a probability function where the points in the blue region are more

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.240
likely to be blue and the points in the red region are more likely to be red.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.798
And this curve here that separates them is

00:00:39.798 --> 00:00:44.329
a set of points which are equally likely to be blue or red.

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.789
Everything will be the same as before except this equation

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.000
won't be linear and that's where neural networks come into play.
