00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.959
So far we have models that give us an answer of

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:07.099
yes/no or the probability of a label being positive or negative.

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:08.605
What if we have more classes?

00:00:08.605 --> 00:00:11.300
What if we want our model to tell us if something is red,

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.160
blue, yellow or dog, cat, bird?

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.250
In this video I'll show you what to do.
