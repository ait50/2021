00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:07.140
Let's look a bit closer into Cross-Entropy by switching to a different example.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.935
Let's say we have three doors.

00:00:08.935 --> 00:00:11.330
And no this is not the Monty Hall problem.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.775
We have the green door, the red door,

00:00:13.775 --> 00:00:18.720
and the blue door, and behind each door we could have a gift or not have a gift.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.150
And the probabilities of there being a gift behind each door is 0.8 for the first one,

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.935
0.7 for the second one,

00:00:24.935 --> 00:00:26.900
0.1 for the third one.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.805
So for example behind the green door

00:00:29.805 --> 00:00:33.155
there is an 80 percent probability of there being a gift,

00:00:33.155 --> 00:00:36.780
and a 20 percent probability of there not being a gift.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.610
So we can put the information in this table where

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.970
the probabilities of there being a gift are given in the top row,

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.630
and the probabilities of there not being a gift are given in the bottom row.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.180
So let's say we want to make a bet on the outcomes.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.375
So we want to try to figure out what is the most likely scenario here.

00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:56.880
And for that we'll assume they're independent events.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.870
In this case, the most likely scenario is just

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.440
obtained by picking the largest probability in each column.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.875
So for the first door is more likely to have a gift than not have a gift.

00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:09.230
So we'll say there's a gift behind the first door.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.680
For the second door, it's also more likely that there's a gift.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.995
So we'll say there's a gift behind the second door.

00:01:14.995 --> 00:01:18.060
And for the third door it's much more likely that there's no gift,

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.015
so we'll say there's no gift behind the third door.

00:01:21.015 --> 00:01:22.700
And as the events are independent,

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.810
the probability for this whole arrangement is

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.995
the product of the three probabilities which is 0.8,

00:01:27.995 --> 00:01:31.096
times 0.7, times 0.9,

00:01:31.096 --> 00:01:33.446
which ends up being 0.504,

00:01:33.446 --> 00:01:36.665
which is roughly 50 percent.

00:01:36.665 --> 00:01:39.680
So let's look at all the possible scenarios in the table.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.085
Here's a table with all the possible scenarios for each door

00:01:43.085 --> 00:01:46.940
and there are eight scenarios since each door gives us two possibilities each,

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.815
and there are three doors.

00:01:48.815 --> 00:01:51.545
So we do as before to obtain the probability of

00:01:51.545 --> 00:01:57.245
each arrangement by multiplying the three independent probabilities to get these numbers.

00:01:57.245 --> 00:01:59.590
You can check that these numbers add to one.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.570
And from last video we learned that the negative

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.955
of the logarithm of the probabilities across entropy.

00:02:05.955 --> 00:02:09.050
So let's go ahead and calculate the cross-entropy.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.080
And notice that the events with high probability have

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.345
low cross-entropy and the events with low probability have high cross-entropy.

00:02:16.345 --> 00:02:19.130
For example, the second row which has probability of

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.440
0.504 gives a small cross-entropy of 0.69,

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.675
and the second to last row which is very very unlikely has a probability of

00:02:28.675 --> 00:02:34.441
0.006 gives a cross entropy a 5.12.

00:02:34.441 --> 00:02:37.573
So let's actually calculate a formula for the cross-entropy.

00:02:37.573 --> 00:02:39.215
Here we have our three doors,

00:02:39.215 --> 00:02:44.180
and our sample scenario said that there is a gift behind the first and second doors,

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.445
and no gift behind the third door.

00:02:46.445 --> 00:02:49.370
Recall that the probabilities of these events happening

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.189
are 0.8 for a gift behind the first door,

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:54.665
0.7 for a gift behind the second door,

00:02:54.665 --> 00:02:57.915
and 0.9 for no gift behind the third door.

00:02:57.915 --> 00:02:59.510
So when we calculate the cross-entropy,

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.622
we get the negative of the logarithm of the product,

00:03:03.622 --> 00:03:08.015
which is a sum of the negatives of the logarithms of the factors,

00:03:08.015 --> 00:03:14.070
which is negative logarithm of 0.8 minus logarithm of 0.7 minus logarithm 0.9.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.225
And in order to drive the formula we'll have some variables.

00:03:17.225 --> 00:03:20.885
So let's call P1 the probability that there's a gift behind the first door,

00:03:20.885 --> 00:03:24.110
P2 the probability there's a gift behind the second door,

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.940
and P3 the probability there's a gift behind the third door.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.580
So this 0.8 here is P1,

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.580
this 0.7 here is P2,

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.370
and this 0.9 here is one minus P3.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.990
So it's a probability of there not being

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.460
a gift is one minus the probability of there being a gift.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.785
Let's have another variable called Yi,

00:03:43.785 --> 00:03:46.980
which will be one of there's a present behind the ith door,

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.750
and zero there's no present.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.470
So Yi is technically a number of presents behind the ith door.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.442
In this case Y1 equals one,

00:03:55.442 --> 00:04:00.210
Y2 equals one, and Y3 equals zero.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.550
So we can put all this together and derive a formula

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.355
for the cross-entropy and it's this sum.

00:04:05.355 --> 00:04:08.305
Now let's look at the formula inside the summation.

00:04:08.305 --> 00:04:12.155
Noted that if there is a present behind the ith door,

00:04:12.155 --> 00:04:14.300
then Yi equals one.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.180
So the first term is logarithm of the Pi.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.795
And the second term is zero.

00:04:19.795 --> 00:04:24.285
Likewise, if there is no present behind the ith door,

00:04:24.285 --> 00:04:26.355
then Yi is zero.

00:04:26.355 --> 00:04:28.355
So this first term is zero.

00:04:28.355 --> 00:04:32.655
And this term is precisely logarithm of one minus Pi.

00:04:32.655 --> 00:04:35.785
Therefore, this formula really encompasses the sums of the

00:04:35.785 --> 00:04:39.935
negative of logarithms which is precisely the cross-entropy.

00:04:39.935 --> 00:04:45.640
So the cross-entropy really tells us when two vectors are similar or different.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:52.170
For example, if you calculate the cross entropy of the pair one one zero,

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.485
and 0.8, 0.7, 0.1, we get 0.69.

00:04:53.485 --> 00:05:00.500
And that is low because one one zero is a similar vector to 0.8, 0.7, 0.1.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.510
Which means that the arrangement of gifts given by the first set of

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.270
numbers is likely to happen based

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.715
on the probabilities given by the second set of numbers.

00:05:11.715 --> 00:05:17.107
But on the other hand if we calculate the cross-entropy of the pairs zero zero one,

00:05:17.107 --> 00:05:19.559
and 0.8, 0.7, 0.1,

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:23.210
that is 5.12 which is very high.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.380
This is because the arrangement of gifts being given by the first set of numbers is

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.030
very unlikely to happen from the probabilities given by the second set of numbers.
