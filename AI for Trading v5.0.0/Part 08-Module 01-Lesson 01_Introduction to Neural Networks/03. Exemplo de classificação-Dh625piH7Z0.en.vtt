00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.548
So, let's start with one classification example.

00:00:02.548 --> 00:00:04.080
Let's say we are the admissions office at

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.339
a university and our job is to accept or reject students.

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:08.730
So, in order to evaluate students,

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.346
we have two pieces of information,

00:00:10.346 --> 00:00:14.698
the results of a test and their grades in school.

00:00:14.698 --> 00:00:17.073
So, let's take a look at some sample students.

00:00:17.074 --> 00:00:21.800
We'll start with Student 1 who got 9 out of 10 in the test and 8 out of 10 in the grades.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.844
That student did quite well and got accepted.

00:00:24.844 --> 00:00:29.524
Then we have Student 2 who got 3 out of 10 in the test and 4 out of 10 in the grades,

00:00:29.524 --> 00:00:32.000
and that student got rejected.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.310
And now, we have a new Student 3 who got 7 out of

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.923
10 in the test and 6 out of 10 in the grades,

00:00:36.923 --> 00:00:40.795
and we're wondering if the student gets accepted or not.

00:00:40.795 --> 00:00:44.630
So, our first way to find this out is to plot students in a graph with

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.000
the horizontal axis corresponding to the score on

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.950
the test and the vertical axis corresponding to the grades,

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.020
and the students would fit here.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.189
The students who got three and four gets located in the point with coordinates (3,4),

00:00:58.189 --> 00:01:04.560
and the student who got nine and eight gets located in the point with coordinates (9,8).

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.640
And now we'll do what we do in most of our algorithms,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.890
which is to look at the previous data.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.075
This is how the previous data looks.

00:01:12.075 --> 00:01:15.153
These are all the previous students who got accepted or rejected.

00:01:15.153 --> 00:01:17.673
The blue points correspond to students that got accepted,

00:01:17.674 --> 00:01:20.859
and the red points to students that got rejected.

00:01:20.858 --> 00:01:23.274
So we can see in this diagram that the students would did

00:01:23.274 --> 00:01:25.864
well in the test and grades are more likely to get accepted,

00:01:25.864 --> 00:01:29.805
and the students who did poorly in both are more likely to get rejected.

00:01:29.805 --> 00:01:31.325
So let's start with a quiz.

00:01:31.325 --> 00:01:35.189
The quiz says, does the Student 3 get accepted or rejected?

00:01:35.188 --> 00:01:38.000
