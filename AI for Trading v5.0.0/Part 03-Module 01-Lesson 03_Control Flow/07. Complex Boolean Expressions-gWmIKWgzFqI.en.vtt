00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:07.910
All the if and elif statements we've seen so far have been

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.714
followed by a single Boolean expression that checks only one condition.

00:00:12.714 --> 00:00:17.579
However, more complicated Boolean expressions can be useful as well.

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:20.584
If the condition is working with the numerical variable,

00:00:20.585 --> 00:00:23.359
you might want to check whether a value lies in

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:28.704
a certain range or even do some calculation in order to make a comparison.

00:00:28.704 --> 00:00:32.429
Notice this condition uses logic and algebra,

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:35.295
and will still run correctly in Python.

00:00:35.295 --> 00:00:38.145
Storing values for height and weight,

00:00:38.145 --> 00:00:41.395
we can quickly print the result for any individual.

00:00:41.395 --> 00:00:45.385
Some situations may call for logical operators.

00:00:45.384 --> 00:00:47.384
If it's rainy and sunny,

00:00:47.384 --> 00:00:49.414
I might look for a rainbow.

00:00:49.414 --> 00:00:53.200
Notice that the if statement here requires that both of

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.815
these individual variables hold true to evaluate as true.

00:00:57.814 --> 00:00:59.439
If either is false,

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:02.229
then this line will evaluate as false,

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.854
and our print statement will not run.

00:01:04.855 --> 00:01:08.980
Let's say I want to send a promotional email to a customer,

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.160
if they have not requested to be taken off the email list,

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.009
and they're in a location where they'll be able to redeem the offer.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.370
For really complicated conditions,

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.635
you might need to combine some ands,

00:01:20.635 --> 00:01:22.870
ors, and nots together.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.250
Use parentheses if you need to make the combinations clear.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.230
However, simple or complex,

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.020
the entire line in an if statement must be

00:01:32.019 --> 00:01:36.564
a Boolean expression that evaluates to either true or false,

00:01:36.564 --> 00:01:39.459
and it is this value that decides whether the

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:43.000
indented block in an if statement executes or not.
