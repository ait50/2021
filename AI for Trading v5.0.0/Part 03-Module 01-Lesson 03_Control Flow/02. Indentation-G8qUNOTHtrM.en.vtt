00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:06.835
As you have just seen, indentation is important.

00:00:06.835 --> 00:00:11.384
It's how we tell Python what code is in the body of an if statement,

00:00:11.384 --> 00:00:13.695
and what code is outside of it.

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:17.144
Indentation doesn't just matter in if statements.

00:00:17.144 --> 00:00:20.280
Soon, you'll see it used in other contexts.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:26.100
Some other languages use braces to show where blocks of code begin and end.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.975
In Python, we use indentation to enclose blocks of code.

00:00:30.975 --> 00:00:36.329
This indentation conventionally comes in multiples of four spaces.

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.329
It's important to be strict about following this convention because

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.780
changing the indentation can completely change the meaning of the code.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.314
If you are working on a team of Python programmers,

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:52.059
it's important that everyone follows the same indentation convention.
