00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.174
Welcome to this lesson on Control Flow.

00:00:05.174 --> 00:00:08.309
Here, you'll learn how to add more functionality to

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.554
your code by being able to use conditional statements and loops.

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:16.170
You'll learn how to implement decision-making with if statements,

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.170
repeat code with for and while loops,

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.410
exit or skip loops with break and continue,

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.070
use helpful built-in functions like zip and enumerate,

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.240
and combine some of these concepts in concise list comprehensions.

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:35.189
With these tools, you'll be able to bring together the data types and operators you

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:40.379
learned from the previous lesson in more complex and creative ways. Let's get started.
