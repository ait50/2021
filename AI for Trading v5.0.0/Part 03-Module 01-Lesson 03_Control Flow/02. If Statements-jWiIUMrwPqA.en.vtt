00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:08.745
We've been running code that simply executes every line one by one from the top down.

00:00:08.744 --> 00:00:14.339
Many times however, we want to run code only if a particular condition holds.

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:16.364
To demonstrate this concept,

00:00:16.364 --> 00:00:20.894
let's take a look at this billing system for a pay-as-you-go mobile phone.

00:00:20.894 --> 00:00:23.429
Say a customer has a credit balance for

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:27.225
their phone which they can use for calls and messages.

00:00:27.225 --> 00:00:31.080
The customer can then set up a link to their bank account so that

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:34.769
if their phone credit balance goes below a threshold amount,

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.765
in this case five dollars,

00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:41.689
then 10 more dollars of credit are added and their bank balance is build.

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:46.429
Here is a simple way of representing this billing system in code.

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:49.009
If the phone balance is below five,

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:53.629
add 10 to phone balance and subtract 10 from bank balance.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.795
This is an example of an if statement.

00:00:56.795 --> 00:01:00.770
An if statement is a conditional statement that runs or

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.465
skips code based on whether a condition is true or false.

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:10.475
In an if statement, the if keyword is followed by the condition to be checked,

00:01:10.474 --> 00:01:13.131
in this case, phone balanced less than five,

00:01:13.132 --> 00:01:15.380
and then a colon.

00:01:15.379 --> 00:01:16.989
The condition is specified in

00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:21.664
a Boolean expression that evaluates to either true or false.

00:01:21.665 --> 00:01:27.815
After this line is an indented block of code to be executed if the condition is true.

00:01:27.814 --> 00:01:29.435
So in this case,

00:01:29.435 --> 00:01:35.030
these lines will only execute if it is true that phone balance is less than five.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.909
If phone balance is three,

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.859
this condition evaluates to true and these indented lines of code are executed.

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:46.549
You can observe these changes in the output.

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.439
If phone balance is eight however,

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:53.370
this condition evaluates to false and these lines are not executed.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.290
As you see in the output,

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.109
there were no changes to phone or bank balance,

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:03.200
which is what we expect to happen since the condition in this if statement was false.
