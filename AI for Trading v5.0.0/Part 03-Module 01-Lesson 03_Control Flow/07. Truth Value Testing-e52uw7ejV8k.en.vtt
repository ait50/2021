00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:06.269
So far, the conditions we've used were

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:10.140
Boolean expressions that evaluate to a Boolean object,

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.955
either true or false.

00:00:12.955 --> 00:00:17.679
If we put some other object that is not a Boolean in the IF statement,

00:00:17.678 --> 00:00:20.549
Python will check for its truth value and

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.515
use that to decide whether or not to run the indented code.

00:00:24.515 --> 00:00:29.875
Here, the condition is an integer variable and evaluates to true.

00:00:29.875 --> 00:00:32.350
The Python documentation lists

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.450
all the objects that are considered false in this situation.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.320
Anything that isn't listed as having a truth value false will evaluate as true.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.424
In this code, errors has a truth value true because it's a non-zero number.

00:00:48.424 --> 00:00:51.169
So the error message is printed.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.060
This is a nice way of writing a succinct IF statement.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.760
Similarly, in this example you saw earlier,

00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:03.984
the string in the second part of this condition will evaluate to true.

00:01:03.984 --> 00:01:07.250
So this statement will always evaluate to true

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.293
regardless of what value is stored in weather.

00:01:11.293 --> 00:01:16.920
Alternatively, this will evaluate to true If weather is the string snow,

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.099
and will evaluate to false if weather is any other string.

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:24.600
However, these types of conditions aren't

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:28.000
really common knowledge and are not common in practice.
