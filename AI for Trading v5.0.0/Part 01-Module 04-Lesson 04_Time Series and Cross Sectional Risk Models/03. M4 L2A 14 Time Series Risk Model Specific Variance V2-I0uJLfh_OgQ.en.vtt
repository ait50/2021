00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
We can also use the results of the regression to

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.515
estimate a time series for the specific return.

00:00:06.514 --> 00:00:08.275
For each time period,

00:00:08.275 --> 00:00:09.990
the specific return is

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.690
the residual from taking the actual minus estimated excess return of the stock.

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:21.230
The actual return is data that we just used to input into the regression.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.609
The estimated return is calculated by using the market return and

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:31.559
the regression estimates for the factor exposure and the intercept term.

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:33.679
If we calculate the difference between

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:37.399
actual and estimated returns for multiple time periods,

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.259
this is an estimate for the specific return time series.

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:45.934
The variance of the specific return can be used in the risk model.

00:00:45.935 --> 00:00:51.585
Similarly, we can also calculate the specific return of the second stock,

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:55.325
then calculate the variance of that specific return.

00:00:55.325 --> 00:01:00.270
Note that calculating specific variance is also not a settled science.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.575
The time window chosen affects the result.

00:01:03.575 --> 00:01:07.370
This difference between actual and estimated return,

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.370
which we often refer to as the residual return,

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.900
is what we're calling the specific return in this context.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.995
If you're working in quant finance,

00:01:15.995 --> 00:01:17.920
you may hear an expression like,

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.719
the returns that are not explained by the model

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:24.515
or the returns that are not explained by the factors.

00:01:24.515 --> 00:01:29.254
Since the goal of risk factor models is to explain where the returns of assets

00:01:29.254 --> 00:01:34.349
came from by breaking them down into well-defined components or factors,

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:39.929
anything left over that is unexplained is represented by the residual.
