00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.930
What we've seen so far are called time series risk models.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.015
Most practitioners tend to buy

00:00:06.014 --> 00:00:09.919
commercial risk models that are built and maintained by other companies.

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:13.644
These commercial risk models tend to be a different type of risk model,

00:00:13.644 --> 00:00:16.035
a cross-sectional risk model.

00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:20.890
The use of cross-sectional risk models is quite common within the investment industry.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.190
So, even though it is unlikely that you will have to

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.035
implement a cross-sectional risk model from scratch,

00:00:26.035 --> 00:00:29.085
it is good to have a sense for how they work.

00:00:29.085 --> 00:00:32.799
So, what is a cross-sectional risk model,

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:36.404
and how is it different from time series risk model?

00:00:36.405 --> 00:00:41.240
Well, let us first see how a cross-section differs from a time series.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.005
If we have lots of data on a single stock over time,

00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:46.929
this is a time series.

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:51.280
If we have lots of data on many stocks in a single time period,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.185
such as one day then that is a cross-section.

00:00:55.185 --> 00:00:59.510
For risk models, a cross-sectional factor model also differs from

00:00:59.509 --> 00:01:02.089
a time series factor model in terms of

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.780
what is known and what is estimated by a regression.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.405
Let us look at the factor model has a bunch of factor exposures and factor returns.

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:13.674
When we use a time series model,

00:01:13.674 --> 00:01:18.579
the factor returns were calculated first using theoretical portfolios.

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:22.819
Then, given the factor returns data and the stock returns,

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:27.484
the factor exposures were estimated using regression.

00:01:27.484 --> 00:01:32.640
With the cross-sectional factor model we would actually calculate the factor exposures,

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.454
the betas before doing a regression,

00:01:35.454 --> 00:01:39.034
then the factor returns are estimated using regression.

00:01:39.034 --> 00:01:42.829
This may sound pretty confusing at first, I have to admit,

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.069
it was confusing to me after hearing it for the first time,

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:49.039
and also second time and the third time.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.870
Let us look at this topic a bit more.
