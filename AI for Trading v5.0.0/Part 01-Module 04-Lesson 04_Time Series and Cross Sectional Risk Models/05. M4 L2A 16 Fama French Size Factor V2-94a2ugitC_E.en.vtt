00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
Now, we'll build upon the previous risk model by

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.710
including two additional factors for a total of three.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.455
This is the famous Fama-French model,

00:00:09.455 --> 00:00:14.160
which can be considered the model that started the movement towards multi-factor models.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.355
The original three-factor Fama-French model includes the market return,

00:00:18.355 --> 00:00:20.440
and adds two additional factors,

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.070
which the other's called size and value.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.335
Let's look at these two additional factors,

00:00:26.335 --> 00:00:29.094
and how the data for them are generated.

00:00:29.094 --> 00:00:33.114
The first additional factor we will look at is size.

00:00:33.115 --> 00:00:36.615
The size of a company is measured by its market cap.

00:00:36.615 --> 00:00:38.304
There's been evidence that shows,

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:43.939
that small-cap companies have higher average returns compared to large-cap companies.

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:49.614
In other words, if we can determine that company ABC is a small-cap stock,

00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:53.365
valued at one billion dollars, and company XYZ,

00:00:53.365 --> 00:00:56.620
is a large cap stock valued at $10 billion,

00:00:56.619 --> 00:01:00.159
then we could expect that company ABC will have

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:04.719
higher risk adjusted returns, compared to XYZ.

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:09.174
The question is how much more return can we expect for company

00:01:09.174 --> 00:01:13.679
ABC for being a fraction of the size of XYZ?

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.550
Remember that we're trying to fill in the factor risk model.

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.799
The factor covariance matrix uses the time series of factor returns for

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.905
the three factors: market, size and value.

00:01:27.905 --> 00:01:30.120
Well, if you had evidence,

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.390
that small cap stocks had higher than average returns,

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.340
than large-cap stocks, what would you do as

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.210
a rational investor to make use of this knowledge?

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.305
One way that seems to make sense is to buy small-cap stocks,

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:48.050
and to short large-cap stocks.

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:53.810
If we had a portfolio in which you bought small-cap stocks and shorted large-cap stocks,

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.075
we could track the portfolio's value over time so we'd have a time series.

00:01:59.075 --> 00:02:03.270
We could also calculate the daily return on this portfolio.

00:02:03.269 --> 00:02:08.134
The return of this portfolio is the return of the size factor.

00:02:08.134 --> 00:02:11.739
Let's think about what this portfolio tells us.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.760
If the portfolio's return is positive,

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:16.644
it means that on that day,

00:02:16.645 --> 00:02:21.909
favoring small cap stocks had a positive effect on the portfolio's return.

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.754
If the portfolio's return is negative,

00:02:24.754 --> 00:02:26.590
then it means that on that day,

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.555
favoring small cap stocks had a negative effect on the portfolio's return.

00:02:31.555 --> 00:02:33.275
So that's pretty cool.

00:02:33.275 --> 00:02:36.455
We have a way of quantifying whether a smaller size

00:02:36.455 --> 00:02:41.180
actually adds to positive or negative returns on each day.
