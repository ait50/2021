00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.504
If we look again at our risk model,

00:00:02.504 --> 00:00:04.980
we can see that we've got estimates for each

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.985
of the variables in several of these matrices.

00:00:07.985 --> 00:00:14.294
In particular, we are able to fill in the matrix of factor variances and covariances,

00:00:14.294 --> 00:00:21.710
the matrix of factor exposures and the matrix of specific variances.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.075
The product of factor exposures to factor variances and covariances

00:00:27.074 --> 00:00:33.344
plus specific variances is essentially the covariance matrix of the stocks.

00:00:33.344 --> 00:00:38.390
The stock weights in the matrices at the left and right end of this expression can

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.730
be multiplied to this covariance matrix of assets to get the portfolio variance.

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:45.414
In a later lesson,

00:00:45.414 --> 00:00:48.100
you'll learn about choosing optimal portfolio weights.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.115
But for now, you can think of that inner core,

00:00:51.115 --> 00:00:53.414
the covariance matrix of assets,

00:00:53.414 --> 00:00:56.990
as the plug-and-play component that we can insert into

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:02.890
various portfolios that contained a subset of the assets contained in that matrix.
