00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.585
Let's step back and look at an equation z equals x times y.

00:00:04.585 --> 00:00:07.080
If we knew both z and x,

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.365
then we can solve for y.

00:00:09.365 --> 00:00:12.734
Similarly, if we knew both z and y,

00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:14.500
then we can solve for x.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.100
In other words, if we know any two of the three variables in this equation,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.550
we can solve for the one that's missing.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.370
So, now let's revisit the factor model,

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.560
keeping in mind that we can think of the stock return,

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:31.899
the factor exposure, and the factor returned as three variables.

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:34.350
If we can calculate two of these,

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.925
then we can use regression to estimate the third variable that's missing.

00:00:38.924 --> 00:00:41.809
In the case of a time series risk model,

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.515
like the Fama-French example,

00:00:43.515 --> 00:00:46.969
we get the stock return in factor returns first.

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.259
So, we use regression to estimate the factor exposure Beta.

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:53.829
For a cross-sectional risk model,

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.744
we get the stock return and factor exposure Betas first.

00:00:57.744 --> 00:01:02.259
Then we use regression to estimate the factor return.

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:05.569
Again, this might take some getting used to,

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:07.699
because when we look at regression formulas,

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.260
we're probably used to seeing a letter y for the dependent variable,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.870
a letter x for the independent variable,

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.255
and a Greek letter Beta to represent the coefficient that we're estimating.

00:01:19.254 --> 00:01:23.774
Instead, we can shake things up and let our brains be more flexible.

00:01:23.775 --> 00:01:26.930
So, we'll think about what data is available as inputs for

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.020
the regression and what variables we don't have,

00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:32.469
and we'll estimate with regression.
