00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.765
Now let's look at the third factor, the value factor.

00:00:03.765 --> 00:00:08.279
There is research to suggest that stocks that have a high book value,

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:10.168
relative to their market price,

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:13.665
tends to outperform stocks with lower book value.

00:00:13.664 --> 00:00:17.849
Put another way, stocks that are cheap relative to their fundamentals,

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.850
tend to outperform stocks that are expensive,

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.710
relative to their fundamentals.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.425
Stocks with high fundamental valuations,

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:27.045
relative to market price,

00:00:27.045 --> 00:00:29.700
are often called value stocks.

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.939
Stocks with high market price,

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.844
relative to their fundamental valuations,

00:00:33.844 --> 00:00:36.365
are called growth stocks.

00:00:36.365 --> 00:00:38.960
Remember from the previous discussion of

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.249
the size factor that we can create a theoretical long/short portfolio

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:46.429
in order to express the hypothesis that value

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:50.530
indicates an additional boost and returns relative to growth.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.340
To do this, first,

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.785
sort the stocks in the estimation universe by their book-to-market value.

00:00:56.784 --> 00:00:59.814
Stocks with high book-to-market values,

00:00:59.814 --> 00:01:02.524
those that are above the 70th percentile,

00:01:02.524 --> 00:01:06.245
are grouped into a portfolio called value or high,

00:01:06.245 --> 00:01:10.100
where high refers to high book-to-market value.

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:13.019
Stocks with low book-to-market values,

00:01:13.019 --> 00:01:15.164
below the 30th percentile,

00:01:15.165 --> 00:01:19.200
are placed into a portfolio called growth or low,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.655
where low refers to low book-to-market value.

00:01:22.655 --> 00:01:28.430
Note that these percentile cutoffs are the ones used in the Fama-French model.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.970
Next, calculate the equal weighted return of

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:38.450
the value portfolio and equal weighted return of the growth portfolio.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.620
The long/short portfolio can be constructed by buying

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.935
the value portfolio and shorting an equal dollar amount of the growth portfolio.

00:01:47.935 --> 00:01:51.164
The daily returns of this long/short portfolio

00:01:51.164 --> 00:01:54.200
gives us the factor return of the value factor,

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.424
which we can now use in a factor model.

00:01:57.424 --> 00:01:59.539
In the Fama-French model,

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.890
the value factor is written as HML.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.760
This stands for High Minus Low,

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:12.000
where High refers to the value portfolio and Low refers to the growth portfolio.
