00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.165
Let's look at a few examples factors we can use with this cross-sectional risk model.

00:00:05.165 --> 00:00:08.640
There are categorical factors such as the country in which

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.190
the company is based or the sector that it is a part of.

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:15.419
Intuitively, we can imagine that the country of

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:18.875
a company may affect its stock price movement in some way.

00:00:18.875 --> 00:00:22.050
For instance, if a country's government added or

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.245
removed regulations that impacted only countries that

00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:28.310
operated in that country then the impact would be

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:32.609
concentrated on companies that are exposed to that country.

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:34.909
Similarly, it makes sense that

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:39.265
companies sector is a useful indicator about its stock price movements.

00:00:39.265 --> 00:00:42.804
For instance, if oil prices increased sharply,

00:00:42.804 --> 00:00:45.424
we can imagine this having a positive impact

00:00:45.424 --> 00:00:48.320
on the stock price of most companies that operate in

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.429
the oil and gas production sector but have a negative impact on

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:58.015
businesses that buy oil and gas products such as airlines or trucking companies.

00:00:58.015 --> 00:01:01.820
What you may notice about categorical variables such as country

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.609
or sector is that we can't sort categorical variables.

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:09.215
Sorting only makes sense if we have numerical data.

00:01:09.215 --> 00:01:13.155
Recall that if we were to try using a time series risk model,

00:01:13.155 --> 00:01:15.260
our first step would be to create

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.469
a theoretical portfolio whose daily returns represent the factor returns.

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:24.435
But to construct the theoretical portfolio representing the factor,

00:01:24.435 --> 00:01:27.140
we first need to sort the values so that

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.060
we can divide them into separate quantile groups.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.135
This isn't possible with categorical variables like a country or sector.

00:01:35.135 --> 00:01:39.505
Let's talk about how we normally handle categorical variables.

00:01:39.504 --> 00:01:43.924
You may have heard of dummy variables or one-hot encoding.

00:01:43.924 --> 00:01:48.539
If the country category has 12 unique countries for instance,

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.940
then we could expand the single country variable into

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:56.370
12 separate variables each representing one country.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.390
So, if a stock where in the USA,

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.599
it would have a value of one assigned to the USA

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:06.949
variable and zero for all other country variables.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.985
When we think in terms of the factor model,

00:02:09.985 --> 00:02:13.910
the value of one or zero that is assigned to each country

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:19.270
variable is the factor exposure for that stock to that country.
