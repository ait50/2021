00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.910
Let's focus on just one country variable,

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.849
such as the USA country variable and see how

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:09.365
we can estimate the values that will plug into the risk model.

00:00:09.365 --> 00:00:12.855
For the factor exposure matrix and its transpose,

00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:17.615
we want each stock's factor exposure to the USA country factor.

00:00:17.614 --> 00:00:19.509
This can be set to one,

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.625
if the company is based in the USA and zero if it's based in another country.

00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:28.829
You could also imagine choosing decimal values between zero and one

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:33.414
based on how much of the company's revenue is generated in the USA.

00:00:33.414 --> 00:00:38.905
In any case, the point is that we can estimate the values for the factor exposures.

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:43.685
Next, we want to fill in the co-variance matrix of factor returns.

00:00:43.685 --> 00:00:47.925
So, we want to obtain a time series of factor returns.

00:00:47.924 --> 00:00:49.899
To make it easier to follow,

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.449
I'm going to simplify our model so that it contains only one factor.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.440
So, the factor co-variance matrix contains

00:00:57.439 --> 00:01:02.403
just a single variants for the factor return of country USA.

00:01:02.404 --> 00:01:08.420
Also, the matrix of factor exposures has just one column for the single factor.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.450
The number of rows equals the number of stocks.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.745
We want to get the factor return,

00:01:14.745 --> 00:01:17.195
time series of the country USA,

00:01:17.194 --> 00:01:20.304
so that we can calculate a variance from it.

00:01:20.305 --> 00:01:24.770
The journey to estimating a time series starts with a single step.

00:01:24.769 --> 00:01:29.359
So, lets first estimate the factor return for a single time period.

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:33.019
Once we estimate the factor return for one time period,

00:01:33.019 --> 00:01:37.869
we can repeat the process to estimate factor returns for more time periods.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.265
Okay. We're going to estimate the factor return for a single day.

00:01:42.265 --> 00:01:45.814
So, we take a cross section by collecting data points

00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:49.923
for a single day but across multiple stocks.

00:01:49.924 --> 00:01:54.575
Each stock has a factor exposure associated with it.

00:01:54.575 --> 00:01:56.950
The factor exposure is one,

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.135
if the company is 100 percent exposed to country USA.

00:02:01.135 --> 00:02:03.535
The factor exposure is zero,

00:02:03.534 --> 00:02:07.914
if the stock is completely not exposed to the country USA.

00:02:07.915 --> 00:02:09.925
It's somewhere in between,

00:02:09.925 --> 00:02:12.395
if the stock is partly exposed to USA,

00:02:12.395 --> 00:02:14.705
but also to other countries.

00:02:14.705 --> 00:02:19.370
We'll also have the return for each stock on that time period.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.120
So, given the stock return and factor exposure,

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.900
we want to estimate the factor return.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.855
We have several data points,

00:02:27.854 --> 00:02:31.058
one for each stock in the stock universe.

00:02:31.058 --> 00:02:35.000
So, we can use a regression model to fit a line through

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.949
the plot of stock return versus factor exposure betas.

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:45.019
The slope of that line is the estimate for the factor return for that one time period.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.120
We can interpret this estimate of factor return as the amount of return that can

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.055
be attributed to being exposed to the risk factor of country USA.

00:02:56.055 --> 00:02:59.180
So, that was one factor return for

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.205
a single time period using a single cross-section of data.

00:03:03.205 --> 00:03:06.765
Yeah. We've now estimated one point.

00:03:06.764 --> 00:03:10.709
Remember that we want to find factor returns over time.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.885
If we repeat this cross-sectional regression for multiple time periods,

00:03:14.884 --> 00:03:18.259
we'd get a time series for the factor return.

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:23.114
That's great. If we calculate the variance of the factor return time series,

00:03:23.115 --> 00:03:27.810
we can plug it into the co-variance matrix of factor returns.
