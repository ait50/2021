00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.165
So, now we've seen how Fama and French used

00:00:03.165 --> 00:00:06.450
theoretical portfolios to create factor returns,

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.910
time series that represents size and value.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.535
What Fama and French did when combining these factors was to define

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:19.335
theoretical portfolios that were based on both size and value.

00:00:19.335 --> 00:00:21.580
Let's see what I mean by that,

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:24.699
first sort by market cap,

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:31.079
define the group of small stocks and also define the group of big stocks.

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.750
Then, for the small group,

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.189
sort by book to market value.

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:43.795
Divide this small group into three groups: value, neutral and growth.

00:00:43.795 --> 00:00:46.745
Do the same for the big group.

00:00:46.744 --> 00:00:49.134
Sort the stocks by market cap.

00:00:49.134 --> 00:00:51.500
Sort them by book to market value,

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.424
then divide them into three groups: value, neutral and growth.

00:00:57.424 --> 00:01:02.659
Now, we'll effectively have six portfolios which are six building blocks,

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:04.280
with which we'll use to construct

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.430
the long short portfolios representing the size and value factors.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.970
The small minus big size factor is the sum of

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:19.459
the three small portfolios minus the sum of the three big portfolios.

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:23.629
The high minus low value factor is the sum of

00:01:23.629 --> 00:01:28.549
two value portfolios minus the sum of two growth portfolios.

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:34.390
Notice that the two neutral portfolios aren't used in this formula.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.045
Okay, one more thing.

00:01:37.045 --> 00:01:40.355
Notice that small minus big was constructed using

00:01:40.355 --> 00:01:41.750
three building blocks for

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.775
the long position and three building blocks for the short position.

00:01:45.775 --> 00:01:49.295
However, high minus low was built using

00:01:49.295 --> 00:01:53.015
two building blocks for the loan and two for the short.

00:01:53.015 --> 00:01:56.969
Since we plan to use both factors in a multiple regression,

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.810
we want to even out the effects of each factor.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:06.715
So, we'll divide the small minus big by three and divide the high minus low by two.

00:02:06.715 --> 00:02:10.379
You can pause here to study these formulas.
