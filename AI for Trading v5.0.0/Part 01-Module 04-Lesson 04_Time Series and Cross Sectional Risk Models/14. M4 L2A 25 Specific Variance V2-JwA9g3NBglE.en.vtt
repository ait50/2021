00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
Now that we have the matrix of factor variances and covariances,

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.064
we also want to get values to fill in the matrix of

00:00:07.065 --> 00:00:13.324
specific variances which contain the variances of the specific returns for each stock.

00:00:13.324 --> 00:00:15.989
If there are two stocks in the stock universe,

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.929
then there are two specific risk variances to calculate.

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:24.219
Let's look at the specific risk variants of the first stock.

00:00:24.219 --> 00:00:26.839
The data to input into the variance is

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:30.960
a time series of the specific returns for the stock.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.424
The specific return is the residual or the difference from taking the stocks

00:00:36.424 --> 00:00:42.349
actual return minus the stocks estimated return using the chosen risk factors.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.390
So for each time period,

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.420
we have the actual stock return and can calculate

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.270
the estimated return based on the chosen risk factors.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.500
We can get the estimated return of the stock at

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.859
each time period by inputting values that we've already calculated.

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.250
The estimated return of the stock for

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.838
a single time period is a stock's factor exposure to country USA,

00:01:05.838 --> 00:01:10.614
multiplied by the factor return of USA for time t,

00:01:10.614 --> 00:01:15.829
plus the intercept term for time t. This is great.

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:20.424
Now we have one data point for the specific return of stock one.

00:01:20.424 --> 00:01:23.884
We can do the same thing for multiple time periods

00:01:23.885 --> 00:01:27.625
and get a time series for the specific return of the stock.

00:01:27.625 --> 00:01:31.099
The variance of this time series is the estimate that we

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:34.655
can use in the matrix of specific variances.

00:01:34.655 --> 00:01:42.299
So now we have all the pieces that go into the BFB transpose and S matrices.
