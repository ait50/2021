00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.290
Fundamental factors can also be used in the cross-sectional risk factor model.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.125
In fact we'll discuss two that we saw in the Fama-French time series model,

00:00:10.125 --> 00:00:13.265
the book to market value and market cap.

00:00:13.265 --> 00:00:16.679
This is an interesting example because we can see that

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:20.234
there are two approaches to working with the same factor.

00:00:20.234 --> 00:00:24.530
There's the method we saw using a time series risk factor model,

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.250
and now we'll see how to do this with the cross-sectional risk factor model.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.379
Just to revisit our goal,

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:35.710
we're going to fill in the values to calculate the portfolio variance.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.920
For starters, let's see what data we already have to work with.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.340
For each stock, we have a book to market value,

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.150
which may be updated once every three months if the company is based in the US.

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.469
We also have a market cap,

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:52.625
which may be updated daily.

00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:56.405
These values can be set as the factor exposures.

00:00:56.405 --> 00:00:59.625
Notice that in the Fama-French time series model,

00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:01.685
the book to market and market cap,

00:01:01.685 --> 00:01:06.829
were used in theoretical long-short portfolios to set the factor returns.

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:09.504
However, for the cross-sectional model,

00:01:09.504 --> 00:01:14.864
these values are used directly as the factor exposures instead.

00:01:14.864 --> 00:01:17.655
We can also obtain the stock returns,

00:01:17.655 --> 00:01:21.605
and we want to estimate the factor returns using regression.

00:01:21.605 --> 00:01:24.225
So, we'll take the following steps.

00:01:24.224 --> 00:01:27.244
For all the stocks in the selected stock universe,

00:01:27.245 --> 00:01:29.965
obtain each stock's factor exposures,

00:01:29.965 --> 00:01:33.295
which are the book to market value and market cap.

00:01:33.295 --> 00:01:38.465
Also get each stock's return for one time period.

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:43.820
Next, request the stock return against the factor exposures.

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:48.454
The regression estimates the factor return for each of the two factors.

00:01:48.454 --> 00:01:53.679
Since this factor return is estimated based on all the stocks in the stock universe,

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.205
it is general enough to apply to all those stocks.

00:01:57.204 --> 00:01:59.234
Notice that in practice,

00:01:59.234 --> 00:02:02.295
even if the stock universe is 9,000 stocks,

00:02:02.295 --> 00:02:06.590
we may use a subset of those stocks to perform the regression.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.400
This subset is called the estimation universe

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.760
because it's the stock universe that is used for estimating these model parameters.

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:19.280
To get a time series of factor returns,

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.974
repeat this process of performing a multiple regression for each day.

00:02:23.974 --> 00:02:27.739
Once we obtain a time series of factor returns,

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.170
we can calculate factor variances and

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:34.250
covariances to fill in the covariance matrix of factors.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.409
To fill in the matrix of specific variances,

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.835
we can calculate the specific return from the stock return

00:02:40.835 --> 00:02:45.340
minus the estimated stock return using the chosen factors.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.520
The variance of the specific return time series for each stock

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.400
is what we'll use to fill in the matrix of specific variances.
