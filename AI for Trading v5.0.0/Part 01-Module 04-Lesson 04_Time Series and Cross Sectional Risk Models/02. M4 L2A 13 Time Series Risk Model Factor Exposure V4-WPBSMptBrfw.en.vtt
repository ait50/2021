00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.285
To estimate the other variables,

00:00:02.285 --> 00:00:04.919
we'll also collect a time series of data for

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:08.804
each stock and make use of the capital asset pricing model.

00:00:08.804 --> 00:00:12.150
Remember that the capital asset pricing model assumes that

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.740
the stock's excess return above the risk-free rate can be modeled as

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:19.829
its exposure to the market's excess return above

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:25.959
the risk-free rate multiplied by the market's excess return above the risk-free rate.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.425
To make this discussion less wordy,

00:00:30.425 --> 00:00:33.200
I'll just say market's excess return when

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.530
referring to the market excess return above the risk-free rate.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.740
I'll also just say stock's excess return when

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.575
referring to the stock's excess return above the risk-free rate.

00:00:43.575 --> 00:00:46.640
Also, notice that the market exposure,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.160
which is what we've been calling this Beta variable when discussing the CAPM,

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:54.625
is called a factor exposure when we're discussing factor models.

00:00:54.625 --> 00:00:57.604
The term factor exposure is a more general term

00:00:57.604 --> 00:01:01.375
that describes any factor including the market factor.

00:01:01.375 --> 00:01:06.625
We're going to demonstrate one way to estimate factor exposures using regression.

00:01:06.625 --> 00:01:11.120
But keep in mind that factor exposure estimation is not a settled science.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.340
So, there are also other approaches to

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.930
estimating a stock's exposure to a particular factor.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.720
We'll get a time series of the market's excess return,

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:26.554
a time series of the first stock's excess return and run them through a regression.

00:01:26.555 --> 00:01:33.050
The coefficient Beta is an estimate of the first stock's exposure to this one factor.

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.849
We can do the same with a time series of the second stock's returns and

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:42.729
estimate the factor exposure of the second stock to this one factor.
