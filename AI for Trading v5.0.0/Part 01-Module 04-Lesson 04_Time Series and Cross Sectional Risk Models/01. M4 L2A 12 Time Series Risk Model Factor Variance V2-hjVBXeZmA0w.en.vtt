00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
So, you've seen the structure of the risk factor model and how it

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.070
attempts to explain a portfolio's risk in terms of the common risk factors.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.565
Let's see how this works with a factor that we've seen before,

00:00:11.564 --> 00:00:17.204
the market return which was introduced when discussing the capital asset pricing model.

00:00:17.204 --> 00:00:21.889
Our goal is to use the market return as a single factor in

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.289
our Risk Factor Model and then fill in

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.949
the values that we need to calculate the portfolio variance.

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.849
First, there is the covariance matrix of factors.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.719
Since there's only one factor,

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.409
it has one value which is the variance of

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:40.799
the market's excess return above the risk-free rate.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.030
To make our example more manageable,

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.325
we'll work with just two stocks.

00:00:46.325 --> 00:00:48.630
For the matrix of factor exposures,

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.745
we want the factor exposure of each stock to the single factor,

00:00:52.744 --> 00:00:54.989
which in our model, is the market return.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.660
So the factor exposure matrix is a column vector with two rows,

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:04.604
and the transpose is a row vector with two columns.

00:01:04.605 --> 00:01:10.245
We'll also fill in the matrix of specific returns for each stock.

00:01:10.245 --> 00:01:16.219
Let's see how we get the values that we'll put into the matrices of this risk model.

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:18.864
For the variance of the market factor,

00:01:18.864 --> 00:01:21.515
we can collect a time series of an index.

00:01:21.515 --> 00:01:27.474
For instance, the S and P 500 if the stock universe is focused on the US stock market.

00:01:27.474 --> 00:01:30.509
We can choose a time window of four weeks,

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.315
eight weeks, or 12 weeks.

00:01:32.314 --> 00:01:37.530
Then calculating the variance of this time series gives an estimate for this value.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.739
There's a bit of a judgement call as to what time window to use.

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:43.569
Too short of a sample,

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:45.634
and the data is mostly noise.

00:01:45.635 --> 00:01:47.420
Too long of a sample,

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.670
and the earlier data points may no longer be

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.950
useful for estimating the current variance of the market.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.140
Also, the time window used for analysis scales

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.420
with a holding period and the frequency at which we expect to trade.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.094
So, for daily trading,

00:02:03.094 --> 00:02:05.879
we may try different windows of several weeks.

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:08.590
For strategies with longer holding periods,

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.390
we may use a longer time window such as one,

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:13.584
two, or three years.

00:02:13.585 --> 00:02:17.730
So now we've estimated one value in the risk model.
