00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.069
It's important to be familiar with

00:00:02.069 --> 00:00:06.509
the cross-sectional approach as it's the one that most commercial risk models are based,

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.044
and commercial risk models are widely used by institutional investors.

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:16.535
In academic research, it's common to see the time series approach, whereas in industry,

00:00:16.535 --> 00:00:20.730
practitioners usually either purchase a commercial risk model such as

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.260
the ones built and maintained by MSCI Barra, Axioma,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.875
or Northfield, or they may use a third approach,

00:00:29.875 --> 00:00:34.855
principal component analysis, which we'll learn about in the next lesson.

00:00:34.854 --> 00:00:38.729
One challenge of constructing a risk model on your own is that you need

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:42.559
to decide for yourself which risk factors to use in the model,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.420
and don't have an easy way to enforce

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.969
the assumption that the factors are independent of each other,

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.504
or that the specific returns of the stocks are independent of each other as well.

00:00:53.505 --> 00:00:57.620
Commercial risk models can be purchased off the shelf so that

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:02.369
institutional investors can focus their attention on researching Alpha factors.

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:05.159
The machine-learning approach with PCA,

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.719
which we'll learn in the next lesson,

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:09.905
is nice because it derives latent factors which

00:01:09.905 --> 00:01:13.460
are by definition explaining the most variance in

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:16.608
the distribution of returns while also enforcing

00:01:16.608 --> 00:01:21.039
that each latent factor is independent of all the others.
