00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.990
Now, let's see how we can use

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:07.205
the Fama French three-factor model to fill in the values we need for the risk model.

00:00:07.205 --> 00:00:09.185
We have three factors,

00:00:09.185 --> 00:00:13.920
so we'll fill in the covariance matrix of factors that is three by three.

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:18.439
Notice that the first row has the market factor in all three columns,

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.115
the second row has the size factor,

00:00:21.114 --> 00:00:24.154
and the third row has the value factor.

00:00:24.155 --> 00:00:27.750
We want time series of three factor returns;

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.714
market, size, and value.

00:00:30.714 --> 00:00:38.064
The market factor can be the excess return of a market index such as the S&amp;P 500.

00:00:38.064 --> 00:00:43.045
The size factor is the return of a theoretical portfolio that long,

00:00:43.045 --> 00:00:46.380
small stocks and shorts, big stocks.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:53.219
So, it's going along the three small portfolios and shorting the three big portfolios.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.119
The value factor is the return of

00:00:56.119 --> 00:01:01.424
the theoretical portfolio that longs value stocks and shorts growth stocks.

00:01:01.424 --> 00:01:07.170
So, it's going long two value portfolios and shorting two growth portfolios.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.829
You can pause here to study these formulas before continuing.

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:15.709
Now, let's look at the matrix of factor exposures.

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:18.319
We'll assume just two stocks.

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:23.154
Each stock has a factor exposure for each of the three factors.

00:01:23.155 --> 00:01:27.400
The transpose of the factor exposure matrix looks similar,

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.005
just turned on its side.

00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:33.655
To estimate factor exposures for the first stock,

00:01:33.655 --> 00:01:35.335
we can use regression,

00:01:35.334 --> 00:01:38.069
this time a multiple regression.

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:39.875
For the first stock,

00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:41.849
the regression looks like this.

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:47.129
The independent variables are the factor returns for the market, size, and value.

00:01:47.129 --> 00:01:52.054
The dependent variable is the return of the first stock.

00:01:52.055 --> 00:01:58.260
The same procedure can be used to estimate the factor exposure for stock two.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.240
The specific variance matrix holds the variance for

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:06.184
each stock that is not attributable to these factors.

00:02:06.185 --> 00:02:09.155
For the specific variants of the first stock,

00:02:09.155 --> 00:02:13.039
let's first get a time series of the specific return.

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:15.739
The specific return for each day is

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.530
the actual return of the stock minus is estimated return.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.900
The estimated return is calculated using

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.675
the factor returns and factor exposures that we calculated earlier.

00:02:28.675 --> 00:02:32.075
We can do the same for the second stock.

00:02:32.074 --> 00:02:36.049
Taking the variance of the specific returns gives us

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.895
the values that we can put in the matrix of specific variances.

00:02:39.895 --> 00:02:43.425
You can pause here to study the formulas a bit.

00:02:43.425 --> 00:02:48.380
So, we did it. We have all the pieces that go into the factor model of

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.479
portfolio variance and we estimated

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:53.924
these values using the Fama French three-factor model.

00:02:53.925 --> 00:02:59.010
Just a reminder that this approach is called a Time Series Risk Model.

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:02.539
Next, we'll look at another common type of risk model,

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:05.469
which is the cross-sectional risk model.
