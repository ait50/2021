00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.275
Once we have our text ready in a clean and normalized form,

00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:08.009
we need to transform it into features that can be used for modeling.

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:10.830
For instance, treating each document like a bag of

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.155
words allows us to compute some simple statistics that characterize it.

00:00:15.154 --> 00:00:17.519
These statistics can be improved by assigning

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:21.744
appropriate weights towards using a TF-IDF Scheme.

00:00:21.745 --> 00:00:25.050
This enables a more accurate comparison between documents.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.510
For certain applications, we may need to find

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.645
numerical representations of individual words,

00:00:30.644 --> 00:00:33.405
and for that, we can use word embeddings,

00:00:33.405 --> 00:00:36.240
which are a very efficient and powerful method.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.219
In this lesson, you will learn

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.000
all these techniques for extracting relevant features from text data.
