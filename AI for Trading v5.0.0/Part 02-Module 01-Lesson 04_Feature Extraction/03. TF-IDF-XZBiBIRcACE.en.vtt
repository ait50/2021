00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
One limitation of the bag-of-words approach is

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.509
that it treats every word as being equally important,

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.640
whereas intuitively, we know that some words occur frequently within a corpus.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.655
For example, when looking at financial documents,

00:00:14.654 --> 00:00:17.684
cost or price may be a pretty common term.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:23.146
We can compensate for this by counting the number of documents in which each word occurs,

00:00:23.146 --> 00:00:25.269
this can be called document frequency,

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:30.714
and then dividing the term frequencies by the document frequency of that term.

00:00:30.714 --> 00:00:33.030
This gives us a metric that is proportional to

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.804
the frequency of occurrence of a term in a document,

00:00:35.804 --> 00:00:40.024
but inversely proportional to the number of documents it appears in.

00:00:40.024 --> 00:00:43.754
It highlights the words that are more unique to a document,

00:00:43.755 --> 00:00:46.484
and thus better for characterizing it.

00:00:46.484 --> 00:00:48.719
You may have heard of, or used,

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.185
the TF-IDF transform before.

00:00:51.185 --> 00:00:53.475
It's simply the product of two words,

00:00:53.475 --> 00:00:55.810
very similar to what we've seen so far,

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.094
a term frequency and an inverse document frequency.

00:01:00.094 --> 00:01:06.638
The most commonly used form of TF-IDF defines term frequency as the raw count of a term,

00:01:06.638 --> 00:01:08.530
t, in a document, d,

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.530
divided by the total number of terms in d,

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.129
and inverse document frequency as

00:01:14.129 --> 00:01:18.220
the logarithm of the total number of documents in the collection,

00:01:18.221 --> 00:01:22.385
d, divided by the number of documents where t is present.

00:01:22.385 --> 00:01:25.410
Several variations exist that try to normalize,

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.224
or smooth the resulting values,

00:01:27.224 --> 00:01:30.909
or prevent edge cases such as divide-by-zero errors.

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.229
Overall, TF-IDF is an innovative approach to assigning

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.000
weights to words that signify their relevance in documents.
