00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.585
One-hot encoding usually works in some situations

00:00:03.585 --> 00:00:07.075
but breaks down when we have a large vocabulary to deal with,

00:00:07.075 --> 00:00:11.879
because the size of our ward representation grows with the number of words.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.460
What we need as a way to control the size of

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.089
our word representation by limiting it to a fixed-size vector.

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:22.440
In other words, we want to find an embedding for each word in

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.620
some vector space and we wanted to exhibit some desired properties.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.460
For example, if two words are similar in meaning,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.719
they should be closer to each other compared to words that are not.

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.304
And if two pairs of words have a similar difference in their meanings,

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:42.905
they should be approximately equally separated in the embedded space.

00:00:42.905 --> 00:00:45.870
We could use such a representation for a variety of

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:49.019
purposes like finding synonyms and analogies,

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.095
identifying concepts around which words are clustered,

00:00:52.094 --> 00:00:54.060
classifying words as positive,

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.890
negative, neutral, et cetera.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.780
By combining word vectors,

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.259
we can come up with another way of representing documents as well.
