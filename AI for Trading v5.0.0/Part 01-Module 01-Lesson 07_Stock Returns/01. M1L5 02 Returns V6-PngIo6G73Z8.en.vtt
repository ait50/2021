00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.585
Say we're looking at a time series of prices for a stock.

00:00:03.585 --> 00:00:06.000
The ups and downs are interesting if we're

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.550
vaguely curious about how the company is doing.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.070
But more likely than not,

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.269
we're looking at the price series because we own some of

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.289
the stock or we've invested money in the stock on someone else's behalf.

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.004
What we care about is how our investment has increased or decreased in value.

00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:23.774
So, how do we measure that increase or decrease?

00:00:23.774 --> 00:00:28.479
There are actually several metrics we might use to quantify changes in price over time.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.435
One is the simple difference in price.

00:00:31.434 --> 00:00:34.504
P_t minus P_t minus one.

00:00:34.505 --> 00:00:37.505
This might represent the difference between the price of a stock

00:00:37.505 --> 00:00:40.695
this month and it's price one month ago for example.

00:00:40.695 --> 00:00:45.115
Another is the percentage return or raw return.

00:00:45.115 --> 00:00:48.685
This is the difference divided by the starting price,

00:00:48.685 --> 00:00:53.165
P_t minus P_t minus one divided by P_t minus one.

00:00:53.164 --> 00:00:59.475
Imagine you bought a $1,000 of stock one month ago and sold it this month for $1050.

00:00:59.475 --> 00:01:01.850
Your return on your initial investment of

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.025
$50 is five percent of your original investment.

00:01:05.025 --> 00:01:10.685
If you buy $5,000 of stock this month and sell it for $5,300 next month,

00:01:10.685 --> 00:01:15.325
you might want to compare the success of this new investment to the previous one.

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:18.075
Instead of comparing $300 to $50,

00:01:18.075 --> 00:01:21.030
you can calculate the return and compare six percent to

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.579
five percent to see that as a proportion of your original investment.

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:27.060
You did slightly better with the second investment.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.055
That's the advantage of using returns.

00:01:29.055 --> 00:01:31.965
Prices are normalized and thus similar in scale.

00:01:31.965 --> 00:01:36.469
This is actually a requirement for many statistical and machine learning techniques.
