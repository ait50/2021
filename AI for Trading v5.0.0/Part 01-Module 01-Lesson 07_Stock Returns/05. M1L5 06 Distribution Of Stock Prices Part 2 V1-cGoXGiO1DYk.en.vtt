00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
Let's talk about how a series of daily price values arises.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.884
It has to do with our earlier discussion of compounding.

00:00:06.884 --> 00:00:09.839
Let's say, a stock starts at P sub zero,

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:13.949
and each day the price changes by some small percent, the return.

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:17.579
We saw earlier how the price at time T could be written

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:21.394
as a product of all of these one plus little r sub i terms.

00:00:21.394 --> 00:00:27.155
Remember, one plus little r equals P sub t divided by P sub t minus one.

00:00:27.155 --> 00:00:29.875
If we take the log of both sides of this equation,

00:00:29.875 --> 00:00:32.840
we get log of P sub t on one side and

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.040
a sum of log of one plus little r sub i terms on the other side.

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:42.884
Here, for convenience, I'm going to move log of P sub zero back to the left-hand side.

00:00:42.884 --> 00:00:45.250
Remember, P sub zero is a constant,

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.000
it's not dependent on time.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.284
Now, we're going to use the central limit theorem.

00:00:50.284 --> 00:00:54.164
You might remember the central limit theorem from a class on probability,

00:00:54.164 --> 00:00:56.859
but if you don't I'll just explain it briefly here.

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:00.049
It says that, the sum of random variables that

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:03.019
have the same distribution and are not dependent on each

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.290
other approaches a normal distribution and

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.490
the limit that the number of random variables and the sum goes to infinity.

00:01:10.489 --> 00:01:14.209
So, let's make the assumption that the returns on each day are independent,

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:16.875
but come from the same underlying distribution.

00:01:16.875 --> 00:01:21.515
This seems reasonable certainly more reasonable for returns and for prices.

00:01:21.515 --> 00:01:23.900
After all, the price of a stock on one day

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.575
almost certainly depends on its price the day before.

00:01:26.575 --> 00:01:28.495
So, if we make that assumption,

00:01:28.495 --> 00:01:30.725
we can see that the right hand side,

00:01:30.724 --> 00:01:35.209
the wholesome is a random variable that follows a normal distribution.

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:41.979
So, we have that log of P sub t minus log of P sub zero is distributed normally.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.549
But if P sub 0 is a constant,

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.795
then log of P sub t is also distributed normally,

00:01:47.795 --> 00:01:50.600
because a normally distributed random variable minus

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:53.049
the constant is still normally distributed.

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.489
Now, I'm going to tell you about a new distribution called the log-normal distribution.

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:03.259
Guess what, it looks kind of like that right-skewed distribution we talked about earlier.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.000
What you need to know about the log normal distribution is that if Y is

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.034
distributed normally then e to the y is distributed log normally.

00:02:11.034 --> 00:02:14.109
I'll say that again, if Y is distributed normally,

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.995
then e to the y is distributed log normally.

00:02:16.995 --> 00:02:20.620
So, if log of P sub t is distributed normally,

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:27.175
then P sub t which equals e to the log of P sub t is distributed log normally.

00:02:27.175 --> 00:02:32.730
In fact, prices are frequently assumed to arise from a log normal distribution.

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:36.019
This seems reasonable from just eyeballing the distribution

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.640
because we can see that it doesn't go below zero and it's skewed to the right.

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:42.839
Those properties match our actual price distribution well.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.405
However, when working with real data,

00:02:45.405 --> 00:02:48.469
the assumption that prices are distributed log normally,

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:50.319
may or may not be a good one.

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.060
These distributions can be convenient models,

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.479
but don't confuse them with actual distributions of stock prices or returns.
