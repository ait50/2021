00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.089
Quantitative analysts frequently work with a quantity

00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:05.769
related to but slightly different from the raw return,

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:08.279
the natural logarithm of return.

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:10.769
Remember how the return was defined as

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.890
P sub t minus P sub t minus one divided by P sub t minus 1.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.875
Well, the log return is defined slightly differently,

00:00:17.875 --> 00:00:22.254
as the natural logarithm of P sub t divided by P sub t minus one.

00:00:22.254 --> 00:00:24.980
To see how to convert between these two quantities,

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:31.109
note that if we add one to P sub t minus P sub t minus one divided by P sub t minus one,

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.240
we can convert one to P sub t minus one,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.070
divided by P sub t minus one,

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.115
and the expression simplifies to P sub t divided by P sub t minus one.

00:00:41.115 --> 00:00:44.310
So, if we denote the log return as capital R,

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.359
and the raw return as little r,

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:49.609
then capital R equals the log of little r plus

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.810
one and little r equals e to the capital R minus one.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.435
Why the quantitative analysts use log returns?

00:00:56.435 --> 00:01:00.560
Well, it turns out that log returns have a number of appealing properties.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.300
Instead of listing them all now,

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:04.250
we're going to highlight them as they arise while we

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.775
talk about the remaining content in this lesson.

00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:09.685
For one thing, if the value of R is small,

00:01:09.685 --> 00:01:11.025
or much less than one,

00:01:11.025 --> 00:01:14.135
then the natural log of one plus r approximately equals

00:01:14.135 --> 00:01:18.050
r. Since returns are typically small percentages,

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.000
the values of log returns are typically close to the values of returns.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.094
To understand this intuitively,

00:01:24.094 --> 00:01:27.349
take a look at the graph of the natural log of x plus one,

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:29.369
it goes through the point 00,

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.025
and it has a slope of one there,

00:01:31.025 --> 00:01:34.495
so at 00 it's tangent to the line y equals x.

00:01:34.495 --> 00:01:38.590
If we were to zoom into a tiny neighborhood around x equals 0,

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.969
the two lines practically overlie each other,

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:44.409
so the natural log of x plus one approximately equals X.

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.530
That's all that equation is saying.
