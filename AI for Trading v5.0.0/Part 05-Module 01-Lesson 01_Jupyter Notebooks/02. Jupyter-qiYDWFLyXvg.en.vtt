00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.890
Now I'm going to introduce you to

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.410
Jupyter notebooks. Notebooks are an amazing

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.720
tool for data analysis, where text, code,

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.820
and images all sit in one document in your

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:09.840
browser.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.969
Here's an example notebook where I

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.130
explored predicting body fat percentage

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.400
with various regression models. Up top

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.980
here you see what's called a text cell.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.020
Cells are these guys and they can contain text

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.199
or code. If I double-click on the text

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.390
cell, I can edit the text in here. It's

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.400
written in markdown, a text format with

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.090
syntax that renders to HTML. So for instance,

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.820
if I want to write a link, this is the

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.040
syntax for it, and if I render the

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.649
text, it's a link. This is a code cell.

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.020
You can see here I'm importing some

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.629
packages like Numpy and Pandas. I can run

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.610
this cell and the code is executed the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.680
same way as it is in the terminal or a

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.989
Python script. This command here

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.899
"%matplotlib inline" will render images

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.879
generated with matplotlib in the

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.739
notebook instead of a separate window.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.140
If the cell returns some output, you see here.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.799
For instance, data. head() returns an HTML

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.600
table displaying some of the data. Right

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.729
below here you see the data visualized

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.229
with a grid of scatter plots and

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.799
histograms. Notebooks even render math in

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:26.759
a text cells.

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.500
This is just an example of what you can

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.479
do with notebooks. You have your code,

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.630
documentation, visualizations, math, all in

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.560
one place.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.570
Next, I'll show you how to use notebooks

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.610
in your workflow. It should take about an

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.350
hour to get through the lesson, so see

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.009
you in the classroom!
