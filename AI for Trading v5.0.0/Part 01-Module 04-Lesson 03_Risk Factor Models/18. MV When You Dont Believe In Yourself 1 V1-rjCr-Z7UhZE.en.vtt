00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
In my conversations with Udacity students over the years,

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.230
something I've heard again and again is that people switching career tracks or even

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.550
just acquainting themselves with new fields can experience issues with self-confidence.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.460
They often doubt that they've developed sword expertise,

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.200
feel like they don't belong in their new line of

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.990
work and attribute success they experience to luck,

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.000
rather than their own effort and progress.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.810
It's like their sense of identity hasn't yet caught up with the growth they've undergone,

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.790
this is called impostor syndrome.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.670
The good news is that it's super normal to feel this way,

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.235
and it's something you can work through if you experience it.

00:00:32.235 --> 00:00:33.990
So true.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.000
I taught a coding bootcamp before and nearly every one of my students admitted to

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.169
me at some point that they couldn't imagine doing data science for a living,

00:00:42.169 --> 00:00:44.585
or getting a job in the field that they really wanted.

00:00:44.585 --> 00:00:47.885
One of my students made beautiful map visualizations

00:00:47.885 --> 00:00:51.520
and still insisted that he couldn't imagine himself getting a job.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.715
Another one of my students wrote efficient, well-documented code,

00:00:55.715 --> 00:00:58.070
but she still told me that she felt like she had to work a

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.440
lot harder to prove herself because she didn't

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.025
have the right background or the right credentials from the right university.

00:01:06.025 --> 00:01:08.180
How about you Eddie? You've done a ton of

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.505
online learning and you've switched fields yourself.

00:01:10.505 --> 00:01:12.575
Have you ever felt something like this before?

00:01:12.575 --> 00:01:14.990
Yeah, definitely. I felt it too,

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.450
when I enrolled in my first Udacity Nanodegree program friends would ask me,

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.630
"What's new with you or what are you up to these days?"

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.925
I would get pretty self-conscious and mumble something like,

00:01:25.925 --> 00:01:30.170
"Well, I'm studying something online, some data stuff."

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.615
Then they would stare at the floor before changing the subject to,

00:01:33.615 --> 00:01:35.670
"Enough about me, how about you?"

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.850
Oh my gosh. Yeah, impostor syndrome is a really,

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.335
really tricky problem to handle.

00:01:39.335 --> 00:01:41.960
If someone tells you, "Just believe in yourself," that may

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.720
not necessarily help because the question is how,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.635
how do you shake the voices inside your head and build up your own confidence?

00:01:48.635 --> 00:01:52.340
For me, what helped me handle the self-doubt was to

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.440
put that question aside and instead ask myself some different questions.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.960
If I somehow knew that in the future I was going

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.410
to be in my ideal job doing cool things for work,

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.515
what would I be doing these next six months,

00:02:06.515 --> 00:02:09.265
one year, and two years to get there?

00:02:09.265 --> 00:02:11.820
As a follow-up question I would ask myself,

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.400
what would I be doing today?

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.520
Yeah, that sounds helpful in getting yourself comfortable with trying

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.540
new things and going after your goals even if they seem out of reach right now.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.195
I've also battled some really intense impostor syndrome,

00:02:23.195 --> 00:02:25.370
as a woman in physics, a self-taught programmer

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.805
and an educator with a nontraditional background.

00:02:27.805 --> 00:02:30.500
Wow. How did you find ways to deal with that?

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.435
I still struggle with it sometimes,

00:02:32.435 --> 00:02:35.990
sometimes daily, but I found some strategies useful when trying to combat it.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.735
For example, if I'm feeling like a fraud in my work,

00:02:38.735 --> 00:02:42.230
I'll try to imagine how I might respond if someone else other than

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.280
me with the same skill set was doubting themselves in the way that I do.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.365
Yeah, I can imagine we're usually harder on ourselves and more forgiving of others.

00:02:51.365 --> 00:02:51.875
Definitely.

00:02:51.875 --> 00:02:55.980
So it helps to think of how we treat someone else who was in our same position.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.835
Totally. Similar to what you were saying, I've worked really,

00:02:58.835 --> 00:03:01.774
really hard to become more comfortable with risk-taking,

00:03:01.774 --> 00:03:04.705
receiving feedback, and just putting myself out there.

00:03:04.705 --> 00:03:09.050
Pushing myself outside my comfort zone this way felt totally terrifying at first,

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.110
I made it more palatable by reminding myself of a few things.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.145
Number one, my belief that I can't succeed is not objective reality,

00:03:16.145 --> 00:03:18.800
it's just a thought that I can make fade over time.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.120
Number two, my brain and everyone else's brains are capable of

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.550
unbounded growth and feeling challenged often indicates that I am making progress.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.010
Number three, my career development and the impact I want to have through

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.610
my work are way more important than a bit of discomfort on my end.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.240
So reconnecting with my own goals puts all of this in context.
