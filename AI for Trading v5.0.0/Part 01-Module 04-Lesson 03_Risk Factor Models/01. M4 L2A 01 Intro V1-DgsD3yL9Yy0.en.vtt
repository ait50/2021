00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.169
Hi there. So far,

00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:04.109
you've been introduced to the concept of

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.640
a factor and the framework of the multifactor model.

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:11.730
We've also touched upon how in practice we defined some factors

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.625
as risk factors and other factors as alpha factors.

00:00:16.625 --> 00:00:19.050
In this lesson, we will focus on

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.890
risk factors and the fundamentals of the risk factor model.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.630
Risk factor models are used to describe the volatility or risk of

00:00:27.629 --> 00:00:32.515
assets such as stocks based on the movements of the risk factors.

00:00:32.515 --> 00:00:36.240
The goal of a risk factor model is to measure,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:43.280
control and possibly neutralize a portfolio's exposure to major sources of risk.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.450
In order to achieve this goal,

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.234
we need a way to model the portfolio's risk in terms of the common risk factors.

00:00:51.234 --> 00:00:53.579
To model a portfolio's risk,

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.839
we want to model individual asset variances and

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.630
pairwise asset covariances in terms of these risk factors.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.475
To model asset variance and covariance in terms of risk factors,

00:01:06.474 --> 00:01:09.504
we need a couple pieces of information;

00:01:09.504 --> 00:01:14.119
the variances and covariances of risk factors,

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:21.550
the factor exposures which measure how exposed each asset is to each risk factor,

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:28.409
and the specific variance of each asset that is not explained by the risk factors.

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.829
To calculate the variances and covariances of the risk factors,

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:39.590
we also need to calculate the returns of the factors which are called the factor returns.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.469
We'll also make use of the asset returns which will help us either estimate

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:50.914
the factor exposures or the factor returns depending on the type of risk model.

00:01:50.915 --> 00:01:54.190
We can then use these pieces of information to

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.605
estimate the specific variants of each asset.

00:01:57.605 --> 00:02:03.350
To start off, we also should decide what factors we'll use in our model.

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:07.530
By the way, don't worry if these terms don't look familiar yet,

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.229
you'll see a couple of ways of getting all the pieces that go into a risk model.

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:13.810
So along the way,

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.935
you'll see what these words mean.

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:19.735
We'll begin with the motivation for using risk factor models.

00:02:19.735 --> 00:02:22.280
Factor models have some benefits over

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.995
modelling portfolio risk directly from the covariances of its individual assets.

00:02:27.995 --> 00:02:32.224
Next, we will cover the framework for the risk factor model.

00:02:32.224 --> 00:02:35.239
The risk factor model attempts to explain the variance of

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.340
a portfolio as the sum of two parts;

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.729
the variance that can be attributed to

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:47.185
the common risk factors plus variance that is not explained by those risk factors.

00:02:47.185 --> 00:02:51.770
I just want to point out that risk factor modeling combined with

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.975
alpha factor modeling are both crucial to successful portfolio optimization.

00:02:56.974 --> 00:03:01.879
Just as a car needs both a brake pedal and an accelerator or

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:07.125
a good basketball team needs both a good defense and also a good offense.

00:03:07.125 --> 00:03:12.995
An effectively optimized portfolio needs to both control risk using risk factors,

00:03:12.995 --> 00:03:17.879
while seeking higher than expected returns using alpha factors.
