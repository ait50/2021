00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
To get us ready to look at the risk factor model,

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.509
let's review the factor model of returns.

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.205
Note that some of this may look familiar from an earlier lesson, which is great.

00:00:11.205 --> 00:00:14.370
Our team is really excited about what you'll be able

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:17.489
to do by the time you get to this next project.

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:19.529
But we also recognize that it's

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.890
a pretty steep climb to reach the top of the mountain of knowledge.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.670
So, we're trying to guide you up the mountain as gently as possible.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.325
Let's begin by looking at a factor model of return.

00:00:32.325 --> 00:00:35.975
For a single stock and a single factor,

00:00:35.975 --> 00:00:39.770
the return of a stock can be modeled as the sum of

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:46.155
two parts: the factor contribution to return plus the specific return.

00:00:46.155 --> 00:00:51.435
The contribution of the factors is also called the common return.

00:00:51.435 --> 00:00:57.560
The common return is defined as the stock's exposure to that factor times the rate of

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.530
return of the factor is the part of

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.635
the stock's return that can be explained by the factor.

00:01:04.635 --> 00:01:11.405
The stock's exposure to the factor has a couple commonly used names: factor exposure,

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:16.204
factor loading, factor sensitivity, or factor beta.

00:01:16.204 --> 00:01:20.289
We'll refer to this as the factor exposure.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:26.080
The rate of return of the factor is the percent change of a particular factor.

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:29.295
We'll call this the factor return.

00:01:29.295 --> 00:01:33.890
An example of a factor that we've seen before is the market return,

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.905
as approximated by an index such as the S&amp;P 500.

00:01:38.905 --> 00:01:43.655
The other contributor to the stock return is the specific return

00:01:43.655 --> 00:01:48.460
which is the return of the stock that is not explained by the factors in the model.

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:54.914
This may also be referred to as the idiosyncratic return or idiosyncratic shock.

00:01:54.915 --> 00:01:58.090
We'll call this the specific return.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.234
So, to summarize, the stock return equals

00:02:01.234 --> 00:02:07.375
the factor exposure times the factor return plus the specific return.

00:02:07.375 --> 00:02:12.675
A model can have multiple factors contributing to the return of the stock.

00:02:12.675 --> 00:02:16.713
So, for instance, the return can be modeled as the contribution

00:02:16.713 --> 00:02:20.789
of one factor plus the contribution of a second factor.

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:24.650
As before, the specific return represents the part of

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.000
the stock return that isn't explained by the chosen factors.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.074
In general, we can choose any number of factors in order to model stock's return.

00:02:35.074 --> 00:02:39.524
We can refer to this as a multi-factor model of returns.

00:02:39.525 --> 00:02:43.705
Cool. So, that was how we model the return of a single stock,

00:02:43.705 --> 00:02:45.230
but as you may guess,

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:48.769
we're going to be more interested in a portfolio of stocks.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.130
Let's see how factor models describe a portfolio of stocks next.
