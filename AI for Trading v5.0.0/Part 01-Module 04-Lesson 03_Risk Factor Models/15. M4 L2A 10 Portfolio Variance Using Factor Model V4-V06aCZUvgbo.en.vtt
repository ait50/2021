00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
Let's finish the last step and include

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.330
the portfolio weights to get the portfolio variance.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.280
The formula for the variance of

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.180
this two stock portfolio uses the weights for each stock to

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.940
calculate the portfolio's variance in terms of

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.540
the variances and covariances of the stocks.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.720
Recall that we have formulas that express each of

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.670
these asset variances and covariances in terms of the risk factors.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.335
If we substituted these values into the equation for portfolio variance,

00:00:31.335 --> 00:00:36.135
this would be the model of portfolio variance in terms of the risk factors.

00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:40.170
In other words, it's a risk factor model.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.240
Notice that this is equivalent to the formula we saw earlier,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.475
which is in matrix notation.

00:00:46.475 --> 00:00:51.165
Let's see why. The covariance matrix

00:00:51.165 --> 00:00:55.985
of the factors contains the variances and covariances of the factors.

00:00:55.985 --> 00:00:59.240
Recall on the ice cream analogy that we can think of these

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.360
as the sugar and milk or the main ingredients of ice cream.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.015
The matrix of factor exposures looks like this.

00:01:08.015 --> 00:01:11.660
In our analogy, these like are the measuring spoons of

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.050
different sizes for each ingredient depending on the stock.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.990
Also, here's the matrix of specific variances.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.680
In the ice cream analogy,

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.940
these are the pecans and chocolate chips,

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.795
since these are ingredients that are specific to each flavor of ice cream,

00:01:28.795 --> 00:01:31.310
but not common to both.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.870
Finally, we have the vector of portfolio weights.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.720
Since the portfolio weights define how much of each stock to put in the portfolio,

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.700
these are like the ice cream scoops,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.330
which decide how much of each ice cream flavor to put in our bowl.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.714
If we worked through the matrix multiplications and additions,

00:01:51.714 --> 00:01:53.530
we'd end up with a single value,

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.615
which is the portfolio variance.

00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:58.390
So I'm hoping that you now feel more familiar with

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.744
this formula for this factor model covariance.

00:02:01.744 --> 00:02:04.235
Since there are lots of variables,

00:02:04.235 --> 00:02:08.285
you can think of the ice cream analogy if it helps you keep track of everything.

00:02:08.285 --> 00:02:12.275
Feel free to pause here to study this formula in more detail,

00:02:12.275 --> 00:02:15.265
or if you like looking at ice cream.

00:02:15.265 --> 00:02:19.070
If you want to walk through the math to solidify your learning,

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.790
I recommend calculating the matrix multiplications and also doing

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.100
the math using the non-matrix notation to see that you get the same result.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.985
To do these calculations,

00:02:28.985 --> 00:02:34.040
I recommend some tools that I found very helpful when studying math and machine learning.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.084
Since we live in the age of smart phones and computers,

00:02:37.084 --> 00:02:39.020
you may not have seen these tools in a while,

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.430
so I'll introduce them here.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.815
This is a pencil and this is paper.

00:02:44.815 --> 00:02:48.305
These are both very useful tools when studying math and machine learning,

00:02:48.305 --> 00:02:52.980
so I encourage you to use them when you're studying. Cheers.
