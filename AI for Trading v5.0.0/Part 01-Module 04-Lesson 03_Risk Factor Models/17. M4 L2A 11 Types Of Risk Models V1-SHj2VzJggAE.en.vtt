00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.910
Coming up, we'll cover major flavors of the risk model.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.850
We'll start with a risk model that uses a single risk factor, the market return.

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.414
This is the capital asset pricing model which you've learned earlier.

00:00:12.414 --> 00:00:16.839
Then, we'll build on this to learn about the Fama French three factor model.

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:20.969
The Fama French model which was proposed by Eugene Fama and

00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:26.489
Kenneth French is the basis for the movement towards the multifactor model of assets.

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:31.344
In fact, many papers that study or propose potential alpha factors,

00:00:31.344 --> 00:00:36.159
can trace some of their methodology to the Fama-French three factor model.

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:39.379
The cap m and Fama French three factor model are

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.980
both examples of time series risk models.

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:46.399
We'll then introduce a cross-sectional risk model and

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.015
see how they're different from time series risk models.

00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:51.689
In a later lesson,

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:54.979
we'll also introduce a model of Leighton risk factors using

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:59.034
a kind of unsupervised machine learning principle component analysis.

00:00:59.034 --> 00:01:03.379
In quanta investing, you may come across all three types of risk models,

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.635
times series, cross sectional or PCA.

00:01:06.635 --> 00:01:09.079
So, it helps to understand each one.

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:12.890
You will use the PCA risk model in this next project and we'll

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.040
use one of the time series models in term two of this program.
