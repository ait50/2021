00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.339
Let's clean up the formulas a bit.

00:00:02.339 --> 00:00:07.905
We can move the constant factor exposures outside of the covariance operators.

00:00:07.905 --> 00:00:14.550
Also, the covariance of a factor with itself is also called the variance of that factor.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.875
So, the expressions now look like this.

00:00:17.875 --> 00:00:20.640
So, to summarize, we can express

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.125
the pairwise covariance of two stocks as a sum of four terms,

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:28.509
written in terms of the two factors.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.270
Now we have the variance of the first stock,

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.285
the variance of the second stock,

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:38.488
and their covariances written in terms of the two factors.

00:00:38.488 --> 00:00:40.390
So, that's pretty great,

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.304
because we actually have the pieces we need to fill in a covariance matrix of assets.

00:00:45.304 --> 00:00:48.829
Recall that another way to get these four values is to use

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.534
a time series of the stocks to calculate the variances and covariances.

00:00:53.534 --> 00:00:55.279
But as we mentioned earlier,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.245
this approach doesn't scale well when handling thousands of stocks.

00:00:59.244 --> 00:01:02.140
So, instead, we have modeled the covariance matrix

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.340
of assets in terms of the common risk factors.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.359
We can plug the formulas for the variances and

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:13.310
covariances into the four elements of this covariance matrix of assets.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.799
It becomes a bit hard to read.

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.530
So, let's use these images of ice cream to help us keep track of the different pieces.
