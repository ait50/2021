00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.365
Recall that I'm referring to the first stock as butter pecan ice cream.

00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:07.200
The second stock can be modeled in a similar way.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.080
We can think of it as another flavor of ice cream.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.925
Like mint chocolate chip.

00:00:11.925 --> 00:00:17.425
Similar to before, the second stocks variance can be modeled as two parts.

00:00:17.425 --> 00:00:20.484
The part that is explained by the common risk factors,

00:00:20.484 --> 00:00:22.980
and the part that is not.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.910
I'd like to point out something very cool.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.484
Which is that all the values that you see inside a variance operator or

00:00:30.484 --> 00:00:35.274
covariance operator contain just the risk factor as one in two.

00:00:35.274 --> 00:00:38.100
Which we've nicknamed sugar and milk.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.390
The variance and covariance functions don't need

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.000
to include information that is specific to

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.859
the stocks because we can take

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:50.215
the factor exposures outside of the variance and covariance operators.

00:00:50.215 --> 00:00:54.020
This is very helpful because as you'll see later on,

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.175
it greatly simplifies the number of pairwise covariances that we'll need to estimate.

00:00:59.174 --> 00:01:04.390
So, now that we have models that describe the individual variances of the two stocks,

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.209
what is the pairwise covariance of these two stocks?

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.480
To get the covariance of the two stocks,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.715
we substitute their returns with the factor models of their returns.

00:01:15.715 --> 00:01:20.314
Now, we have a covariance of two expressions and each expression

00:01:20.314 --> 00:01:25.094
is some weighted sum of two factors and it's specific return.

00:01:25.094 --> 00:01:27.679
To help keep track of these formulas,

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.745
notice that for the first stock,

00:01:29.745 --> 00:01:33.145
factor 1's contribution is labeled with white sugar,

00:01:33.144 --> 00:01:37.159
while factor 2's contribution is labeled with plain milk.

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.269
Also, for stock 2,

00:01:39.269 --> 00:01:42.060
factor 1's contribution is brown sugar,

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.260
while factor 2's contribution is chocolate milk.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.859
Our next step is to apply the pairwise covariance operator on each pair of terms.

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:56.569
We see that each stock is the sum of three terms.

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:01.324
This would end up with three times three or nine covariances.

00:02:01.325 --> 00:02:05.019
You can pause the video for a bit to study this.

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.990
By definition, the specific returns are uncorrelated with the factors.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:17.060
So, the five pairwise covariances that include the specific returns will become zero.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.689
In other words, wherever we see a covariance that contains pecan or chocolate chips,

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:26.079
we'll assume the covariance is zero.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.185
The remaining four covariance pairs that include only factors may still be non-zero.

00:02:32.185 --> 00:02:34.370
So, we'll keep these.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.009
These are the four pairwase covariances written out.

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:45.895
For example, here's the covariance between the contribution of factor 1 to stock 1,

00:02:45.895 --> 00:02:49.380
and the contribution of factor 1 to stock 2.

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.460
The images here are to help you keep track of the notation.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.655
You can see the four pairs of covariances among the white sugar,

00:02:57.655 --> 00:03:01.360
brown sugar, plain milk, and chocolate milk.
