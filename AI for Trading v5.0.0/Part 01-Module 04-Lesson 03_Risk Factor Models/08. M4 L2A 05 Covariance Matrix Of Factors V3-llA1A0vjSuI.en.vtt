00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
We can also model the portfolio's variance as a function of factors.

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.230
The portfolio's variance can be broken up into two parts,

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.890
the risk contribution of the factors,

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.689
and the specific risk that is not due to the factors.

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:21.094
Note that is similar to what we saw earlier with the factor model of returns.

00:00:21.094 --> 00:00:25.464
The end goal is to become familiar with this formula,

00:00:25.464 --> 00:00:30.105
which models portfolio variance in terms of common factors.

00:00:30.105 --> 00:00:33.750
These variables represent matrices.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.715
The point of these matrix multiplications is to add up

00:00:37.715 --> 00:00:41.859
the individual stock variances and pairwise covariances,

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:44.950
to get the variance of the entire portfolio.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.730
Also, to remember the various pieces and to make the math easier to digest,

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:54.754
I'll use ice cream as an analogy to describe the variables.

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:58.340
Here's the covariance matrix of factors,

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.835
we can think of this as the main ingredients for making the ice cream,

00:01:02.835 --> 00:01:05.629
such as milk and sugar.

00:01:05.629 --> 00:01:08.908
Here is the matrix of factor exposures,

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.815
as well as its transpose,

00:01:10.814 --> 00:01:15.620
which we can think of as measuring spoons for the ingredients.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.390
Here's the matrix of specific variances,

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.739
also known as idiosyncratic variances.

00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:27.189
Which we can think of as ingredients that are specific to each ice cream,

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.474
such as pecans or chocolate chips.

00:01:30.474 --> 00:01:35.969
Finally, there is the matrix of portfolio weights, and its transpose.

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:39.048
We can think of these as ice cream scoops,

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.600
which help us choose how much of each flavor of ice cream to put in our bowl.
