00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.915
Let's begin with our matrix notation,

00:00:02.915 --> 00:00:05.689
and consider a portfolio with two stocks,

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.830
in a model that uses two factors.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.539
The variance of the portfolio is the weighted sum of

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:17.509
the variances and pairwise covariances of its stocks.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.560
We can think of each stock as a different flavor of ice cream,

00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:25.164
such as butter pecan or mint chocolate chip.

00:00:25.164 --> 00:00:27.265
We'll start with the first stock.

00:00:27.265 --> 00:00:34.575
Its return is modeled as a linear combination of the factors plus the specific return.

00:00:34.575 --> 00:00:38.480
These factors are used in the model to describe all the stocks.

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:43.053
So, in the context of risk modeling we call these common factors.

00:00:43.054 --> 00:00:46.965
Risk factors, or common risk factors.

00:00:46.965 --> 00:00:50.890
Let's take the variance of both sides of the equation.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.914
This becomes the variance of each factor plus twice the covariance of the factors.

00:00:56.914 --> 00:01:00.500
Plus the variance of the specific return.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.569
The model assumption is that the specific return is not correlated with the factors.

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:10.264
So, this specific return doesn't show up in any covariance operator.

00:01:10.265 --> 00:01:14.890
You can pause the video to study these formulas as needed.

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.469
For constant like the factor exposure,

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:23.129
we can move it to the outside of the variance operator if we square it.

00:01:23.129 --> 00:01:30.089
Similarly, we can move the factor exposures to the outside of the covariance operators.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:37.480
The sum of the first three terms containing the factors is the systematic variance.

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:44.465
The last term is the specific variance also called the idiosyncratic variance.

00:01:44.465 --> 00:01:48.799
If we think of this first stock as butter pecan ice cream,

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.734
then the systematic variance describes the main ingredients such as sugar and milk.

00:01:53.734 --> 00:01:57.890
While the specific variance describes the pecans.

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.959
Okay. That was the variance of one stock.

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:03.824
Let's look at the second stock,

00:02:03.825 --> 00:02:08.104
and see how these two mixed together to create a bowl of ice cream.

00:02:08.104 --> 00:02:11.489
I mean, a portfolio of stocks.
