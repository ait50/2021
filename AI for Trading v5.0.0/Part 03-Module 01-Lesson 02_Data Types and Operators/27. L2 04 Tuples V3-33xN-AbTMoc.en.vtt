00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:07.095
Python provides another useful container, tuples.

00:00:07.095 --> 00:00:11.370
Tuples are used to store related pieces of information.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.970
A tuple is a data structure in Python that is an immutable ordered sequence of elements.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.410
Consider this example involving latitude and longitude.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.695
Tuples are similar to lists in that they store

00:00:25.695 --> 00:00:30.240
an ordered collection of objects which can be accessed by their indices.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.410
For example, location zero and location one.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.460
Unlike lists however, tuples are immutable.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.565
You cannot add or remove items from tuples or sort them in place.

00:00:43.565 --> 00:00:47.945
Why do we have tuples if they're like lists with fewer features?

00:00:47.945 --> 00:00:51.890
Tuples are useful when you have two or more values that are so

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.400
closely related that they will always be used together,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.090
like latitude and longitude coordinates.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.665
Tuples can also be used to assign multiple variables in a compact way.

00:01:03.665 --> 00:01:06.995
Notice that the values assigned to the tuple dimensions

00:01:06.995 --> 00:01:10.885
aren't surrounded with parentheses as previous examples were.

00:01:10.885 --> 00:01:14.510
The parentheses are optional when making tuples and

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.095
programmers frequently omit them if parentheses don't clarify the code.

00:01:19.095 --> 00:01:20.780
In the second line,

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.665
three variables are assigned from the content of the tuple dimensions,

00:01:24.665 --> 00:01:27.365
this is called tuple unpacking.

00:01:27.365 --> 00:01:31.700
You can use tuple unpacking to assign the information from a tuple

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.440
into multiple variables without having to access them one by one,

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.875
and make multiple assignment statements.

00:01:38.875 --> 00:01:43.760
In this example, if we won't need to use dimensions directly,

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.250
we could shorten those two lines of code into

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.430
a single line that assigns three variables in one go.
