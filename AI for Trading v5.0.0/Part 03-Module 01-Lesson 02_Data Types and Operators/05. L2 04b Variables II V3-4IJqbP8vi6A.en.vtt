00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:09.619
Python also has a useful way to assign multiple variables at once.

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:13.009
These three assignments can be abbreviated using

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.814
multiple assignments like this: x is still assigned to two,

00:00:17.815 --> 00:00:21.635
y to three, and z to five.

00:00:21.635 --> 00:00:25.510
You can use this when you're assigning closely related variables like

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.495
the width and height of an object or an object coordinates.

00:00:30.495 --> 00:00:32.899
In this example, we used x,

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.494
y, and z as variable names.

00:00:35.494 --> 00:00:39.409
However, normally, we'd want something more descriptive.

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:41.329
x, y, and z would be

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.155
appropriate variable names for something like coordinates in a 3D space.

00:00:46.155 --> 00:00:49.539
But for most other situations, we can do better.

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:53.490
For example, if you were computing the population density of

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.140
Mountain View by dividing the population by the land area,

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.335
this is one way to compute the correct answer.

00:01:01.335 --> 00:01:05.010
But it's much clear with these variable names,

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.734
which are actually descriptive of the values they represent.

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:10.939
In addition to being descriptive,

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.444
there are a few things to watch out for when naming variables in Python.

00:01:15.444 --> 00:01:19.034
First, only use ordinary letters,

00:01:19.034 --> 00:01:22.229
numbers, or underscores in your variable names.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.734
They can't have spaces and need to start with a letter or underscore.

00:01:27.734 --> 00:01:30.480
Second, you can't use reserved words or

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.275
built-in identifiers that have important purposes in Python,

00:01:34.275 --> 00:01:37.560
which you'll learn about throughout this course.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.010
There are also links below. Using them as variable names will lead to

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.950
errors or problematic situations when you try to use that word for its intended purpose.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.760
Third, the pythonic way to name variables is to

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.359
use all lowercase letters and underscores to separate words.
