00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.283
Welcome to this lesson on data types and operators.

00:00:04.283 --> 00:00:07.410
This is a very important lesson because it's where you'll learn about

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.445
the building blocks of Python datatypes and operators.

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:14.880
Students tend to learn how to program at different rates.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.609
Take your time understanding each of the concepts that

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.285
follow and getting practice with activities in this lesson.

00:00:21.285 --> 00:00:25.740
Having a firm grasp on these building blocks will provide a strong foundation

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:30.464
for future lessons and essential skills to continue programming beyond this course.

00:00:30.464 --> 00:00:34.979
Throughout this course, we'll go through code examples using these boxes.

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:40.064
This first box represents the Code Editor which is where we will input our Python code,

00:00:40.064 --> 00:00:41.849
and the second box represents

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.045
the output window which is where our results will be displayed.

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:47.910
You can follow along with the video examples in

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:51.974
the classroom by typing in the code editor below each video.

00:00:51.975 --> 00:00:58.230
Click the Test Run button to run your code and view the results in the output window.

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:01.079
You'll be seeing this print function pretty often.

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.824
It helps us see what's going on in our code.

00:01:03.825 --> 00:01:08.335
For example, let's say you wanted to compute three plus five.

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:10.519
If we run this line of code,

00:01:10.519 --> 00:01:13.789
Python would still add three and five but we wouldn't see

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.734
the result because we didn't tell Python to do anything with it.

00:01:17.734 --> 00:01:24.432
Print is a useful built-in function in Python that we can use to display our results.

00:01:24.433 --> 00:01:27.080
All we have to do is type in Print followed by

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:30.679
parentheses around whatever we want printed.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.835
You will be using Print often as you get to know the building blocks of Python,

00:01:34.834 --> 00:01:36.849
its data types and operators.
