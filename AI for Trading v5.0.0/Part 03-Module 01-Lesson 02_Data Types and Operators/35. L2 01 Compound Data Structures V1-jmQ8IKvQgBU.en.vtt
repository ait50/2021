00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.720
In the elements dictionary we saw earlier,

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.675
element names which are strings are mapped to their atomic numbers which are integers.

00:00:11.675 --> 00:00:15.595
But what if we wanted to store more information about each element,

00:00:15.595 --> 00:00:17.770
like their weight and symbol.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.660
We can do that by adjusting this dictionary so that it maps

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.360
the element names to another dictionary that stores that collection of data.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.190
We can look up information about an entry in

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.840
this nested dictionary in the same ways we did before,

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.775
with square brackets or the GET method.

00:00:35.775 --> 00:00:40.575
We can look up specific information from the helium dictionary like this.

00:00:40.575 --> 00:00:45.490
This code is first looking up the key helium in the elements dictionary,

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.245
producing the helium dictionary.

00:00:48.245 --> 00:00:50.340
The second lookup weight,

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.160
then looks up the weight key in that helium dictionary to find helium's atomic weight.
