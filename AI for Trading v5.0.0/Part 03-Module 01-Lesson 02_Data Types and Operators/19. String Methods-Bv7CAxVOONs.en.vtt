00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.169
So far, we've seen two distinct ways to process

00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:08.519
data with Python, operators and functions.

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.529
We've used operators like these,

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:14.904
which process the two values on either side of the operator.

00:00:14.904 --> 00:00:18.460
We've also used functions like print and len.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.780
Functions are very similar to operators.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.400
In fact, the only real difference is in how they look.

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:30.919
Function Inputs are put in parentheses rather than being placed next to an operator,

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.525
and functions have descriptive names rather than short symbols.

00:00:35.524 --> 00:00:40.725
There is a third technique for operating on values, methods.

00:00:40.725 --> 00:00:44.695
The best way to learn about methods is with an example.

00:00:44.695 --> 00:00:47.466
Consider this title method.

00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:49.375
Methods are related to functions,

00:00:49.375 --> 00:00:55.024
but unlike functions, methods are associated with specific types of objects.

00:00:55.024 --> 00:01:00.640
That is, there are different methods depending on the type of data you're working with.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.564
In this example, the object is a string with the value

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:08.694
Sebastian Thrun and we are calling its title method.

00:01:08.694 --> 00:01:12.527
The method returns a string in title case,

00:01:12.528 --> 00:01:16.885
meaning the first letter of each word is capitalized.

00:01:16.885 --> 00:01:20.728
So methods are functions that belong to an object,

00:01:20.728 --> 00:01:24.799
an object, for example, being a string.

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.750
Let's try another string method, islower().

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.719
The lower method checks one of the characters in a string or lowercase.

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:37.510
In this case, the string object is sebastian thrun.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.020
Is lower returns true since there are

00:01:40.019 --> 00:01:43.109
no uppercase letters you've probably

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:46.635
noticed that when we call the is lower and title methods,

00:01:46.635 --> 00:01:49.350
we use parentheses, but we haven't put

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:53.079
anything in them like we did when calling functions.

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:56.989
Those inputs in the parentheses are called arguments.

00:01:56.989 --> 00:02:02.024
Since methods or special types of functions that belong to an object,

00:02:02.025 --> 00:02:06.090
the object is always the first argument to a method.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.330
So, is lower and title actually did have

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.285
an argument although there was nothing in the parentheses.

00:02:13.284 --> 00:02:17.250
The argument is disguised as the string object.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.500
Let's try a method that takes more arguments than just the object, count.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:30.064
Here, the count method returns how many times the substring fish occurs in the string.

00:02:30.064 --> 00:02:33.079
The object is the string, one fish,

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.230
two fish, red fish, blue fish,

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:39.109
and the method is dot count,

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.000
and four occurrences of the word fish exist in the string.
