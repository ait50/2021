00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.639
What makes it so hard for computers to understand us?

00:00:04.639 --> 00:00:07.080
One drawback of human languages,

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.599
or feature depending on how you look at it,

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.750
is the lack of a precisely defined structure.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.990
To understand how that makes things difficult let's

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.879
first take a look at some languages that are more structured.

00:00:19.879 --> 00:00:23.750
Mathematics, for instance, uses a structured language.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.809
When I write y equals 2x plus 5 there is no ambiguity in what I want to convey.

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:36.899
I'm saying that the variable y is related to the variable x as two times x plus five.

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.679
Formal logic also uses a structure language.

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:49.426
For example, consider the expression parent(x,y) and parent(x,z) implies sibling(y, z).

00:00:49.426 --> 00:00:55.545
This statement is asserting that if x is a parent of y and x is a parent of z,

00:00:55.545 --> 00:00:58.535
then y and z are siblings.

00:00:58.534 --> 00:01:02.288
A set of structure languages that may be more

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:06.359
familiar to you are scripting and programming languages.

00:01:06.358 --> 00:01:08.640
Consider this SQL statement.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.394
SELECT name, email FROM users WHERE name LIKE A%.

00:01:14.394 --> 00:01:17.500
We are asking the database to return the names and

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.805
e-mail addresses of all users whose names begin with an A.

00:01:22.805 --> 00:01:25.299
These languages are designed to be as

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:30.000
unambiguous as possible and are suitable for computers to process.
