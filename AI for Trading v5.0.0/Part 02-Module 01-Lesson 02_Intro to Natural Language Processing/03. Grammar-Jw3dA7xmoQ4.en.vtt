00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.569
Structured languages are easy to parse and understand for

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:09.134
computers because they are defined by a strict set of rules or grammar.

00:00:09.134 --> 00:00:13.214
There are standard forms of expressing such grammars and algorithms,

00:00:13.214 --> 00:00:18.510
that can parse properly formed statements to understand exactly what is meant.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.165
When a statement doesn't match the prescribed grammar,

00:00:22.164 --> 00:00:26.683
a typical computer doesn't try to guess the meaning, it simply gives up.

00:00:26.684 --> 00:00:32.810
Such violations of grammatical rules are reported as syntax errors.
