00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.469
The languages we use to communicate with each other also have defined grammatical rules.

00:00:06.469 --> 00:00:08.585
And indeed, in some situations we use

00:00:08.585 --> 00:00:11.460
simple structured sentences but for

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.734
the most part human discourse is complex and unstructured.

00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:19.320
Despite that, we seem to be really good at understanding

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.210
each other and even ambiguities are welcome to a certain extent.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.710
So, what can computers do to make sense of unstructured text?

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.295
Here are some preliminary ideas.

00:00:31.295 --> 00:00:35.173
Computers can do some level of processing with words and phrases,

00:00:35.173 --> 00:00:37.109
trying to identify key words,

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:41.780
parts of speech, named entities, dates, quantities, etc.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.317
Using this information they can also try to parse sentences,

00:00:46.317 --> 00:00:49.630
at least ones that are relatively more structured.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.780
This can help extract the relevant parts of statements, questions, or instructions.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.490
At a higher level computers can analyze documents to find frequent and rare words,

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.894
assess the overall tone or sentiment being expressed,

00:01:03.893 --> 00:01:07.394
and even cluster or group similar documents together.

00:01:07.394 --> 00:01:10.750
You can imagine that building on top of these ideas,

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.688
computers can do a whole lot with

00:01:12.688 --> 00:01:17.000
unstructured text even if they cannot understand it like us.
