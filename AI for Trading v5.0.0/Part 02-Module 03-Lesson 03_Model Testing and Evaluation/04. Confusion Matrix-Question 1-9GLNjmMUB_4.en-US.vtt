00:00:00.389 --> 00:00:03.730
So after we develop a model,
we want to find out how good it is.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.131
This is a difficult question,
but in this section,

00:00:06.131 --> 00:00:09.635
we'll learn a few different metrics
that will tell us how good our model is.

00:00:09.635 --> 00:00:11.519
So we're going to look
at two main examples.

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.381
The first example is a model that will
help us detect a particular illness and

00:00:16.382 --> 00:00:19.920
tell if a patient is healthy or sick.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.750
The second example will be a spam
detector which will help us determine

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.940
if an email is spam or not.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.140
For example, on the left,

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.899
you have a email from your grandma,
which you don't want to label as spam.

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:33.670
On the right, you have an email
that is clearly spam and

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.800
you want to send that
to the spam folder.

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:38.239
So let's look at the model for
diagnosing an illness.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.850
There are four possible cases.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.990
When a patient is sick and the model
correctly diagnoses them as sick, this

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.980
is a sick patient I will send in for
further examination or for treatment.

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:50.239
This case we'll call a true positive.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.550
When a patient is healthy and the model
correctly diagnoses them as healthy,

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:55.679
this is a healthy patient
that we'll send home.

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:57.789
This case we call a true negative.

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:01.664
When a patient is sick and the model
incorrectly diagnoses them as healthy,

00:01:01.664 --> 00:01:02.813
this is a mistake, and

00:01:02.813 --> 00:01:06.402
it means we'll be sending a sick
patient back home with no treatment.

00:01:06.402 --> 00:01:08.040
This is called a false negative.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.560
And finally,
when a patient is healthy and

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.700
the model incorrectly diagnoses them
as sick, this is also a mistake, and it

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.469
means we'll be sending a healthy person
for further examination or treatment.

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:19.579
This is called a false positive.

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.640
Now we'll introduce what's
called a confusion matrix.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.721
This is a table that will describe
the performance of a model.

00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:27.254
In this model, we have 10,000 patients.

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:30.670
1,000 of them are sick and
have been correctly diagnosed as sick.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.506
We call this true positives.

00:01:32.506 --> 00:01:35.799
200 of them are sick and have been
incorrectly diagnosed as healthy.

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.525
So we call them false negatives.

00:01:37.525 --> 00:01:40.938
800 patients are healthy and
have been incorrectly diagnosed as sick,

00:01:40.938 --> 00:01:42.699
we call these false positives.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.268
And finally,
8,000 patients are healthy and

00:01:45.268 --> 00:01:49.460
have been correctly diagnosed as
healthy, we call these true negatives.

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:52.649
The confusion matrix is simply the table
that stores these four values.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.576
Now let's look at the model for
detecting spam email.

00:01:54.575 --> 00:01:56.489
There are four possible cases.

00:01:56.489 --> 00:01:59.309
When we get a spam email and the
classifier sends it to our spam folder

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.600
correctly, which is a true positive.

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:02.609
When we get spam email and

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:06.670
the classifier incorrectly sends it to
our inbox, this is a false negative.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.500
When we get a good email, for example,
from our grandma, and the classifier

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.259
incorrectly sends it to our spam folder,
this is called a false positive.

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:14.599
And finally,
when we get a good email and

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.109
the classifier correctly sends it to
our inbox, which is a true negative.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.730
And we can also find the confusion
matrix for this model.

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:23.469
Here we have a pool of 1,000 e-mails.

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:24.453
Out of these e-mails,

00:02:24.453 --> 00:02:27.215
100 spam e-mails have been
correctly sent to the spam folder.

00:02:27.215 --> 00:02:30.747
170 spam e-mails have been
incorrectly sent to the inbox.

00:02:30.747 --> 00:02:34.198
30 non-spam emails have been
incorrectly sent to the spam folder.

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:38.530
And finally, 700 non-spam e-mails have
been correctly sent to the inbox.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.469
So here is the confusion matrix.

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:42.680
Now it's your turn to
create a confusion matrix.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.498
Look at this data where the blue
points are positive and

00:02:45.497 --> 00:02:47.036
the red points are negative.

00:02:47.036 --> 00:02:50.816
The model we've trained is the line that
separates them, with the positive region

00:02:50.816 --> 00:02:54.210
being in the top and
the negative region in the bottom.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.740
Now please fill in the following four
blanks in the confusion matrix for

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.620
number of true positives,
true positives, false positives, and

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.430
false negatives.
