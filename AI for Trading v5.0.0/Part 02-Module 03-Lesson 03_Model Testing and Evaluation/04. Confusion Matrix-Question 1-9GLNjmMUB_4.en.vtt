00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.490
So after we develop a model,

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.405
we want to find out how good it is.

00:00:04.405 --> 00:00:05.600
This is a difficult question.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.750
But in this section, we'll learn

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.380
a few different metrics that will tell us how good our model is.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.175
So we're going to look at two main examples.

00:00:12.175 --> 00:00:16.605
The first example is a model that will help us detect a particular illness,

00:00:16.605 --> 00:00:20.575
and tell if a patient is healthy or sick.

00:00:20.575 --> 00:00:22.920
The second example will be a spam detector,

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.550
which will help us determine if an email is spam or not.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.780
For example, on the left,

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.265
you have an email from your grandma,

00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:31.320
which you don't want to label a spam.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.345
On the right, you have an email that is

00:00:33.345 --> 00:00:36.420
clearly spam and you want to send that to the spam folder.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.880
So let's look at the model for diagnosing an illness.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.380
There are four possible cases.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.800
When a patient is sick,

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.375
and the model correctly diagnosed them as sick.

00:00:44.375 --> 00:00:45.550
This is a sick patient,

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.620
I will send in for further examination or for treatment.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.880
This case, we'll call a true positive.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.215
When a patient is healthy and the model correctly diagnosed him as healthy,

00:00:54.215 --> 00:00:56.235
this is a healthy patient that we'll send home.

00:00:56.235 --> 00:00:58.370
This case, we call a true negative.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.130
When a patient is sick and the modeling correctly diagnosed them as healthy.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.188
This is a mistake,

00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:07.125
and it means we'll be sending a sick patient back home with no treatment.

00:01:07.125 --> 00:01:08.670
This is called a false negative.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.965
And finally, when a patient is healthy and the model incorrectly diagnoses them as sick.

00:01:12.965 --> 00:01:14.130
This is also a mistake,

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.120
and it means we'll be sending a healthy person for further examination or treatment.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.220
This is called a false positive.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.320
Now, we'll introduce what's called the confusion matrix.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.140
This is a table that will describe the performance of a model.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.005
In this model, we have 10,000 patients.

00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:31.255
A thousand of them are sick and have been correctly diagnosed as sick.

00:01:31.255 --> 00:01:33.100
We call these true positive.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.370
200 of them are sick and have been incorrectly diagnosed them as healthy.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.275
So we call them false negatives.

00:01:38.275 --> 00:01:41.790
800 patients are healthy and have been incorrectly diagnosed as sick.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.260
We call these false positives.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.740
And finally, 8,000 patients are healthy and have been correctly diagnosed as healthy.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.880
We call these true negatives.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.280
The confusion matrix is a simple table that stores these four values.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.290
Now let's look at the model for detecting spam email.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.835
There are four possible cases.

00:01:56.835 --> 00:01:59.300
When we get a spam email and the classifier sends it to

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.230
a spam folder correctly, which is a true positive.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.615
When we get a spam email and the classifier incorrectly sends it to our inbox,

00:02:05.615 --> 00:02:07.270
this is a false negative.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.730
When we get a good email, for example,

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:12.360
from our grandma and the classifier incorrectly sends it to our spam folder,

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.920
this is called a false positive.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.595
And finally, when we get a good email the classifier correctly sends it to our inbox,

00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:19.355
which is a true negative.

00:02:19.355 --> 00:02:22.365
And we can also find the confusion matrix for this model.

00:02:22.365 --> 00:02:24.135
Here, we have a pool of a thousand emails.

00:02:24.135 --> 00:02:27.845
Out of these emails, 100 spam emails have been correctly sent to the spam folder.

00:02:27.845 --> 00:02:31.463
170 spam emails have been incorrectly sent to the inbox.

00:02:31.463 --> 00:02:34.880
30 non-spam emails have been incorrectly sent to the spam folder.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.175
And finally, 700 non-spam emails have been correctly sent to the inbox.

00:02:39.175 --> 00:02:41.100
So here is the confusion matrix.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.280
Now it's your turn to create a confusion matrix.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.960
Look at this data where the blue points are positive,

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.760
and the red points are negative.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.250
The model we've trained is the line that separates them,

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.530
with the positive region being in the top,

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.840
and the negative region in the bottom.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.910
Now please fill in the following four blanks in

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.990
the confusion matrix for number of true positives,

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.050
true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
