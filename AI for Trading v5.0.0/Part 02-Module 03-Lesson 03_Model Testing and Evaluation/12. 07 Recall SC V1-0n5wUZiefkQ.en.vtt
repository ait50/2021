00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.895
Now, let's look at the second metric, which is recall.

00:00:02.895 --> 00:00:05.009
Recall is the answer to the following question,

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.500
out of the points that are labeled positive,

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.529
how many of them were correctly predicted as positive?

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:13.949
So in the medical model, a recall is the answer to the following question,

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:15.359
out of the sick patients,

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:18.044
how many did we correctly diagnose as sick?

00:00:18.045 --> 00:00:19.590
So remember, precision was,

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:21.289
out of the patients were diagnosed as sick,

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:22.489
how many were actually sick?

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:23.959
But recall is the opposite;

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.460
out of the patients that are sick,

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.280
how many did we correctly diagnose as sick?

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.405
It can be seen as a reach of the algorithm.

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:33.435
How many of the positive points did I manage to catch?

00:00:33.435 --> 00:00:35.480
The answer is calculated with this row.

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:37.144
As we can see,

00:00:37.145 --> 00:00:39.930
this row catches a critical case labeled by an X,

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:42.835
so we can see that recall is important in the medical model.

00:00:42.835 --> 00:00:44.380
Now to calculate recall,

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.450
we do the following;

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.265
from the 1,200 sick patients,

00:00:47.265 --> 00:00:49.304
how many did we diagnose correctly?

00:00:49.304 --> 00:00:52.319
That's 1,000 divided by 1,200,

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:54.565
which is 83.3 percent.

00:00:54.564 --> 00:00:56.969
This model better have a higher recall because we're trying to

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.905
correctly catch as many of the sick people as possible.

00:00:59.905 --> 00:01:01.380
Now in the email model,

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.760
the recall is defined similarly.

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:04.259
It's calculated as follows;

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.820
from the spam emails,

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:09.479
how many of them do we correctly send to the spam folder?

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.299
The answer is in this row over here.

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:17.004
So we have 100 correctly sent to the spam folder divided by 270 total spam emails.

00:01:17.004 --> 00:01:19.804
It's a low number. It's 37 percent.

00:01:19.805 --> 00:01:24.190
But remember, we are worried about avoiding this X over here,

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:25.719
since we don't mind if we don't catch

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:28.599
all the spam emails as long as the ones we caught are spam.

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:30.969
So it's okay that this model has a low recall.

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:33.750
Now, let's do a similar exercise as before.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.590
In this linear model over here,

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.365
what is the recall?

00:01:37.364 --> 00:01:39.789
Enter your answer below.
