00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.590
So for the medical model,

00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:05.429
it seems that we'd much rather misdiagnose a healthy person as sick and send them for

00:00:05.429 --> 00:00:07.769
more tests than misdiagnose a

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:10.619
sick person as healthy and send them home without treatment.

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:14.204
In this case, a false positive is much worse than a false negative.

00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:15.750
So the rule of this model is,

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.835
I want to find all the sick people.

00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:20.700
I'm okay if I accidentally bring some more that are sick,

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.619
but I need to find all the sick people.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.695
For the spam email model, let's see.

00:00:25.695 --> 00:00:29.160
A false negative means a spam email made its way into your inbox,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.554
and all you had to do is delete it.

00:00:30.554 --> 00:00:32.204
So it's a bit of an inconvenience.

00:00:32.204 --> 00:00:34.500
On the other hand, what's a false positive?

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.390
Your grandma, the poor lady learned to type an email only to tell you she bake cookies,

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.490
and you delete it. That's terrible.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.510
So here, we want to punish false positives more than false negatives.

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:47.369
So this model basically says,

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:51.659
"I don't really care if I find all the spam emails but one thing is for sure,

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:53.444
if I say that an email is spam,

00:00:53.445 --> 00:00:55.020
it better be a spam."

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.965
So as we can see, the medical model and the email model are fundamentally different.

00:00:58.965 --> 00:01:03.570
The medical model as we saw is okay with false positives but not with false negatives,

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.189
since we're okay misdiagnosing

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.129
some patients as sick as long as we find all the sick people.

00:01:08.129 --> 00:01:10.349
The email model on the other hand is okay with

00:01:10.349 --> 00:01:12.419
false negatives but not with false positives,

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.280
since we don't necessarily need to find all the spam emails but one thing is for sure,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.685
that if we do label something as spam, it better be spam.

00:01:20.685 --> 00:01:24.135
For this, we introduced two metrics, precision and recall.

00:01:24.135 --> 00:01:27.885
They will measure the exact things that we want, namely,

00:01:27.885 --> 00:01:29.190
the medical model needs to be

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.899
a high recall model and the email model needs to be high precision model.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.900
We'll talk about them more in detail in the next couple of videos.
