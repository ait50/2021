00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.370
Well, let's remember that accuracy is a ratio between

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.340
the correctly classified points and the total number of points.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.030
We notice that there are six points correctly classified as

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.310
positive and five correctly classified as negative.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.420
These add to 11 correctly classified points.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.385
Since the total number of points is 14,

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:22.815
we conclude that the answer is equal to 11 divided by 14,

00:00:22.815 --> 00:00:26.140
which gives an answer of 78.57
