00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.299
Now, accuracy may not always be the best metric to use.

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:04.904
Let's look at this example.

00:00:04.905 --> 00:00:07.200
It consists of detecting credit card fraud.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.769
So, we have a bunch of data in the form of credit card transactions,

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.879
and some of them are good like the ones in the left,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.630
and some of them are fraudulent like the ones in the right.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.160
So, let's look at numbers.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.329
There are 284,335 good transactions and 472 fraudulent transactions.

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:25.829
This is actually real data.

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.349
So, let's try to come up with a model that has great accuracy.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.975
So, a model that is correct most of the time.

00:00:30.975 --> 00:00:35.870
Can you help me think of a model that has over 99 percent accuracy?

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:39.429
So here's a model that has over 99 percent accuracy,

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:42.575
which means it is correct over 99 percent of the time.

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:46.304
The model says, all the transactions are good.

00:00:46.304 --> 00:00:48.320
Now, what is the accuracy of this model,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.085
namely how many times are we correct?

00:00:51.085 --> 00:01:00.350
Well, we're correct 284,335 times out of 284,887 times.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.765
And that is 99.83 percent.

00:01:03.765 --> 00:01:06.239
So, this model must be pretty good if it's accurate is that high,

00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:07.829
right? Well, not really.

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:10.620
This model is not catching any of the bad ones.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.265
And the point of the model is to catch the fraudulent transactions.

00:01:14.265 --> 00:01:15.879
So let's look at another model.

00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:18.379
Can we get a model that catches all the bad transactions?

00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:20.924
Can we think of one? Well, here's one,

00:01:20.924 --> 00:01:24.149
I'm going to label all transactions fraudulent. So, that's great, right?

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.090
Now, we're catching all the fraudulent transactions.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.990
Now, is that a good model? Well, no.

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:32.479
That's also a terrible model since it's accidentally catching all the good ones.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.109
So, it's pretty tricky, right?

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:37.379
It's pretty tricky to just look at accuracy and use that to evaluate our model

00:01:37.379 --> 00:01:41.244
because it may completely miss the point when the data is skewed like this one.

00:01:41.245 --> 00:01:46.130
So, in this section, we'll study some different metrics that can catch this more easily.
