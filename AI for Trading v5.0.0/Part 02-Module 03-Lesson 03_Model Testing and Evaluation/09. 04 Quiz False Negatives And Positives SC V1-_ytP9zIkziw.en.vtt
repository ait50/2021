00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280
So let's go back to our two examples: a medical model and spam e-mail model.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.200
Recall that for the medical model,

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.050
we have four possibilities: a true

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.725
positive which is when the patient is sick and we correctly diagnosed him as sick;

00:00:13.724 --> 00:00:16.710
a true negative which is when the patient is not

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.785
sick and we correctly diagnose them as not sick;

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:22.324
a false positive which is when the patient is healthy

00:00:22.324 --> 00:00:24.814
and we incorrectly diagnose them as sick;

00:00:24.815 --> 00:00:27.450
and finally a false negative which is when the patient is

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.285
sick and we incorrectly diagnose them as healthy.

00:00:30.285 --> 00:00:34.390
Now, let's forget about the two correct ones and focus only on the mistakes.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.179
Below, we'll have a quiz.

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:38.039
Which one do you think is worse,

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:40.710
a false positive or a false negative?

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.410
In other words, what is the worst mistake,

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:47.129
to misdiagnose a healthy patient as sick or a sick patient as healthy?

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.590
Now, let's go back to our other model,

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.805
the spam e-mail model.

00:00:50.804 --> 00:00:53.939
So we have two e-mails: one non-spam from our grandma telling us

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:57.349
she baked cookies and one spam from a questionable source.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.995
Recall that for this model,

00:00:58.994 --> 00:01:01.994
we again have four possibilities: a true positive

00:01:01.994 --> 00:01:05.399
which is when the spam e-mail gets correctly sent into the spam folder;

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.650
a true negative which is when our grandma's e-mail

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.960
gets correctly sent to the inbox folder;

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:14.324
a false positive which grandma's e-mail accidentally gets sent to the spam folder;

00:01:14.325 --> 00:01:16.079
and finally a false negative which is when

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:18.879
a spam e-mail accidentally gets sent to our inbox.

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:23.009
Now, again, let's forget about the two correct ones and focus only on the mistakes.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.915
So below, there will be another quiz.

00:01:24.915 --> 00:01:26.670
Which one do you think is worse,

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.189
a false positive or a false negative?

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.469
In other words, what is a worse mistake,

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:33.450
to accidentally send your grandma's email to

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.980
the spam folder or to accidentally send the spam email into your inbox?

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.660
Enter your answers below.
