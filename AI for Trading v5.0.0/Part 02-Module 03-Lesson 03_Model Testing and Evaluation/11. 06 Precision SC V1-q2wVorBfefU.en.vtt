00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So let's define the precision metric as follows.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.660
Here's the confusion matrix of the medical model,

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.120
and we've added a red X in the spot that we really want to avoid,

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:10.514
which is the false negatives.

00:00:10.515 --> 00:00:12.605
So precision will be the answer to the question,

00:00:12.605 --> 00:00:15.570
out of all the points predicted to be positive,

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.820
how many of them were actually positive?

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.030
In this case, the question translates to,

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.400
out of all the patients that we diagnosed as sick,

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:27.849
how many were actually sick?

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.600
So precision is this column because this column are

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.204
the sick patients that we diagnose as sick.

00:00:33.204 --> 00:00:35.728
So it is 1,000 that were correct,

00:00:35.728 --> 00:00:41.714
divided by 1,800, which is the total number of patients diagnosed as sick.

00:00:41.715 --> 00:00:44.555
This number is 55.7 percent.

00:00:44.554 --> 00:00:47.429
It's not a high number because this is not a very precise model.

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:52.454
But, again, this is okay because what we're doing is avoiding this red X.

00:00:52.454 --> 00:00:54.784
Now let's look at the spam email model.

00:00:54.784 --> 00:00:56.339
What is this precision?

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.920
Now, we know that in this model,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.900
precision is very important because the red X that we're avoiding is in this column.

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.069
The red X is the non-spam email that were accidentally sent to the spam folder.

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:10.409
So those 30 errors are really bad and we want to avoid them.

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.244
So, again, precision says,

00:01:12.245 --> 00:01:14.300
''Out of all the emails sent to the spam folder,

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.489
how many of them were actually spam?"

00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:19.409
So we have 100 which are correct,

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.179
divided by 130 which is all the ones we've sent to the spam folder.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.230
This number is 76.9 percent, which is higher.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.049
This is better since this model needs high precision,

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.864
so the number better be big.

00:01:32.864 --> 00:01:34.579
Now, let's do an exercise.

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:36.734
Let's go to a linear model over here.

00:01:36.734 --> 00:01:39.290
What is the precision of this linear model?

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.830
Enter your answer below.
