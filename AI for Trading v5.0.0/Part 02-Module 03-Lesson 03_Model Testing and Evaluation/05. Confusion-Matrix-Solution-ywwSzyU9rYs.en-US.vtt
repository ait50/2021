00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.439
So let's see.

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.439
The true positives are the points
that are positive and

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.150
the model correctly labels as positive.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.890
These are the six blue points over here.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.870
The true negatives are the points
that are negative and

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:15.160
the model correctly labels as negative.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.803
These are the five negative
red points over here.

00:00:17.803 --> 00:00:20.996
And the false positives
are the points that are negative, but

00:00:20.996 --> 00:00:23.960
the model incorrectly
labels as positive.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.230
These are these two
red points over here.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.271
And finally, the false negatives
are the points that are positive but

00:00:30.271 --> 00:00:32.475
the modeling says negative.

00:00:32.475 --> 00:00:35.939
That's just this blue point over here.

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:36.960
So there we go.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.160
That's the confusion matrix.
