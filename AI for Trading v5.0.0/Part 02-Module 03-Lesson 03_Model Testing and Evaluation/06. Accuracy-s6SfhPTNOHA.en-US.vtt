00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.449
Now we'll study one of the ways
to measure how good a model is,

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:04.810
called the accuracy.

00:00:04.809 --> 00:00:05.833
The accuracy is the answer
to the question.

00:00:05.833 --> 00:00:10.410
Out of all the patients,
how many did we classify correctly?

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.519
The answer is, the ratio between the
number of correctly classified points

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.489
and the number of total points.

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:21.649
In this example, we can see that we
have correctly classified ,patients,

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:25.409
which is the sum of 1,000 healthy and
8,000 sick ones.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.140
So the accuracy is this number,

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.960
divided by the total number of patients,
which is 10,000.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.707
This gives us an accuracy of 90%.

00:00:32.707 --> 00:00:37.546
Accuracy can easily be calculated in
sklearn by using the accuracy score

00:00:37.546 --> 00:00:38.939
function.

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:42.799
Now let's see, how much is the accuracy
of the spam detector model?

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:45.140
This is the answer to the question,
out of all the e-mails,

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.390
how many did we classify correctly?

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.608
Since we have correctly classified
800 out of the 1,000 emails,

00:00:52.607 --> 00:00:54.579
then the answer is 80%.

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.939
Now let's calculate the accuracy for
the spam detector model.

00:00:57.939 --> 00:01:01.129
This is the answer to the question,
out of all the e-mails,

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.780
how many did we classify correctly?

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.200
Since we have correctly classified 800
out of 1,000, then the answer is 80%.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.359
Now let's test your knowledge.

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:14.700
In this model, what is the accuracy?

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.420
Please write the number as a percentage,
so a number between 0 and 100.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.840
This number can have decimals.
