00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.029
Here is the outline for the section.

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:04.535
In machine learning we have a problem to solve.

00:00:04.535 --> 00:00:08.470
Normally, the problem corresponds to evaluating some data and making predictions.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.695
That problem is represented by this broken car over here.

00:00:11.695 --> 00:00:13.169
Now, in order to solve it,

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:14.449
we have a few tools.

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:16.289
These tools are the algorithms.

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.699
So things like linear or logistic regression,

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:22.405
as VMs, neural networks decision trees et cetera.

00:00:22.405 --> 00:00:24.539
How do we know which tool works best?

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.269
Well, for that we have a bunch of measurement tools

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.120
and we use them to evaluate all the algorithms.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.280
So once we evaluate the algorithms and

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.590
their parameters and decide which ones are best for our problem,

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.565
then we go ahead and solve the problem.

00:00:37.564 --> 00:00:40.664
In this section, we'll learn the measurement tools.

00:00:40.664 --> 00:00:44.469
So we'll learn a bunch of metrics and techniques that will tell us when an algorithm

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:49.369
is working well with the data and how to tweak them to work best for us.
