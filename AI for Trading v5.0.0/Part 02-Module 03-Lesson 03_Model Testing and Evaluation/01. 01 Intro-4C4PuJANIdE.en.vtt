00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.835
Hi, and welcome to the small evaluation and validation section.

00:00:03.835 --> 00:00:06.839
My name is Luis Serrano and I'm an instructor here at Udacity.

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.705
In this section, we'll focus on two questions.

00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:11.039
The first question is,

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:13.479
how well is my model doing?

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.310
So, let's say we've trained our machine learning model and the question is,

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.894
is this model good or not?

00:00:17.894 --> 00:00:22.015
So, we're going to learn metrics to tell us if it is good or not.

00:00:22.015 --> 00:00:24.615
And the second question is, once we figure that out,

00:00:24.614 --> 00:00:26.894
how do we improve it based on these metrics?

00:00:26.894 --> 00:00:29.594
Let's dive right in and learn to evaluate,

00:00:29.594 --> 00:00:32.000
validate, and improve our machine learning models.
