00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, let's remember that accuracy is a ratio between  

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.300
the correctly classified points and the total number of points.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.960
We notice that there are six points correctly classified as positive,

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.120
and five correctly classified as negative.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.260
These add to eleven correctly classified points.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.255
Since the total number of points is fourteen,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.740
We conclude that the answer is equal to eleven divided by fourteen,
8
00:00:22,740 --&gt; 00:00:00,000
which gives an answer of 78.57%.
