00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.420
So let's see. The true positives are the points that

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.140
are positive and the model correctly labels as positive.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.570
These are the six blue points over here.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.880
The true negatives are the points that are

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.155
negative and the model correctly labels as negative.

00:00:15.155 --> 00:00:18.650
These are the five negative red points over here.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.970
The false positives are the points that are negative

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.970
but the model incorrectly labels as positive.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.220
These are these two red points over here.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.340
And finally, the false negatives are the points that

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.195
are positive but the model incorrectly labels as negative.

00:00:33.195 --> 00:00:35.930
That's just this blue point over here.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.130
So there we go. That's the confusion matrix.
