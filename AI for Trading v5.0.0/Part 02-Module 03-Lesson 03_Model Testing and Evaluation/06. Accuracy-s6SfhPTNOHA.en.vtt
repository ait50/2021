00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
Now, we'll study one of the ways to measure how good a model is,

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.695
called that the accuracy.

00:00:04.695 --> 00:00:06.820
The accuracy is the answer to the question,

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.335
"Out of all the patients, how many did we classify correctly?"

00:00:10.335 --> 00:00:13.500
The answer is, the ratio between the number of

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.350
correctly classified points and the number of total points.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.570
In this example, we can see that we have correctly classified 9,000 patients,

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.350
which is a sum of 1,000 healthy and 8,000 sequence.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.040
So, the accuracy is this number divided by the total number of patients, which is 10,000.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.585
This gives us an accuracy of 90%.

00:00:33.585 --> 00:00:38.780
Accuracy can easily be calculated as you can learn by using the accuracy score function.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.795
Now, let's see how much is the accuracy of the spam detector model?

00:00:42.795 --> 00:00:44.100
This is the answer to the question,

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.165
"Out of all the emails, how many did we classify correctly?"

00:00:47.165 --> 00:00:51.789
Since we have correctly classified 800 out of the 1,000 emails,

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:54.770
then the answer is 80%.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.660
Now, let's test your knowledge.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.230
In this model, what is the accuracy?

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.846
Please write the numbers of percentage.

00:01:00.846 --> 00:01:02.930
So, a number between 0 and 100.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.320
This number can have decimals.
