00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
What's in store for term two?

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.849
Well, term two is design such that you build upon

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:08.879
the foundation you developed in term one and get your hands

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.714
dirty working on some of the most relevant applications of

00:00:11.714 --> 00:00:15.089
AI and machine learning to quantitative investment today.

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.414
You will develop skills to automate the analysis of text-based financial data.

00:00:20.414 --> 00:00:25.125
This is data that financial analysts use to generate investment insights,

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:29.954
but until recently this required labor-intensive human analysis.

00:00:29.954 --> 00:00:33.149
You'll learn to apply in natural language processing and

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.059
recurrent neural networks in order to

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.445
enhance and automate traditional financial analysis.

00:00:38.445 --> 00:00:40.909
You will learn sophisticated machine learning

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:45.304
based methods that combine multiple signals into complex strategies.

00:00:45.304 --> 00:00:50.269
In other words, instead of creating complex conditional factors by hand,

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.810
you'll train a machine learning model to create them instead.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.170
Finally, you will learn the intricacies of back-testing,

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.375
which is crucial to inferring how well

00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:02.575
a strategy may perform under real-world conditions.

00:01:02.575 --> 00:01:05.960
We're really excited for you and for what you'll be able to

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:10.409
do once you complete these projects. So let's get started
