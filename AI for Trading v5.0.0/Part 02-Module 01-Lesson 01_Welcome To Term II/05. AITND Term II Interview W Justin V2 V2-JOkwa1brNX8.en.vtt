00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.940
We'd like to introduce you to Justin.

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:06.419
A quant who has worked at places like Blackrock scientific active equity team.

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:08.535
An elite team of data driven quants.

00:00:08.535 --> 00:00:12.000
Justin helped us develop the program and drew upon his background in

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.599
natural language processing to design the first project in term two.

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.239
So, Justin, how did you get into quantitating?

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:20.399
I started off working for a consulting firm.

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:22.259
I used some of the risk model tools like

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.875
MSCI Barra to analyze client equity portfolios for style risks.

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:28.035
From there, I went to Barclay's Global Investors,

00:00:28.035 --> 00:00:31.214
a predecessor of Blackrock in their scientific active equity group.

00:00:31.214 --> 00:00:35.685
Could you describe the process that quants go through in generating Alpha?

00:00:35.685 --> 00:00:37.155
Do you start with the data?

00:00:37.155 --> 00:00:38.640
Do you start with the model?

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.125
Do you start with an idea?

00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:41.954
Quants follow the scientific method.

00:00:41.954 --> 00:00:44.739
So, first we need to have a thorough understanding of finance,

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.240
of how companies work and what can affect the company's performance.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.359
From there, we form a hypothesis.

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:53.240
Then we use tools and data to test that hypothesis.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.109
It's important to start with the idea first instead of just jumping into the data,

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:58.729
otherwise we'd be data mining.

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:03.409
Patterns in data may form due to random chance or real underlying phenomenon,

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.295
but strategies based on the former will not work well on unseen future data.

00:01:07.295 --> 00:01:09.379
We also read lots of economic,

00:01:09.379 --> 00:01:12.024
accounting literature, and attend financial seminars.

00:01:12.025 --> 00:01:14.930
So, you built one of the projects in term two.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.660
What are students going to do in the project?

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.899
What were the main things you wanted them to learn?

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.109
My main goal was for students to practice

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:24.049
several fundamental natural language processing techniques and to

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.545
see an example of a practical way that can be applied to make stock picks.

00:01:27.545 --> 00:01:29.810
The project is based on the stock selection model

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.030
from an academic paper called lazy prices.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.844
Elements which I've used in practice.

00:01:33.844 --> 00:01:36.260
Students use NLP techniques to scrape

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.410
text information from companies annual financial styling

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.170
and analyze them to produce a signal that indicate

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.265
whether the company's stock price will appreciate or depreciate.

00:01:45.265 --> 00:01:46.905
That sounds really cool.

00:01:46.905 --> 00:01:48.650
It sounds like one example of a way

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.455
new techniques are being used in quantitative finance.

00:01:51.454 --> 00:01:56.230
How else are AI and machine learning being applied in quantitative finance?

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.370
AI and machine learning models are tools that

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.910
quants can use to enhance their existing research method.

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.204
There's a lot of alternative data such as credit card transactions,

00:02:04.204 --> 00:02:07.609
satellite images, and environmental social governance data.

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:09.590
I'd say a major source to opportunity and

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.180
active application in finance is with text data.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.365
Whether it's news, social media,

00:02:14.365 --> 00:02:16.310
financial reports and earnings calls.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.064
The reason is that ideal data set is one that can have broad coverage of many stocks.

00:02:21.064 --> 00:02:25.000
Price volume, and fundamental data fit this criteria and so does texts.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.900
So, natural language processing is one of

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.140
the main applications in research and strategy phase of investment,

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:32.509
where quants process data to generate

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:35.449
Alpha signals that can be fed into portfolio optimization.

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:39.424
For example, quants have known and tried various ways to measure attentional bias.

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:42.160
That is when certain stocks are mentioned more frequently in the news.

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.829
This tends to increase trading activity and volatility for those stocks.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.840
One way to measure this is by calculating

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.284
the skewness of volatility on price volume data.

00:02:50.284 --> 00:02:52.549
Another way is to directly measure the level of

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.265
news reporting on each stock using natural language processing.

00:02:55.264 --> 00:02:59.089
There's also research into processing satellite images to generate signals.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.879
I would point out that for Alpha signals to be most useful,

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.879
they would ideally generate signals for a broad set of companies.

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.250
This is still a challenge when it comes to satellite data.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.409
For example, there's been work done to track

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:12.590
parking lots and estimate the performance of retail companies.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.210
But an ideal Alpha signal is one that would apply broadly across sectors and industries.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.909
Another part of the quant workflow where AI is being

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:22.520
used is to enhance the alpha combination stage.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.740
Traditionally, quants domain knowledge and

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.335
research to propose combinations between signals.

00:03:27.335 --> 00:03:32.270
You may hear of these as conditional factors and we often refer to these as interactions.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.439
Quants can also train a model to find these complex interactions among factors.

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:40.055
There's also been research into applying reinforcement learning to finance.

00:03:40.055 --> 00:03:41.870
I should point out that at the moment,

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.340
reinforcement learning is showing

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.715
more promise in trade execution not an Alpha generation.

00:03:46.715 --> 00:03:49.219
It sounds like there's a lot of opportunity to

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:52.099
utilize new techniques and analyze new data sources.

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.984
What are some of the challenges of applying AI to quantitative investment?

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:57.785
Well, as I mentioned before,

00:03:57.784 --> 00:03:59.599
AI and machine learning are just some of

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:02.930
the many tools available to understand and predict company performance.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.865
In some ways, when you have a hammer,

00:04:04.865 --> 00:04:06.439
everything looks like a nail.

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:11.150
Well-established economic methods are still the best tools for certain tasks.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.159
There are definitely some important challenges to

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:15.395
consider when applying AI techniques and trading.

00:04:15.395 --> 00:04:18.710
In finance, the signal-to-noise ratio is incredibly low.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.439
Financial data have relatively little depth and time.

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:24.589
Some data, especially newer alternative data,

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:26.419
just have not been collected for very long.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.939
So only a few years worth of data exist.

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:30.680
There are challenges unique to time

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.220
series analysis and that there's only ever one instantiation of time.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.635
There's directionality of time.

00:04:36.634 --> 00:04:39.004
Financial time series are non-stationary.

00:04:39.004 --> 00:04:42.324
It's very easy to produce models that are over fit to the training data.

00:04:42.324 --> 00:04:45.574
So, it's critically important to take steps to avoid over-fitting.

00:04:45.574 --> 00:04:48.245
Since there's such a huge risk of over-fitting,

00:04:48.245 --> 00:04:52.720
a key challenge is to develop models that are as simple as possible but not simpler.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.340
Finally, it's typically very important to be able to

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:58.250
explain why a strategy works to managers investors.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.774
Investors may not be comfortable investing in a black box strategy.

00:05:01.774 --> 00:05:05.060
For this reason, being able to interpret models is very

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.735
important and it rains a limitation of many AI tools.

00:05:08.735 --> 00:05:12.080
With all the advances seen in AI and machine learning,

00:05:12.079 --> 00:05:13.909
where do humans fit into all of this?

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.235
Is there's still a need for human intuition?

00:05:16.235 --> 00:05:18.259
Yes. We still need human intuition and

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:21.094
domain expertise to do a sanity check on our models.

00:05:21.095 --> 00:05:22.970
For instance, your team may have

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.985
several models such as outputting signals for every stock.

00:05:25.985 --> 00:05:29.855
It's good practice for quants to quality check a handful of the outputs.

00:05:29.855 --> 00:05:31.939
For instance, we typically look at

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:34.639
the top 15 and bottom 15 stocks that are ranked by

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:37.759
the model and make sure that the model's output makes sense.

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:40.789
Some checks may include watching out for stocks where there may be

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.350
a bio target or that may be exposed to future litigation.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.895
Remember that we use AI and models

00:05:46.894 --> 00:05:49.699
when it's possible to automate some of the data processing.

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:51.589
But there's always going to be information that

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:53.959
can't be distilled and fed directly into the model.

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:57.109
That's why it's important for quants to have a good understanding of how

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.699
financial markets work and still follow financial news very closely.

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:05.014
Also, a model is only as good as the data is fed into it.

00:06:05.014 --> 00:06:08.014
A great deal of work goes into the quality assurance of the data.

00:06:08.014 --> 00:06:10.159
In fact, there are entire teams that are

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.189
dedicated to quality checking the data on a daily basis,

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:15.694
because this is so critical to a firm's performance.

00:06:15.694 --> 00:06:19.430
In order for a quant to effectively apply AI to generate Alpha,

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.764
it's also important for them to have a sound understanding of the data of the model.

00:06:23.764 --> 00:06:25.594
At least for the foreseeable future,

00:06:25.595 --> 00:06:29.960
human intuition is critical to the success of an AI based investment strategy.

00:06:29.959 --> 00:06:32.344
Well, this has really been great.

00:06:32.345 --> 00:06:34.415
Thank you so much for your time.

00:06:34.415 --> 00:06:35.825
One last question.

00:06:35.824 --> 00:06:39.319
What advice would you give to someone just entering the field?

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:41.300
I would say, try to develop

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.125
a broad understanding of as many different models and tools available as you can.

00:06:45.125 --> 00:06:48.620
Deepen your understanding of the application of the models by developing

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.865
personal projects and be able to communicate the steps you took when developing.

00:06:52.865 --> 00:06:56.810
A key part of our role as quants is not only in building the strategies,

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.750
but in understanding them and communicating how they work.
