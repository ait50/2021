00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
Hi, and welcome to term two of AI for trading.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.144
We're so glad that you're here because we have so much exciting stuff to share with you.

00:00:08.144 --> 00:00:11.669
Let's take a moment and recap what you learned in term one.

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:13.814
In the first term of this program,

00:00:13.814 --> 00:00:17.535
you focused on developing domain knowledge and quantitative finance.

00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:20.579
You learned about market mechanics and financial data.

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:23.219
You learned about influential trading strategies,

00:00:23.219 --> 00:00:25.140
such as those based on momentum,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.030
meaner version, and breakouts.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.825
You learned how to conduct original research to generate all those strategies,

00:00:30.824 --> 00:00:31.919
and how to evaluate

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.260
whether these strategies are promising candidates

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:36.629
to be added into an optimized portfolio.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.955
You also applied risk factor models to control major sources of risk,

00:00:41.954 --> 00:00:47.210
thereby allowing your chosen alpha factors to drive the returns of the portfolio.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.020
Finally, you used portfolio optimization to combine

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.020
alpha factors and risk factors into an optimal portfolio,

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.750
the way an orchestra conductor combines various instruments into a musical masterpiece.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.240
This knowledge will serve you well as

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.129
a foundation for your future exploration of quantitative investing.

00:01:06.129 --> 00:01:11.619
To apply AI in financial trading or really any type of modeling in any field,

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.405
you need domain knowledge to be successful.

00:01:14.405 --> 00:01:18.650
This is particularly important in finance due to the nature of the data.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.230
The signal to noise ratio is very low.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.650
The depth, and the data, and time can be low.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.170
There's only one actual instantiation of events.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.439
Applying AI and machine learning models out of the box

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.469
without understanding the underlying phenomenon and data,

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:35.959
is likely to generate strategies that may work

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:38.899
very well when tested on data from the past,

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.795
but will not work well on unseen future data.

00:01:41.795 --> 00:01:44.329
For those familiar with this terminology,

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:46.719
the strategies are likely to be overfit.

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:49.939
With better knowledge of the underlying phenomenon,

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.230
you are less likely to develop a strategy that is based on random noise,

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.140
and more likely to develop a strategy that is based

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.790
on a legitimate source of this pricing in the market
