00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
Today, I have the pleasure of interviewing Gordon Ritter,

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.305
an elite by-side quantitative trader and professor who

00:00:07.305 --> 00:00:11.685
developed the backtesting project in AI for trading ND.

00:00:11.685 --> 00:00:15.450
Gordon, what first attracted you to a career in finance,

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.030
and what do you find fascinating about the field?

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.930
Well, I was originally attracted to a career in finance because

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.965
of a totally amazing teacher I had in graduate school.

00:00:25.965 --> 00:00:28.800
His name was Robert C. Merton.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.860
Professor Merton was a professor in the Harvard Business School at the time.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.905
So he was teaching a course in continuous time finance over at Harvard Business School.

00:00:39.905 --> 00:00:42.320
I was a student not in the business school,

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.180
but in the physics department at the time.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.250
I was getting my PhD in Mathematical Physics,

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.245
but I audited Merton's class and I learned

00:00:51.245 --> 00:00:55.835
that some very advanced and interesting mathematics was actually involved in finance.

00:00:55.835 --> 00:01:00.860
The field is now fascinating to me as a former mathematician,

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.460
a former mathematical physicist because for one thing,

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.770
it's something that nearly everyone cares about.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.995
Almost everyone has some connection to the financial markets,

00:01:09.995 --> 00:01:13.540
even if it's just casually following the stock market.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.980
Yet, some of the most successful investors in

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.160
history are actually mathematicians and physicists,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.230
and apply very interesting,

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.305
very deep mathematics to the markets.

00:01:23.305 --> 00:01:27.110
So is the mathematical side one of the things that

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.685
continues to pique your interest in the field?

00:01:31.685 --> 00:01:33.140
Yes, absolutely.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.030
We continue to find interesting

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.290
and challenging mathematics problems as we go along the way.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.265
So what was your path into your current career?

00:01:43.265 --> 00:01:48.755
Well, after taking Merton's course in my last year of graduate school,

00:01:48.755 --> 00:01:52.985
I applied for quantitative positions in hedge funds.

00:01:52.985 --> 00:01:59.780
I also applied for academic post-doctoral fellowships as I wasn't entirely decided yet,

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.690
but my original plan had always been to pursue a career in

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.935
academia and it was hard to let go of that.

00:02:06.935 --> 00:02:11.555
So I also applied to post-doctoral fellowships,

00:02:11.555 --> 00:02:16.570
which in academia is a path towards a tenure track faculty position,

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.220
and I was offered some of each kind of jobs.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.200
So I was offered some postdocs,

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.990
some quantitative analyst or quantitative strategists positions in hedge funds,

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.180
and I had to make an agonizing decision because I couldn't do both at the same time.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.310
In the end, I think it was the right decision,

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.940
and fast forward to today,

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.700
I'm fortunate enough to have a position in the industry where I get to

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.910
lead a dual life as a practitioner and an academic.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.270
So this way, I think of it as the

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.185
best of both worlds and I get to do something that has a big impact in industry.

00:02:51.185 --> 00:02:54.290
But I also never truly had to disconnect from the job that

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.040
I had always prepared for as a young person and always thought I would do,

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.050
which was the job of a professor.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.680
What advice would you give to someone just starting a career in finance,

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.355
and what are some common misconceptions of people just starting out?

00:03:07.355 --> 00:03:11.225
Great question. I think if you're looking to start a career in finance,

00:03:11.225 --> 00:03:14.090
you should first of all do it because you love finance.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.790
So for example, if you find yourself reading

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.730
the Journal of Finance in your spare time because maybe that's, to you,

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.835
more interesting and fun than the latest video game or something else you do for fun,

00:03:25.835 --> 00:03:29.855
that would be a good indication that a career in finance is the right choice for you.

00:03:29.855 --> 00:03:32.180
One of the misconceptions of those starting out in

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.345
finance and in quantitative finance in particular,

00:03:35.345 --> 00:03:41.240
is that it's easy or that various easy things have not been tried yet.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.760
In my experience, some of the best mathematical minds in

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.490
finance are among some of the best mathematicians in the world.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.245
Period. Full stop.

00:03:48.245 --> 00:03:50.090
How important is knowledge in

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.115
different subject areas like math and accounting, for example?

00:03:54.115 --> 00:03:58.070
Knowledge in those subject areas is very important, Liz.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.930
One that also gets overlooked,

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.285
I think, is knowledge in computer science.

00:04:02.285 --> 00:04:04.340
I think knowledge of computer science is

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.895
absolutely crucial in modern quantitative finance.

00:04:06.895 --> 00:04:10.730
Occasionally, I encounter someone who wants to do quantitative finance,

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.550
but who has no concept of real computer programming

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.990
beyond a little bit of some simple scripting language.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:21.320
Most of the really good quantitative traders I know would easily handle

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.495
a programming interview at an elite Silicon Valley firm in Java or C++,

00:04:26.495 --> 00:04:28.850
but they chose finance because that

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.595
was just what interested them and what they really love.

00:04:31.595 --> 00:04:35.155
Gordon, how important is background knowledge in accounting?

00:04:35.155 --> 00:04:37.040
Well, I think very important,

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.960
and this is something that's often overlooked.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.895
You can get a PhD in accounting.

00:04:40.895 --> 00:04:43.940
If you look at many of the top business schools,

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.350
such as Columbia Business School,

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.010
offer a PhD in accounting where you can study value

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.750
investing for five or six years and write a PhD thesis on it.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.185
This is knowledge that takes a long time to acquire.

00:04:57.185 --> 00:04:59.000
You can make a career studying it.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.020
This is important knowledge for deciding what a company is really worth.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.615
What are the best ways to develop key skills,

00:05:05.615 --> 00:05:08.950
especially if you don't have a degree from a name-brand school?

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.020
I think one of the best ways to develop key skills is by trying

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.530
things out on your own and finding out what works.

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.710
So to take an analogy from computer science.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.225
Computer Programmers often call this hacking in the positive sense of the term,

00:05:23.225 --> 00:05:26.000
of just getting in front of a computer and writing

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.375
some code and eventually learning what works and what doesn't.

00:05:29.375 --> 00:05:32.600
I think one of the purposes of our projects here is to

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.555
get people to try to do that with some financial data.

00:05:35.555 --> 00:05:38.810
What do people in finance mean by market intuition,

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.780
and what's the best way to develop it?

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.920
I think some people coming from

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.060
quantitative fields tend to think of a market as this huge dataset.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.030
In actual fact, the market is a mechanism by which

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.690
trade is affected among people and corporations,

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.150
which are ultimately composed of people, anyway.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.530
One starts of thinking,

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:58.880
well, who are those people?

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.170
Why are they trading?

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.770
What are the economic forces driving their trading decisions?

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.785
At the end of the day, if your algorithm is looking at a data point,

00:06:06.785 --> 00:06:12.715
what is the actual meaning in the real world of that piece of data?

00:06:12.715 --> 00:06:15.995
So to develop that knowledge and intuition,

00:06:15.995 --> 00:06:17.525
I think you have to do two things.

00:06:17.525 --> 00:06:19.040
So on the one hand,

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.980
you should study finance and economics.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:27.425
For example, a PhD in finance or accounting or financial economics is great for that,

00:06:27.425 --> 00:06:29.930
or if you don't have time to get a PhD,

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.960
at very least study those things on your own.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.955
On the other hand, I think you have to also watch the markets for

00:06:34.955 --> 00:06:37.550
a long time to see how those theories of

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.480
economic behavior are actually put into practice.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.415
So it's not an easy or a short path,

00:06:43.415 --> 00:06:47.630
which is why I also say it has to be something that you love intrinsically.

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.600
What general practices, attitudes,

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.980
or habits are most important to being successful in your field?

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.600
Well, I view investing as a science.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.180
So I think if you look at good scientists in any field of science,

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.070
and in particular in the science of investing, well,

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.450
they should be skeptical and they should

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:11.930
be very rigorous in applying the scientific method.

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.300
Experiments should be clear about

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.350
what models or what hypotheses those experiments are testing.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:23.860
The experimental results need to be analyzed using proper statistical methods.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.550
Beyond that, I think I can best answer this with an anecdote or an example.

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.130
So one of the best quantitative traders I've ever

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:34.835
known was someone who did not have a PhD,

00:07:34.835 --> 00:07:37.460
but he loves to take things apart and understand

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.040
how they work using scientific principles.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:44.285
He can fix almost anything with a circuit in it from a toaster to an airplane,

00:07:44.285 --> 00:07:49.265
and he in fact, he used to work as an engineer on something involving satellites.

00:07:49.265 --> 00:07:53.405
It's almost impossible to convince him of something that is in fact false,

00:07:53.405 --> 00:07:55.880
and he tries to see the world as it really is,

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.670
not as what we would want it to be.

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:00.890
That comes through in building models.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:02.600
Because if you fit something,

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.090
just some training data and it appears to fit very well,

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:08.450
we'd all like to believe that we found the next great model,

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:11.030
but it may simply have been overfit.

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:15.130
So what has to come into play is a desire to see things as they are.

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:18.620
What do you find most rewarding about working in your field?

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:21.260
The thing I love most about working in finance is that

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.170
the work itself is intellectual and fun,

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.050
while at the same time having real-world consequences

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:30.635
that I can see quickly having an impact in the real world.

00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:34.100
Another thing I really like is just the people that you meet along the way.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.840
A lot of interesting,

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.510
curious characters in the best possible sense.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:40.685
Thanks Gordon so much for talking with me.

00:08:40.685 --> 00:08:42.500
I look forward to talking to you again.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.600
Well, thank you for having me. It's been a lot of fun.
