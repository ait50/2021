00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.784
You've been busy learning here,

00:00:01.784 --> 00:00:04.500
building up your knowledge and skills through your nanodegree work.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.935
But, what's actually happening inside your head to enable this growth?

00:00:07.934 --> 00:00:09.964
Well, each time you think about something,

00:00:09.964 --> 00:00:12.960
you activate particular neural pathways in your brain,

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.680
and that activation strengthens the pathways themselves.

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:17.024
As a simple example,

00:00:17.024 --> 00:00:19.199
if I just learned basic addition so that I can

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.839
figure out that three plus two equals five,

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:23.815
the more I do problems similar to this like,

00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:25.370
one plus six equals seven,

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.940
the easier it will be for me to remember how to add digits together.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.429
Essentially, we grow our knowledge and make it easier to

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:34.715
access the more we recall relevant information.

00:00:34.715 --> 00:00:37.340
Research also shows that applying new learning in

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.529
different contexts makes it even stronger,

00:00:39.529 --> 00:00:41.060
and it allows you to retain it better.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.940
So, if I move from problems like three plus two equals

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:47.119
five to trying out something like 4 plus 20, plus 1,

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:50.509
plus 6, I have the opportunity to apply my addition skills in

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:54.189
a new context with bigger numbers and more things to add up.

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:56.509
This will make my brain distill the core concepts

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:59.479
necessary for understanding how addition really works,

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:00.949
which means that in the future,

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.140
when faced with even trickier addition problems,

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.894
I'll have a strong foundation to tackle those challenges.

00:01:05.894 --> 00:01:09.015
This is exactly what we want to prepare you to do,

00:01:09.015 --> 00:01:10.959
albeit with much tougher problems.

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:14.000
Our job at Udacity is to help you build deep knowledge and

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.019
flexible skills that you can apply to all sorts of novel problems in the future.

00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:22.009
In order for that to happen your brain needs to actively engage with problems,

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.200
questions, and ideas that will push it to grow in the desired direction
