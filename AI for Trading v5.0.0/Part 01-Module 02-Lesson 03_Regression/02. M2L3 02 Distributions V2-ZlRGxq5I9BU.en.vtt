00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.379
Many statistical models assume that the data follows a normal distribution,

00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:09.330
also referred to as a Gaussian or a bell curve.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.050
This is important when checking whether our models are valid.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.140
There are various tests that we use to check

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.365
that our models describe a meaningful relationship.

00:00:19.364 --> 00:00:23.854
These tests assume that the data are normally distributed.

00:00:23.855 --> 00:00:26.560
If the data are not normally distributed,

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:32.204
then these tests tend to conclude that the model is valid when in fact it is not.

00:00:32.204 --> 00:00:34.949
We will review the concepts of normality,

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.075
show how to check for normality,

00:00:37.075 --> 00:00:42.335
and introduce some ways to transform our data so that they follow a normal distribution.

00:00:42.335 --> 00:00:44.875
What is a random variable?

00:00:44.875 --> 00:00:50.409
A random variable is a variable that can take on a random value.

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:53.419
The probability that the random variable takes

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.145
a particular value is determined by its probability distribution.

00:00:58.145 --> 00:01:01.820
You can think of a probability distribution as a range of

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.555
numbers each with a probability associated with it.

00:01:05.555 --> 00:01:07.595
With data from the real world,

00:01:07.594 --> 00:01:11.814
we don't actually know its underlying probability distribution.

00:01:11.814 --> 00:01:17.704
However, we can often approximate its probability distribution with an equation.

00:01:17.704 --> 00:01:21.189
If we say that a random variable is normally distributed,

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:23.700
how do we visualize what this means?

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.680
We can imagine the random variable as a tennis ball machine.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.590
This machine shoots tennis falls onto

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.880
a number line that ranges from negative infinity to infinity.

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:39.349
The number line has buckets of equal size placed on the line,

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:42.369
so that tennis balls will collect in these buckets.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.480
If the random variables distribution is centered around zero,

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.270
this means that tennis balls are more likely to hit the number line at zero,

00:01:51.269 --> 00:01:54.140
rather than say 500.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.709
If we shoot enough tennis balls along this number line,

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:01.444
then we end up with a hill shaped pile of tennis balls.

00:02:01.444 --> 00:02:04.864
This plot is called a histogram.

00:02:04.864 --> 00:02:09.799
A histogram resembles the shape of its probability distribution.
