00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.629
A probability distribution is defined in math by an equation.

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:10.259
We call this equation a probability density function or PDF.

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:14.195
For every number from negative infinity to infinity,

00:00:14.195 --> 00:00:19.815
the probability density function gives a probability that this number will be generated.

00:00:19.815 --> 00:00:23.940
Using math notation, X tilde D means

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.170
the random variable X follows a probability distribution D.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.905
The capital P with a lowercase x vertical bar and capital D

00:00:34.905 --> 00:00:40.549
is read as the probability of x given D. So,

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:44.854
what does it mean when we say the probability of x given D?

00:00:44.854 --> 00:00:49.494
Let's say we have a number two that we observed from a dataset.

00:00:49.494 --> 00:00:52.039
We assume that the dataset follows

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.685
a particular probability distribution such as the normal distribution.

00:00:56.685 --> 00:01:03.484
The equation P of x tells us how likely the random variable would take on the value two.

00:01:03.484 --> 00:01:09.515
This P of x outputs a number between zero and one which represents this probability.

00:01:09.515 --> 00:01:15.385
For instance, here is the standard normal distribution written as a fancy-looking capital

00:01:15.385 --> 00:01:22.435
N. The standard normal distribution has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one,

00:01:22.435 --> 00:01:26.600
but what if you had a distribution that was not centered around zero?

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:32.394
Or, what if you had a distribution that had a flatter wider distribution?

00:01:32.394 --> 00:01:35.149
These distributions can still be modeled by

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.300
the same equation by adjusting its parameters.

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.480
To describe these variations of the normal distribution,

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.939
we can adjust two of its parameters.

00:01:43.938 --> 00:01:48.604
Calculate the mean of the data and assign that value to mu.

00:01:48.605 --> 00:01:53.060
Calculate the standard deviation and assign it to sigma.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.730
The resulting function approximates the distribution of our data.
