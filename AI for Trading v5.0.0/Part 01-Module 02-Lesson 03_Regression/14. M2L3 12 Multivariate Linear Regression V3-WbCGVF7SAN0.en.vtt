00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.399
Earlier, we touched on using

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.945
multiple independent variables to predict a single dependent variable.

00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:09.599
We call this multiple regression.

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.044
In this example, we are using a house's area,

00:00:13.044 --> 00:00:17.265
number of rooms and number of years since the house was built.

00:00:17.265 --> 00:00:21.725
All three are variables that we use to predict the house price.

00:00:21.725 --> 00:00:24.540
We can go one step further and choose

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.379
more than one dependent variable that we wish to predict.

00:00:28.379 --> 00:00:31.744
Now, we're not just predicting the house price,

00:00:31.745 --> 00:00:36.704
but also trying to predict the home's electricity consumption and gas consumption.

00:00:36.704 --> 00:00:41.750
When we tried to predict more than one dependent variable at the same time,

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.670
this is called multivariate regression.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.929
When we're using more than one independent variable

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:51.219
to predict more than one dependent variable,

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.314
this is called multivariate multiple regression.

00:00:55.314 --> 00:00:57.469
This appears rather complicated,

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.920
but being familiar with multivariate regression will help

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.930
you later when you learn about time series and pairs trading.
