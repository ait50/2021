00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.410
Recall that we also need to check if our data is stationary over time.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.400
By stationary, we mean that the mean,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.515
variance, and covariance are the same over time.

00:00:12.515 --> 00:00:18.255
In particular, we want to check that the variance of our data is stable over time.

00:00:18.254 --> 00:00:22.519
This is important because if the variance changes over time,

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:26.719
then the tests that we use to validate our model will be incorrect.

00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:31.759
The term for constant variance over time is homoscedasticity.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.250
The term for a changing variance over time is heteroskedasticity.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.685
To check if our data is homoscedastic or heteroskedastic,

00:00:41.685 --> 00:00:44.410
we can use the Breusch-Pagan test.

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:46.449
If the Breusch-Pagan test,

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.505
yields a small P value,

00:00:48.505 --> 00:00:51.020
say less than 0.05,

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.175
then we have to assume that the data is heteroskedastic.

00:00:55.174 --> 00:01:00.204
If the Breusch-Pagan test yields a P value greater than 0.05,

00:01:00.204 --> 00:01:03.729
we can assume that the data is homoscedastic.
