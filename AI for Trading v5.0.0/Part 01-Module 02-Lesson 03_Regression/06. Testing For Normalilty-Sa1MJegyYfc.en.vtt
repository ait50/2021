00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.894
We've just seen how to model our data if we assume that it is normally distributed.

00:00:05.894 --> 00:00:08.490
But how do we decide if our data can be

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.530
described by a normal distribution in the first place?

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:13.649
A quick way to visually check,

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.045
is to plot a histogram of our data.

00:00:16.045 --> 00:00:20.540
We can then compare the histogram to a plot of the normal distribution.

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.244
Does this data's distribution look normal?

00:00:23.245 --> 00:00:25.285
How about this one?

00:00:25.285 --> 00:00:29.210
Does it look like we can still describe it with a normal distribution?

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.115
We can also use a boxplot to check for normality.

00:00:33.115 --> 00:00:34.660
As you'll soon see,

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:38.209
the boxplot helps to check for symmetry in your data.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.740
Normal distributions are symmetric around their mean.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.775
Here is a boxplot.

00:00:43.774 --> 00:00:46.469
There is a box with a line inside.

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.484
The bottom edge of the box,

00:00:48.484 --> 00:00:50.089
the middle line in the box,

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.590
and the top edge of the box,

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.135
are quantiles that divide the data in two groups.

00:00:55.134 --> 00:00:58.724
We call the dividing lines quantiles because

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:02.620
they split the data into groups with the same number of points.

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:06.200
Since the three dividing lines create four groups,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.795
we call these lines quartiles.

00:01:08.795 --> 00:01:12.489
Remember that the quartiles are the three dividing lines,

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:15.015
not the four groups themselves.

00:01:15.015 --> 00:01:18.364
The line inside the box is the median.

00:01:18.364 --> 00:01:22.429
If you ordered all of your dataset from smallest to largest,

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.255
50 percent of your data points are less than the median.

00:01:26.254 --> 00:01:30.454
The bottom side of the box represents the first quartile.

00:01:30.454 --> 00:01:35.105
Twenty five percent of the data are less than the first quartile.

00:01:35.105 --> 00:01:38.660
The top side of the box is the third quartile.

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.194
Seventy five percent of the data are less than the third quartile.

00:01:43.194 --> 00:01:48.179
We can calculate the interquartile range by taking the third quartile,

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.445
minus the first quartile.

00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:54.189
The boxplot has small lines on either end.

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.914
We call these lines whiskers.

00:01:56.915 --> 00:02:01.049
The lower bound whisker is defined as the first quartile,

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.485
minus 1.5 times the interquartile range.

00:02:05.484 --> 00:02:10.699
Similarly, the upper bound whisker is set to the third quartile,

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:15.079
plus 1.5 times the interquartile range.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.515
Points lying outside of the whiskers can be considered

00:02:18.514 --> 00:02:22.844
outliers and are visualized as individual points.

00:02:22.844 --> 00:02:25.590
Going back to our test for normality,

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.120
if you look at the normal distribution, it is symmetric.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.200
When a distribution is symmetric,

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:33.889
it's median is equal to it's mean.

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:39.609
The first quartile and third quartile are also the same distance away from the median.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.045
Also, the whiskers are the same distance away from the median.

00:02:44.044 --> 00:02:46.734
By visualizing your data with a boxplot,

00:02:46.735 --> 00:02:49.220
you can see whether it's symmetric or not.

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:51.008
If it's not symmetric,

00:02:51.008 --> 00:02:53.114
it's not normally distributed.

00:02:53.115 --> 00:02:58.080
We can look at the data using both a box whisker plot and a histogram.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.855
Here, it looks like it follows a normal distribution.

00:03:01.854 --> 00:03:04.864
This other dataset is not normal.

00:03:04.865 --> 00:03:08.719
In fact, we say that it is skewed because it has

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:13.099
a long tail of data to only one side of the distribution.

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:16.314
When there is a long tail of data to the left,

00:03:16.314 --> 00:03:20.204
the mean of the distribution lies to the left of the median.

00:03:20.205 --> 00:03:23.905
We say that the distribution is left skewed.

00:03:23.905 --> 00:03:29.655
In fact, stock returns tend to exhibit left skew and fat tails.

00:03:29.655 --> 00:03:33.469
This means that extreme negative returns occur with

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:37.805
greater frequency than would be expected by a normal distribution.

00:03:37.805 --> 00:03:41.240
Please note that even if your data is symmetric,

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.500
it's not necessarily a bell-shaped curve of a normal distribution.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.530
So, it helps to see the box whisker plot,

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.474
as well as the histogram.

00:03:50.474 --> 00:03:53.129
To do a more thorough check for normality,

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:55.629
we can use a QQ plot.

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:59.134
The QQ plot checks if the shape of the data

00:03:59.134 --> 00:04:02.769
matches the shape of our probability density function.

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.125
The first Q in QQ plot stands for quantile.

00:04:07.125 --> 00:04:11.789
The second Q in QQ plot also stands for quantile.

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:17.449
Common quantiles are quartiles, deciles, and percentiles.

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:21.784
Recall that when we sort the data points from smallest to largest,

00:04:21.785 --> 00:04:27.660
we can find boundaries that divide the data into groups with equal number of points.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.930
If we divide a data into 10 buckets,

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.264
the nine boundaries are deciles.

00:04:34.264 --> 00:04:37.774
If we divide the data into 100 buckets,

00:04:37.774 --> 00:04:41.724
the 99 boundaries are called percentiles.

00:04:41.725 --> 00:04:46.140
Notice, that this is not the same as plotting a histogram.

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:50.329
With a histogram, the buckets have the same width.

00:04:50.329 --> 00:04:55.229
With quantiles, the buckets all have the same number of data points.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:01.444
QQ plots let us compare any two distributions to check if they have the same shape.

00:05:01.444 --> 00:05:05.819
Since we want to check if a data is shaped like a normal distribution,

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:11.009
we can plot it's quantiles against the quantiles of a normal distribution.

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:17.360
As an example, let's take the 50th percentile of our data as our y-coordinate.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.810
Next, we take the 50th percentile of

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.435
the standard normal distribution as our x-coordinate.

00:05:24.435 --> 00:05:28.134
We plot this xy point on the QQ plot.

00:05:28.134 --> 00:05:31.969
We repeat this for all the other percentiles.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.360
If the two distributions have the same shape,

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.639
then the plotted points will follow

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.519
a straight line that goes from the bottom left to the top right.

00:05:41.519 --> 00:05:43.064
In this QQ plot,

00:05:43.064 --> 00:05:46.660
we can see that the data does not look like a normal distribution.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:52.015
This is because the plotted points form a curve instead of a straight line.

00:05:52.014 --> 00:05:58.029
So far, we've seen plots that help us visually check if our data looks like it's normal.

00:05:58.029 --> 00:06:03.754
What if we wanted a single number to represent how normal the data is?

00:06:03.754 --> 00:06:05.954
If we had a single number,

00:06:05.954 --> 00:06:08.319
we could choose a cutoff point.

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:11.259
Anything on one side of this cutoff point,

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:13.330
and we decide that it's normal.

00:06:13.329 --> 00:06:16.209
Anything on the other side of the cutoff point,

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:18.685
and we decide that it's not normal.

00:06:18.685 --> 00:06:23.069
The Shapiro-Wilk test and the D'Augustino-Pearson tests,

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:26.860
are hypotheses tests that give a p-value.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.085
The p-value ranges from zero to one.

00:06:30.084 --> 00:06:32.739
These are hypotheses tests in which

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.775
the null hypothesis assumes that the data is normally distributed.

00:06:36.774 --> 00:06:41.114
If the p-value is larger than 0.05,

00:06:41.115 --> 00:06:44.735
then we will assume that it follows a normal distribution.

00:06:44.735 --> 00:06:48.105
If the p-value is less than 0.05,

00:06:48.105 --> 00:06:51.275
then it likely does not follow a normal distribution.

00:06:51.274 --> 00:06:54.139
There is a another more general test to decide

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:57.274
whether any two distributions are the same.

00:06:57.274 --> 00:07:02.419
This test is called the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:08.715
Given two distributions, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test returns a p-value.

00:07:08.714 --> 00:07:12.274
If the p-value is greater than 0.05,

00:07:12.274 --> 00:07:16.084
we will assume that the two distributions are the same.

00:07:16.084 --> 00:07:19.469
If the p-value is less than 0.05,

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.935
then we say the two distributions are not the same.

00:07:22.935 --> 00:07:26.915
Remember the reason why we care about the data being normal.

00:07:26.915 --> 00:07:30.615
When we use statistical models such as regression,

00:07:30.615 --> 00:07:36.074
we use hypotheses tests to check if we can trust the model parameters of the model.

00:07:36.074 --> 00:07:39.939
These tests assume that our data is normally distributed.

00:07:39.939 --> 00:07:42.879
If the data are not normally distributed,

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:49.069
these tests tend to tell us that our model is valid when in fact it is not.
