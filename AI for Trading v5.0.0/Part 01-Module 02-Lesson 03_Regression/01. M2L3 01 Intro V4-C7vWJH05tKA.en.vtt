00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.969
This lesson focuses on two main concepts.

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:06.339
1. Checking if your data fits a normal distribution.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.350
2. Checking if your data is

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.080
stationary over time and what to do in

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:14.309
both cases when they're not. 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:16.929
To understand regression which we will

00:00:17.129 --> 00:00:19.379
build upon later in time series analysis

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:22.749
when using regression, we choose one or

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.850
more independent variables to help us

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.149
predict a dependent variable. 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.659
Independent variables may include market indices,

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.689
employment numbers, weather forecasts or

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.179
consumer spending reports. 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.399
Dependent variables include stock price returns,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.009
but may also include electricity

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.018
consumption or the amount of corn harvested.

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.049
You can also choose stocks

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.419
returns as both your independent and

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:52.899
dependent variables in a regression. 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.849
At first glance it looks like you're using

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:57.489
the returns of one stock to predict the

00:00:57.689 --> 00:01:00.518
returns of another stock. In fact the

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.128
regression is used to see how two assets

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.399
or two groups of assets move in relation

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:09.129
to each other. This is what we do in

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:12.250
statistical arbitrage. Statistical

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.590
arbitrage is a trading technique that

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.049
involves simultaneously buying and

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.469
selling two related assets based on the

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.319
analysis of how these two assets move in

00:01:23.519 --> 00:01:25.899
relation to one another. It's important

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:27.399
to keep in mind the signal-to-noise

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:30.878
ratio in our data. The signal is the

00:01:31.078 --> 00:01:33.278
meaningful part of our input data that

00:01:33.478 --> 00:01:35.459
helps us predict our dependent variable.

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.009
The noise is the random part of our data

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:40.959
that does not help us make better

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.198
predictions. With financial data, the

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.929
signal is relatively low and there is a

00:01:47.129 --> 00:01:49.480
lot of noise. In other words, the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.439
signal-to-noise ratio tends to be low.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.289
When the signal-to-noise ratio is low,

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:57.969
predictive models tend to overfit the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.698
data that it's trained on. This means

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.768
that when the model is used to make

00:02:02.968 --> 00:02:05.619
forecasts in real life, they often pay

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:07.750
too much attention to aspects of the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.088
data that are not actually useful in

00:02:10.288 --> 00:02:11.189
prediction.

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:13.740
This results in predictions that are not

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:15.560
accurate enough to be useful.

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:18.689
Moreover the relationship between the

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:20.460
independent variables and the stock

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.640
returns can change over time. In other

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.830
words, their relationships are not

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.219
stationary in practice. This means that

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:31.439
your models become stale after some time

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:34.050
and need to be periodically retrained

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.050
with more recent data. This also means

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.120
that some independent variables that

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.520
produced useful predictive signals in

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:44.460
the past may not necessarily do so in

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:48.030
the future and vice-versa. This is partly

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:50.340
why a certain trading strategies fade

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:52.980
after a while and become useful again in

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.180
the future.
