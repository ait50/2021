00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.044
So, how is regression used in stock trading?

00:00:03.044 --> 00:00:06.839
In practice, using regression to predict a stock's return is

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.995
difficult because the signal and financial data is low compared to the noise.

00:00:11.994 --> 00:00:16.835
Moreover, the models are sensitive to some choices you make about the model.

00:00:16.835 --> 00:00:20.700
For instance, you'll have to decide how much of your previous data to

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.035
use since more recent data is more relevant than very old data.

00:00:26.035 --> 00:00:30.149
Regression models are pretty sensitive to these design choices.

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:33.868
Regression is also sensitive to outliers in the data,

00:00:33.868 --> 00:00:36.509
as it adds more noise to the training data.

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:42.295
However, there are still important reasons to learn regression to analyze stock returns.

00:00:42.295 --> 00:00:45.575
Learning regression is useful because we can apply

00:00:45.575 --> 00:00:49.580
the same regression techniques to analyze time-series data.

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.170
Time series analysis looks at data that is collected at regular intervals

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.715
over time and uses that to predict its value in the near future.

00:00:58.715 --> 00:01:01.890
One more note about why regression is important to learn,

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.170
if we learn the details of how neural networks work,

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.495
many of the same principles apply.

00:01:08.495 --> 00:01:12.859
In fact, if we think of regression as a fundamental building block,

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:18.439
then a neural network is a building that is composed of many regression building blocks.
