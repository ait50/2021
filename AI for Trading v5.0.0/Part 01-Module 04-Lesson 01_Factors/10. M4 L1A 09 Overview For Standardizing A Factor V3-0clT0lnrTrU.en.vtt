00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.429
So, let's revisit the steps we take to convert factor values into

00:00:04.429 --> 00:00:09.625
portfolio weights in a dollar neutral portfolio with a leverage ratio of one.

00:00:09.625 --> 00:00:13.615
To make the factor represent weights of a dollar neutral portfolio,

00:00:13.615 --> 00:00:15.925
de-mean the vector of values.

00:00:15.925 --> 00:00:19.525
Do this by subtracting the average from each value.

00:00:19.524 --> 00:00:24.375
To make the factor represent a portfolio with leverage ratio of one,

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:30.184
re-scale the vector of values so that the sum of absolute values equals one.

00:00:30.184 --> 00:00:32.394
All right, I've talked enough.

00:00:32.395 --> 00:00:35.800
Let's give you a chance to practice coding up a factor.
