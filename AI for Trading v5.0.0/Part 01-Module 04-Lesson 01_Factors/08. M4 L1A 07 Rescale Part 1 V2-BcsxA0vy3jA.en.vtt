00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.490
Okay. Now, let's get an idea for why we

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:08.144
re-scale the weights so that the sum of the absolute values equals one.

00:00:08.144 --> 00:00:13.875
Our goal is for the portfolio's leverage ratio to be equal to one.

00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:17.280
So, let's first discuss the concept of leverage,

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.655
and then we'll learn about what the leverage ratio is.

00:00:20.655 --> 00:00:25.390
Leverage is the act of borrowing in order to invest in assets.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.410
Usually, the goal when using leverage is

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.785
to potentially increase the return on investment.

00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:36.215
Leverage is related to the word leverage as used in physics.

00:00:36.215 --> 00:00:39.215
You can think of a lever resting on a fulcrum.

00:00:39.215 --> 00:00:43.010
If you push the short side of the lever down by one meter,

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:46.454
the long side will move by more than one meter.

00:00:46.454 --> 00:00:48.655
For a long/short portfolio,

00:00:48.655 --> 00:00:51.920
the money that is borrowed for leverage can come from borrowing

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.210
cash and also from taking short positions in stocks.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.594
Recall that to take a short position,

00:00:58.594 --> 00:01:00.799
we borrow an asset and sell it in

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:04.364
the market with a promise of buying it back in the future.

00:01:04.364 --> 00:01:06.859
We can use the cash received from

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:11.289
these short positions in order to buy other stocks in the portfolio.

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:15.085
Without leverage, if we invested in a stock,

00:01:15.084 --> 00:01:18.319
then a 10 percent change in the stock price would lead to

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:23.104
a 10 percent change relative to our initial invested capital.

00:01:23.105 --> 00:01:28.409
With leverage, if we borrowed cash to double our initial investment,

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.700
then a 10 percent change in the stock price will lead to

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.135
a 20 percent increase relative to our initial capital.

00:01:36.135 --> 00:01:39.540
Let's look at an example without leverage.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.035
Pretend that we have $100,000 as initial capital.

00:01:44.034 --> 00:01:47.129
If the stock price increases by 10 percent,

00:01:47.129 --> 00:01:50.314
then the portfolio gains $10,000.

00:01:50.314 --> 00:01:52.534
Relative to the initial capital,

00:01:52.534 --> 00:01:55.619
the investment increased 10 percent.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.145
Now, let's look at a scenario where we use leverage.

00:01:59.144 --> 00:02:03.129
Start with $100,000 of initial capital.

00:02:03.129 --> 00:02:06.299
Borrow 100,000 in cash.

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.844
Use the 200,000 in cash to invest in the stock.

00:02:10.844 --> 00:02:13.629
If the stock increases by 10 percent,

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:17.344
then the investment increases by $20,000.

00:02:17.344 --> 00:02:20.840
Relative to the initial capital of 100,000,

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.069
this is actually an increase of 20 percent.

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.900
Since the potential investment percent gain of

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.800
20 percent is greater than the stock price gain of 10 percent,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.515
we say that this position is leveraged.

00:02:33.514 --> 00:02:37.399
