00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.625
Well, you made it.

00:00:02.625 --> 00:00:04.500
Made what?

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.480
Made it to the,

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.925
in my opinion, best part of the term.

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:11.130
This is where it all comes to life.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.075
That's part of the term but they've already learned so much good stuff.

00:00:15.074 --> 00:00:17.684
They've already created their own trading strategies

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:20.519
and they're already developing strong market intuition.

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.000
They have an idea for how quant research works and

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.554
how production quality, trading strategies work.

00:00:25.554 --> 00:00:27.359
They know about markets, volatility,

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.548
outliers, indices and ETFs.

00:00:29.548 --> 00:00:32.640
They even know how to create optimal diverse portfolios,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.549
trading off volatility or risk with return.

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:38.969
Yeah, that's true, and learning all of those things help bring them to

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.409
the point where they can fully appreciate what they're doing now.

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:45.199
But now we're going to put it all together and they're

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.260
finally going to see the whole process end to end,

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:50.104
from an initial hypothesis,

00:00:50.104 --> 00:00:51.804
maybe from an academic paper,

00:00:51.804 --> 00:00:56.140
we'll see a few real life examples to quantify non-hypothesis,

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.424
to combining information of many types from many sources

00:01:00.424 --> 00:01:05.090
about drivers of mean returns and drivers of volatility into a single model.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.840
Then using optimization tools we've already introduced,

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.584
to turn that into a production quality,

00:01:11.584 --> 00:01:16.689
theoretical tradable portfolio ready for a barrage of further testing.

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:19.004
Well you certainly have my attention.

00:01:19.004 --> 00:01:21.284
Is this how real quants do it?

00:01:21.284 --> 00:01:24.929
Absolutely. This is how real quants do it.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.850
Well, that's exciting.

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:30.664
Wait, when you mentioned ways to quantify a hypothesis,

00:01:30.665 --> 00:01:33.065
are you referring to the alphas that we discussed

00:01:33.064 --> 00:01:35.780
back when we were talking about the quantum workflow?

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.745
Yep. That's exactly right.

00:01:37.745 --> 00:01:40.555
We're going to talk about alphas in great detail.

00:01:40.555 --> 00:01:45.185
Okay. So, students are going to hear about all of these in these lessons.

00:01:45.185 --> 00:01:47.674
But will they get hands-on experience to?

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:50.814
Absolutely, your final project for this term,

00:01:50.814 --> 00:01:55.009
will give you a chance to demonstrate your understanding of this whole process.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.570
Frankly, I'm excited that you'll have a chance to learn about these fundamental tools.

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:02.569
I actually don't know of anywhere else where you can find

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:05.884
this kind of practical instruction in these methods.

00:02:05.885 --> 00:02:09.950
In this lesson, you'll get an inside view of how practitioners translate

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:14.469
ideas into alpha models and then implement those alpha models in code.

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:19.745
Personally, I'm also very excited that Jonathan has designed this module to give you

00:02:19.745 --> 00:02:22.939
a real practitioner's perspective of how to combine

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:26.719
data with an idea and implement it in code.

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:28.849
Yep, this is awesome.

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.949
We're all super excited that you've reached

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:33.439
this point in your journey with us and we hope you are too.

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:36.240
Without further ado, let's get started.
