00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.975
Any theoretical dollar neutral portfolio,

00:00:02.975 --> 00:00:06.845
we technically wouldn't be using any cash to create the positions.

00:00:06.844 --> 00:00:09.705
In fact, sometimes, in academic papers,

00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:13.980
they call these portfolios, zero investment portfolios.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.080
In real life, there are transaction costs,

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:19.664
margin costs for shorting positions,

00:00:19.664 --> 00:00:21.980
and differences in timing of trades.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.945
For the theoretical portfolio used to evaluate a factor,

00:00:25.945 --> 00:00:28.149
let's not worry about those issues.

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:34.128
So, now, let's visualize how we convert a portfolio into a dollar neutral portfolio.

00:00:34.128 --> 00:00:37.219
Let's say we have some portfolio weights and

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.354
want to adjust them so that they are dollar neutral.

00:00:40.354 --> 00:00:44.489
For example, let's say we have two stocks in the portfolio,

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.645
the weights are both positive,

00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:49.359
so the portfolio is not dollar neutral.

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:54.340
If you imagine the weights as actual weights on a balancing scale,

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.425
the scale would be tilting because it's heavier

00:00:57.424 --> 00:01:01.129
on the positive side compared to the negative side.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.950
Notice that the relative difference between

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.909
these two stocks is the weight of A minus the weight of B.

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.859
Keep this in mind for what's coming next.

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:15.825
If we were to shift the weights to the left towards the negative direction,

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:18.954
we can keep going until the weights are balanced.

00:01:18.954 --> 00:01:21.679
Notice that the relative difference between

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.050
the weights of the two stocks is still the same.

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.504
So, how did we shift our weights to make the portfolio dollar neutral?

00:01:29.504 --> 00:01:32.209
Well, we actually took the average of

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:36.214
the weights and then subtracted that average from each of the weights.

00:01:36.215 --> 00:01:38.680
Does this look familiar to you?

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.785
Subtracting the mean of the weights,

00:01:40.784 --> 00:01:43.179
D means the portfolio weights.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.355
The sum of the resulting weights now equals zero.

00:01:46.355 --> 00:01:49.200
So, the portfolio is dollar neutral.
