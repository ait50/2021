00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.450
At first glance, leverage looks awesome because if we take enough short positions,

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.155
we could technically have enough cash to pay for all of our long positions.

00:00:10.154 --> 00:00:13.514
But does this mean that more leverage is always better?

00:00:13.515 --> 00:00:16.905
Unfortunately, the answer is no.

00:00:16.905 --> 00:00:19.690
If the stock price went down 10 percent,

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.250
then our leveraged position would go down 20 percent,

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.820
which is greater than the loss we'd incur without leverage.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.344
So, as the saying goes,

00:00:29.344 --> 00:00:31.829
there's no such thing as a free lunch.

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.589
Which means that the benefits of leverage come at a cost.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.330
Using leverage can increase

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.479
our potential gain but can also increase our potential losses.

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:49.354
A useful measure of the amount of leverage in a portfolio is the leverage ratio.

00:00:49.354 --> 00:00:51.134
In terms of dollars,

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:55.094
if we added up the magnitudes of the long and short positions,

00:00:55.094 --> 00:00:57.835
and divided that sum by the notional,

00:00:57.835 --> 00:01:00.590
this would be the leverage ratio.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.314
For example, if a portfolio had a notional or initial capital

00:01:05.314 --> 00:01:10.230
of $1 million and had $1 million in long positions,

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.755
the leverage ratio would be one.

00:01:12.754 --> 00:01:15.289
If the portfolio had the same notional of

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.350
1 million but borrowed cash to go long two million positions,

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:24.584
its leverage ratio would be two million divided by one million or two.

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:27.469
If the portfolio had long positions totaling

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:31.879
$1 million and short positions also totaling $1 million,

00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:38.594
then the leverage ratio would also be two million divided by one million, which is two.

00:01:38.594 --> 00:01:42.569
If the longs were two million and the shorts were two million,

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:45.774
then the leverage ratio would be four.

00:01:45.775 --> 00:01:49.370
So, I hope you noticed that the more positions we take

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.230
and absolute magnitude relative to the initial capital,

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.920
the higher the leverage ratio.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.269
For theoretical portfolio, that's used for analyzing a factor,

00:02:00.269 --> 00:02:03.049
we assume a $1 notional.

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.590
We add up the sum of the absolute values of the weights,

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.240
then divide by the $1 notional to calculate the leverage ratio.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.820
Dividing by one doesn't change the sum.

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.340
So, we can skip the division.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.594
For example, if we had three stocks in the portfolio with weights of negative 0.5,

00:02:22.594 --> 00:02:26.599
positive 0.3, and positive 0.2,

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.319
the sum of their absolute values is one.

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.189
So, the leverage ratio is also one.

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:33.995
If on the other hand,

00:02:33.995 --> 00:02:37.055
the portfolio had weights of negative one,

00:02:37.055 --> 00:02:41.020
positive 0.6, and positive 0.4,

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.040
then the sum of their absolute values is two.

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:47.174
So, the leverage ratio is also two.

00:02:47.175 --> 00:02:49.305
Let's revisit our goal,

00:02:49.305 --> 00:02:51.515
which was to rescale portfolio weights,

00:02:51.514 --> 00:02:54.414
so that we have a leverage ratio of one.

00:02:54.414 --> 00:02:57.319
To do this, we can sum up the absolute values of

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.419
the weights and divide each of our original weights by this sum.

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:03.209
By doing this division,

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:09.840
we are re-scaling the factor values so that the sum of their magnitudes equals one.
