00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.500
And the answer is this guy is closer these guys over her are closer.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.750
And the way to see this is you can make a line between the cluster centers and

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.890
then draw an equidistant and orthogonal line and that

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.270
line separate the space into a half space that's closer to center number one,

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.380
which is the one over here, and a half space that's closer to center number two,

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.800
which is the space over here.
