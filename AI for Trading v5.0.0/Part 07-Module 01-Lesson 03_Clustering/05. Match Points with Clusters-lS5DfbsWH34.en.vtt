00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.510
In k-means, you randomly draw cluster centers and

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.600
say our first initial guess is, say, over here and over here.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.270
These are obviously not the correct cluster centers.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:11.300
You're not done yet.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.970
But k-means now operates in two steps.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.640
Step number is assign and step number two is optimize.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.340
So let's talk about the assignment.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.010
For classes in number one, I want you to click on exactly those of

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.030
the red points that you believe are closer to center one than center two.
