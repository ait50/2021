00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.480
So here's an example that should make it intuitively clear the clustering

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.560
sometimes make sense.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.900
So take Katie and me, we both have a movie collection at home.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.390
And just imagine that both of us look at each other's movies, and all movies,

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:20.034
and Katie gets to rank them from really, really bad to great.

00:00:20.034 --> 00:00:24.310
And I to get to rank the same movies from bad to great.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.600
Now it so turns out that Katie and I have very different tastes.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.720
Maybe some movies that I love, like all my James Bond movies, but

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.790
Katie doesn't like as much.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.680
And there's others or these chick flicks, that Katie loves, and I don't.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.720
So somewhat exaggerated.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.220
It mind end up, that our movies fall into different classes,

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.270
depending on who likes which movies.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.330
So say, say you're Netflix, and

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:57.010
and you look at both my queue and Katie's queue, and you graph it like that.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.010
Then you can conclude, wow, there's two different classes of movies.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.730
Without knowing anything else about movies,

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.270
you would say, here's class A and class B.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.640
And they're very different in characteristics.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.740
And the reason why Netflix might want to know this is next time Katie comes in,

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.080
you want to kind of propose a movie that fits into class B and on to class A.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.780
Otherwise, she's very unlikely to watch this movie.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.700
And conversely, for me, you want a reach into class A versus class B.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.800
In fact, if you were to look at those movies,

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.440
you might find that old style westerns are right over here.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.420
And modern chick flicks might be sitting over here.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.460
Who knows?

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.830
But that's an example of clustering.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.360
Because here, there's no target labels given.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.220
Then they move down for you if class A and B existed.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.360
But after looking at the data, you could,

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.160
through clustering, deduce as two different classes, and you could even look

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.660
at the movie titles to understand what these classes are all about.
