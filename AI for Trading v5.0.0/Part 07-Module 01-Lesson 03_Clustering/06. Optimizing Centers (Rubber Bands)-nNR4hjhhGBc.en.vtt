00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.630
So now we know that these four points correspond to

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.630
the present class center one that was randomly chosen.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:14.130
And these three points over here correspond to class center in the middle.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.200
That's the assignment step.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.910
obviously that's not good enough.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.780
Now we have to optimize.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:24.840
And what we are optimizing is, you are minimizing the total quadratic distance.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.610
Of our cluster center to the points.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.330
We're now free to move our cluster center.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.290
I think of these little blue lines over here as rubber bands, and

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.040
that we're trying to find the state of minimum energy for

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.490
the rubber bands, where the total quadratic error is minimized.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.760
And for the top one, I'm going to give you three positions.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.760
They're all approximate, but

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.990
pick the one that looks best in terms of minimization.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.640
And that's a not a trivial question at all.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.560
So one could be right over here, one could be at and

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.800
one could be right over here.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.730
Which one do you think best minimize, or is minimize of the three positions,

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.080
the total quadratic length of these rubber bands?
