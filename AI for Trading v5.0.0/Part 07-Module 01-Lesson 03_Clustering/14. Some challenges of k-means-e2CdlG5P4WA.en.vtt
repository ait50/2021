Now this wraps up what we're going to talk about in

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.190
terms of the k-means algorithm.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.290
What I'll have you do is practice much more in the coding aspects of

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.290
this in the mini project.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.720
But before we do that,

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.820
here are few thoughts on things that k-means is very valuable for

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.160
and a few places where you need to be careful if you're going to try to use it.
