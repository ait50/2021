00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.490
So now we look at the limits of what k-means can or

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.689
cannot do, and you're going to try to break it.

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:08.530
And specifically, talk about local minima and to do this, I want to ask you

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.760
a question that you can think about and see if you get the answer right.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.360
Suppose you use a fixed number of cluster centers, two or three or four.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.680
Will the output for any fixed training set, always be the same?

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.743
So given a fixed data set, given a fixed number of cluster centers,

00:00:26.743 --> 00:00:29.610
when you run k-means will you always arrive at the same result?

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.610
Take your best guess.
