00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.410
Let me give another example and ask you a quiz.

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.540
Suppose we have data just like this over here.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.740
Do you think there could be a local minimum if you

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.750
initialize this data set with two cluster centers?

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.437
Is there a stable solution where which the two cluster would not end up

00:00:17.437 --> 00:00:19.660
one over here and one over here?

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.650
Or put differently, is there, does there exist a bad local minimum?

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.150
Yes or no?
