00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.680
The perhaps the most basic algorithm for clustering, and

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.520
by far the most used is called K-MEANS.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.030
And I'm going to work with you through the algorithm with many,

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.690
many quizzes for you.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.170
Here is our data space.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.350
And suppose we are given this type of data.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.430
The first question is intuitively, how many clusters do you see?

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.680
Truth telling, there is not a unique answer, it could be seven it could be one,

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.460
but give me the answer that seems to make the most sense
