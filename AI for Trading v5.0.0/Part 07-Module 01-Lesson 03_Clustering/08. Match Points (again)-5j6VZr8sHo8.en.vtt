00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:01.237
And this example is now easy.

00:00:01.237 --> 00:00:04.230
You can see that all the four over here fit with the green one.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.800
In fact, the separating line will be somewhere here and, in fact,

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.480
after the next iteration of optimize, with the assignment of those point, four

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.059
points of this cluster center and those three points of this cluster center.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.730
You can see that this cluster center will move

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.750
straight into the center of those four points.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.950
And this cluster center will move to the center of those three points.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.470
Have we truly achieved our result?

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.580
We now have assumed it's two clusters.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.030
But our algorithm of iteratively assigning and

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.570
optimizing has moved the cluster center straight into what we

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.890
would argue is actually the correct centroid for those two clusters over here.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.990
That is called the k-Means algorithm.
