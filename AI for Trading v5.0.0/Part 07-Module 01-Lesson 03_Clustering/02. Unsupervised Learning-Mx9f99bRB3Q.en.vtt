00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.140
So Katie, this is going to be a unit on unsupervised learning.

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.060
&gt;&gt; Unsupervised learning is something that's very important,

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.250
because most of the time, the data that you get in the real world doesn't have

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.210
little flags attached that tell you the correct answer.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.730
So what are you to do as a machine learner in that case?

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.120
You turn to unsupervised techniques to still figure something out

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.620
about that data.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.310
&gt;&gt; Okay, let's talk about them.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.930
Given a dataset without labels over all the data points are of the same class.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.530
There are sometimes still things you can do to extract useful information.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:37.200
Like this dataset over here, where I would say this dataset is structured in

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.190
a way that is useful to recognize for a machine learning algorithm.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.480
&gt;&gt; When we look at this by eye, it looks like there's clumps or

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.060
clusters in the data.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.560
And if we could identify those clumps or clusters, we could maybe say something

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.730
about a new, unknown data point and what its neighbors might be like.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.710
&gt;&gt; Or here's a second example of data.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.850
Maybe the data looks just like this.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.050
There's something we can say here as well.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:01.910
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.410
So all the data in this example looks like it lives on some kind of line or

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.960
some complicated shape that you seem to be drawing in there right now.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.582
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And it's, it's, it's used to be a two-dimensional space, with x and

00:01:12.582 --> 00:01:13.710
y over here.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.200
But some of it we can reduce it to a one-dimensional line.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.580
So that's called what?

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.830
&gt;&gt; That's called dimensionality reduction, usually.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.089
&gt;&gt; Dimensionality reduction.

00:01:21.089 --> 00:01:23.200
So we learned about, a little bit about clustering.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.830
&gt;&gt; Clustering is what we'll learn in this lesson.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.288
&gt;&gt; And you can see here an example of something also called unsupervised

00:01:29.288 --> 00:01:31.890
learning of dimensionality reduction.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.010
&gt;&gt; Which we will get in a future lesson.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.792
&gt;&gt; So these kind of things where you find structure in the data without labels,

00:01:37.792 --> 00:01:39.938
they're called unsupervised learning.

00:01:39.938 --> 00:01:42.350
And we're now gong to dive into the wonderful,

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.040
wonderful magical land of unsupervised learning.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.100
&gt;&gt; Sounds great, let's dive in.
