00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.350
So let's make another data set.

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.910
In this case, you're going to pick three cluster centers and,

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.770
then, conveniently, we'll draw three clusters onto my diagram.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.060
Obviously, for three cluster centers, you want a cluster to be here, right here,

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.230
and right over here.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.620
So my question is, is it possible that all these data

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.950
points over here are represented by one cluster, and

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.370
these guys over here by two separate clusters.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.750
Given what you know about k-means, do you think it can happen

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.702
that all these points here fall into one cluster and those two

00:00:33.702 --> 00:00:37.200
fall into two clusters as one what's called a local minimum for clustering.
