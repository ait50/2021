00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:01.483
And I hope you said three,

00:00:01.483 --> 00:00:03.976
it's pretty obvious that there should be three centroids here.

00:00:03.976 --> 00:00:07.788
So let's add three, one, two, three.

00:00:07.788 --> 00:00:10.240
So they're all starting out right next to each other, but

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.460
we'll see how as the algorithm progresses, they end up in the right place.
