00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.550
So after the assign step, you can now see these little blue lines over

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.550
here that marry data points to cluster centers.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.650
And now we're going to think of what this rubber bands.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.460
They're rubber bands that like to be as short as possible.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.290
In the optimize step, we're not allowed, now allowed to move the green cluster

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.320
center to a point where the total rubber band is minimized.
