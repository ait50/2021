Okay, and I would argue it's 2.

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.621
There's a cluster over here.

00:00:03.621 --> 00:00:05.590
And a cluster over here.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.498
And the cluster centers respectively lie right over here and

00:00:09.498 --> 00:00:10.670
somewhere over here.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.210
So that's the place we would like to find to characterize the data.
