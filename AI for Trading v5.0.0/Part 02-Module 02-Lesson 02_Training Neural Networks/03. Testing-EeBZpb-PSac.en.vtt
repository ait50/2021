00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.819
So let's look at the following data form by blue and red points,

00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:06.628
and the following two classification models

00:00:06.628 --> 00:00:10.105
which separates the blue points from the red points.

00:00:10.105 --> 00:00:13.905
The question is which of these two models is better?

00:00:13.904 --> 00:00:16.689
Well, it seems like the one on the left is simpler since it's

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.980
a line and the one on the right is more complicated since it's a complex curve.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.250
Now the one in the right makes no mistakes.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.149
It correctly separates all the points,

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:32.515
on the other hand, the one in the left does make some mistakes.

00:00:32.515 --> 00:00:36.429
So we're inclined to think that the one in the right is better.

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:39.420
In order to really find out which one is better,

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.774
we introduce the concept of training and testing sets.

00:00:42.774 --> 00:00:48.344
We'll denote them as follows: the solid color points are the training set,

00:00:48.344 --> 00:00:52.414
and the points with the white inside are the testing set.

00:00:52.414 --> 00:00:54.670
And what we'll do is we'll train our models in

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.298
the training set without looking at the testing set,

00:00:59.298 --> 00:01:03.810
and then we'll evaluate the results on that testing to see how we did.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.260
So according to this,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.209
we trained the linear model and

00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:12.534
the complex model on the training set to obtain these two boundaries.

00:01:12.534 --> 00:01:17.530
Now we reintroduce the testing set and we can see that the model in

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.379
the left made one mistake while the model in the right made two mistakes.

00:01:23.379 --> 00:01:26.594
So in the end, the simple model was better.

00:01:26.593 --> 00:01:29.193
Does that match our intuition?.

00:01:29.194 --> 00:01:32.980
Well, it does, because in machine learning that's what we're going to do.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.099
Whenever we can choose between a simple model that does

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:40.655
the job and a complicated model that may do the job a little bit better,

00:01:40.655 --> 00:01:43.000
we always try to go for the simpler model.
