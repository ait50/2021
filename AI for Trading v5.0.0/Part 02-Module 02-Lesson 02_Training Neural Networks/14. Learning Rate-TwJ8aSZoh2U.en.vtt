00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.819
The question of what learning rate to use is pretty much

00:00:02.819 --> 00:00:06.343
a research question itself but here's a general rule.

00:00:06.344 --> 00:00:12.028
If your learning rate is too big then you're taking huge steps which could be fast at

00:00:12.028 --> 00:00:14.730
the beginning but you may miss the minimum and keep

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.120
going which will make your model pretty chaotic.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.640
If you have a small learning rate you will make

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.079
steady steps and have a better chance of arriving to your local minimum.

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:28.769
This may make your model very slow, but in general,

00:00:28.768 --> 00:00:32.298
a good rule of thumb is if your model's not working,

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:34.935
decrease the learning rate.

00:00:34.935 --> 00:00:37.100
The best learning rates are those which

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.710
decrease as the model is getting closer to a solution.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.298
We'll see that Keras has some options to let us do this.
