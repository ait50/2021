00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.430
Here's another problem that can occur.

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.128
Let's take a look at the sigmoid function.

00:00:05.128 --> 00:00:08.169
The curve gets pretty flat on the sides.

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:13.400
So, if we calculate the derivative at a point way at the right or way at the left,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.129
this derivative is almost zero.

00:00:17.129 --> 00:00:21.730
This is not good cause a derivative is what tells us in what direction to move.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.405
This gets even worse in most linear perceptrons. Check this out.

00:00:26.405 --> 00:00:31.039
We call that the derivative of the error function with respect to a weight was

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.018
the product of all the derivatives calculated

00:00:34.018 --> 00:00:37.733
at the nodes in the corresponding path to the output.

00:00:37.734 --> 00:00:41.588
All these derivatives are derivatives as a sigmoid function,

00:00:41.588 --> 00:00:47.733
so they're small and the product of a bunch of small numbers is tiny.

00:00:47.734 --> 00:00:52.189
This makes the training difficult because basically grading the [inaudible] gives us very,

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:55.340
very tiny changes to make on the weights,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.250
which means, we make very tiny steps and we'll never be able to descend Mount Everest.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.000
So how do we fix it? Well, there are some ways.
