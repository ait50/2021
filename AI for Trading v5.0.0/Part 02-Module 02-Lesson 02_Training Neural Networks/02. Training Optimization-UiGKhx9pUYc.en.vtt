00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
So by now we've learned how to build

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.375
a deep neural network and how to train it to fit our data.

00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:08.460
Sometimes however, we go out there and train on

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.550
ourselves and find out that nothing works as planned.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.814
Why? Because there are many things that can fail.

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:16.786
Our architecture can be poorly chosen,

00:00:16.786 --> 00:00:18.089
our data can be noisy,

00:00:18.088 --> 00:00:21.823
our model could maybe be taking years to run and we need it to run faster.

00:00:21.824 --> 00:00:24.120
We need to learn ways to optimize

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.059
the training of our models and this is what we'll do next.
