00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
So, here's another way to solve a local minimum problem.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.230
The idea is to walk a bit fast with momentum and

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.618
determination in a way that if you get stuck in a local minimum,

00:00:10.618 --> 00:00:16.559
you can, sort of, power through and get over the hump to look for a lower minimum.

00:00:16.559 --> 00:00:20.310
So let's look at what normal gradient descent does.

00:00:20.309 --> 00:00:23.729
It gets us all the way here. No problem.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.065
Now, we want to go over the hump but by now the gradient is zero or too small,

00:00:29.065 --> 00:00:31.454
so it won't give us a good step.

00:00:31.454 --> 00:00:33.270
What if we look at the previous ones?

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.109
What about say the average of the last few steps.

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:39.270
If we take the average, this will takes us in

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.435
direction and push us a bit towards the hump.

00:00:43.435 --> 00:00:46.530
Now the average seems a bit drastic since the step we made 10

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.484
steps ago is much less relevant than the step we last made.

00:00:50.484 --> 00:00:52.170
So, we can say, for example,

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.394
the average of the last three or four steps.

00:00:54.393 --> 00:00:57.509
Even better, we can weight each step so that

00:00:57.509 --> 00:01:02.420
the previous step matters a lot and the steps before that matter less and less.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.849
Here is where we introduce momentum.

00:01:05.849 --> 00:01:10.260
Momentum is a constant beta between 0 and 1 that

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.230
attaches to the steps as follows: the previous step gets multiplied by 1,

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.140
the one before, by beta, the one before,

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.849
by beta squared, the one before,

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:25.950
by beta cubed, etc.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.530
In this way, the steps that happened a long time

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.079
ago will matter less than the ones that happened recently.

00:01:32.078 --> 00:01:34.393
We can see that that gets us over the hump.

00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:37.454
But now, once we get to the global minimum,

00:01:37.453 --> 00:01:41.723
it'll still be pushing us away a bit but not as much.

00:01:41.724 --> 00:01:43.847
This may seem vague, but the algorithms that

00:01:43.846 --> 00:01:46.669
use momentum seem to work really well in practice.
