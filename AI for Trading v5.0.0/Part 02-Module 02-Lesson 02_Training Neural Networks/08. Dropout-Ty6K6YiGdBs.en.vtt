00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.705
Here's another way to prevent overfitting.

00:00:02.705 --> 00:00:04.448
So, let's say this is you,

00:00:04.448 --> 00:00:07.589
and one day you decide to practice sports.

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.823
So, on Monday you play tennis,

00:00:09.823 --> 00:00:11.759
on Tuesday you lift weights,

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.070
on Wednesday you play American football,

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.245
on Thursday you play baseball,

00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:18.344
on Friday you play basketball,

00:00:18.344 --> 00:00:20.644
and on Saturday you play ping pong.

00:00:20.643 --> 00:00:22.648
Now, after a week you've kind of

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:25.739
noticed that you've done most of them with your dominant hand.

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:31.254
So, you're developing a large muscle on that arm but not on the other arm.

00:00:31.254 --> 00:00:33.265
This is disappointing.

00:00:33.265 --> 00:00:34.793
So, what can you do?

00:00:34.793 --> 00:00:36.839
Well, let's spice it up on the next week.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.630
What we'll do is on Monday we'll tie

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.054
our right hand behind our back and try to play tennis with the left hand.

00:00:44.054 --> 00:00:46.770
On Tuesday, we'll tie our left hand

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.500
behind your back and try to lift weights with the right hand.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.243
Then on Wednesday again,

00:00:52.243 --> 00:00:56.250
we'll tie our right hand and play American football with the left one.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.850
On Thursday we'll take it easy and play baseball with both hands, that's fine.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.500
Then, on Friday we'll tie both hands behind our back and try to play basketball.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.875
That won't work out too well.

00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:09.409
But it's OK. It's the training process.

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:10.995
And then on Saturday again,

00:01:10.995 --> 00:01:15.635
we tie our left hand behind our back and play ping pong with the right.

00:01:15.635 --> 00:01:21.314
After a week, we see that we've developed both of our biceps. Pretty good job.

00:01:21.313 --> 00:01:25.029
This is something that happens a lot when we train neural networks.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.858
Sometimes one part of the network has

00:01:26.858 --> 00:01:30.578
very large weights and it ends up dominating all the training,

00:01:30.578 --> 00:01:33.369
while another part of the network doesn't

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.504
really play much of a role so it doesn't get trained.

00:01:36.504 --> 00:01:39.359
So, what we'll do to solve this is sometimes during training,

00:01:39.358 --> 00:01:43.084
we'll turn this part off and let the rest of the network train.

00:01:43.084 --> 00:01:46.343
More thoroughly, what we do is as we go through the epochs,

00:01:46.343 --> 00:01:49.673
we randomly turn off some of the nodes and say,

00:01:49.674 --> 00:01:52.129
you shall not pass through here.

00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:54.609
In that case, the other nodes have to pick up

00:01:54.608 --> 00:01:57.905
the slack and take more part in the training.

00:01:57.905 --> 00:02:03.549
So, for example, in the first epoch we're not allowed to use this node.

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.664
So, we do our feat forward and our back propagation passes without using it.

00:02:08.663 --> 00:02:10.655
In the second epoch,

00:02:10.655 --> 00:02:13.503
we can't use these two nodes.

00:02:13.503 --> 00:02:16.204
Again, we do our feet forward and back prop.

00:02:16.205 --> 00:02:20.965
And in the third epoch we can't use these nodes over here.

00:02:20.965 --> 00:02:25.289
So, again, we do forward and back prop.

00:02:25.288 --> 00:02:27.309
And finally in last epoch,

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.818
we can't use these two nodes over here.

00:02:29.818 --> 00:02:31.598
So, we continue like that.

00:02:31.598 --> 00:02:36.158
What we'll do to drop the nodes is we'll give the algorithm a parameter.

00:02:36.158 --> 00:02:42.218
This parameter is the probability that each node gets dropped at a particular epoch.

00:02:42.218 --> 00:02:46.358
For example, if we give it a 0.2 it means each epoch,

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:51.264
each node gets turned off with a probability of 20 percent.

00:02:51.264 --> 00:02:53.770
Notice that some nodes may get turned off more than

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.810
others and some others may never get turned off.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.068
And this is OK since we're doing it over and over and over.

00:03:00.068 --> 00:03:03.209
On average each node will get the same treatment.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.560
This method is called dropout and it's really

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.259
really common and useful to train neural networks.
