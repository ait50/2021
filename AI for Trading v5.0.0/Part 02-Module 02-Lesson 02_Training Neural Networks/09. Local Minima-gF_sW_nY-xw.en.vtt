00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.897
So let's recall a gradient descent does.

00:00:01.897 --> 00:00:05.097
What it does is it looks at the direction where you descend the

00:00:05.097 --> 00:00:09.213
most and then it takes a step in that direction.

00:00:09.214 --> 00:00:11.698
But in Mt. Everest, everything was nice and pretty

00:00:11.698 --> 00:00:14.379
since that was going to help us go down the mountain.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.960
But now, what if we try to do it here in this complicated mountain range.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.030
The Himalayans lowest point that we want to go is around here,

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.160
but if we do gradient descent,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.960
we get all the way here.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.730
And once we're here,

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.158
we look around ourselves and there's no direction where

00:00:32.158 --> 00:00:35.240
we can descend more since we're at a local minimum.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.539
We're stuck. In here,

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:40.243
gradient descent itself doesn't help us.

00:00:40.243 --> 00:00:42.000
We need something else.
