00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.475
Now let me show you a subtle way of overfitting a model.

00:00:03.475 --> 00:00:07.120
Let's look at the simplest data set in the world, two points,

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.359
the point one one which is blue and the point minus one minus one which is red.

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:15.189
Now we want to separate them with a line.

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:18.010
I'll give you two equations and you tell me which one

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.679
gives a smaller error and that's going to be the quiz.

00:00:21.678 --> 00:00:26.009
Equation one is x1 plus x2.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.454
That means w1 equals w2 is one and the bias b is zero.

00:00:31.454 --> 00:00:35.673
And then equation two is 10x1 plus 10x2.

00:00:35.673 --> 00:00:41.314
So that means w1 equals w2 equals 10 and the bias b equals zero.

00:00:41.314 --> 00:00:43.179
Now the question is,

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:46.925
which prediction gives a smaller error?

00:00:46.924 --> 00:00:49.239
This is not an easy question but I want you to think about

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.000
it and maybe make some calculations, if necessary.
