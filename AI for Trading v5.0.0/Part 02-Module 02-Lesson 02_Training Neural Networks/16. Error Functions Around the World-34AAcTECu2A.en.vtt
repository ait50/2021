00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.399
So, in this nano degree,

00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:02.844
we covered a few error functions,

00:00:02.845 --> 00:00:07.150
but there are a bunch of other error functions around the world that made the shortlist,

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.505
but we didn't have time to study them.

00:00:09.505 --> 00:00:13.050
So, here they are. These are the ones you met: there

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.021
is Mount Everest and Mount Kilimanjerror.

00:00:17.021 --> 00:00:19.708
The ones you didn't meet: there is Mt.

00:00:19.708 --> 00:00:22.864
Reinerror, he's a big Seahawks fan.

00:00:22.864 --> 00:00:26.695
Straight from Italy, we got Mount Ves-oops-vius,

00:00:26.695 --> 00:00:30.285
and my favorite, from Iceland,

00:00:30.285 --> 00:00:33.478
we got the Eyjafvillajokull.

00:00:33.478 --> 00:00:39.420
This is the famous volcano that stopped all the European flights back in 2012.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.090
See what I did there is I took the original name which is

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:49.859
Eyjafjallajokull and then I changed the word Jalla to Villa,

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:52.270
which is Icelandic for error.
