00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.095
One way to solve this is to use random restarts,

00:00:03.095 --> 00:00:05.009
and this is just very simple.

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.574
We start from a few different random places and do gradient descend from all of them.

00:00:10.573 --> 00:00:13.964
This increases the probability that we'll get to the global minimum,

00:00:13.964 --> 00:00:17.000
or at least a pretty good local minimum.
