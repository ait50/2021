In the last section we pointed out the difference between a discrete and

00:00:03.758 --> 00:00:06.839
a continuous error function and discovered that in order for

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.814
us to use gradient descent we need a continuous error function.

00:00:10.814 --> 00:00:13.634
In order to do this we also need to move

00:00:13.634 --> 00:00:17.039
from discrete predictions to continuous predictions.

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.190
Let me show you what I mean by that.
