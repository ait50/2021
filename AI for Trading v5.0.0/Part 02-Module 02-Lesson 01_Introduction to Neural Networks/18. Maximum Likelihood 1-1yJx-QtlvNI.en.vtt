00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.859
So we're still in our quest for an algorithm that will help

00:00:02.859 --> 00:00:05.525
us pick the best model that separates our data.

00:00:05.525 --> 00:00:09.984
Well, since we're dealing with probabilities then let's use them in our favor.

00:00:09.984 --> 00:00:12.894
Let's say I'm a student and I have two models.

00:00:12.894 --> 00:00:16.300
One that tells me that my probability of getting accepted is

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.859
80% and one that tells me the probability is 55%.

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:22.855
Which model looks more accurate?

00:00:22.855 --> 00:00:24.879
Well, if I got accepted then I'd say

00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:28.210
the better model is probably the one that says 80%.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.679
What if I didn't get accepted?

00:00:29.678 --> 00:00:33.983
Then the more accurate model is more likely the one that says 55 percent.

00:00:33.984 --> 00:00:37.469
But I'm just one person. What if it was me and a friend?

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.789
Well, the best model would more likely be the one that

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:44.506
gives the higher probabilities to the events that happened to us,

00:00:44.506 --> 00:00:47.085
whether it's acceptance or rejection.

00:00:47.085 --> 00:00:49.149
This sounds pretty intuitive.

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.310
The method is called maximum likelihood.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:58.353
What we do is we pick the model that gives the existing labels the highest probability.

00:00:58.353 --> 00:01:00.259
Thus, by maximizing the probability,

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:02.000
we can pick the best possible model.
