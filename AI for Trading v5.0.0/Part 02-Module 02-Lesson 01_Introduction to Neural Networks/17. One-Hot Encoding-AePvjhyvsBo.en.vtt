00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.754
So, as we've seen so far,

00:00:01.754 --> 00:00:03.674
all our algorithms are numerical.

00:00:03.674 --> 00:00:05.807
This means we need to input numbers,

00:00:05.807 --> 00:00:08.640
such as a score in a test or the grades,

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.600
but the input data will not always look like numbers.

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.184
Sometimes it looks like this.

00:00:14.185 --> 00:00:15.925
Let's say the module receives as an input

00:00:15.925 --> 00:00:18.640
the fact that you got a gift or didn't get a gift.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.719
How do we turn that into numbers? Well, that's easy.

00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:24.994
If you've got a gift, we'll just say that the input variable is 1.

00:00:24.995 --> 00:00:26.144
And, if you didn't get a gift,

00:00:26.144 --> 00:00:29.085
we'll just say that the input variable is 0.

00:00:29.085 --> 00:00:31.350
But, what if we have more classes as before or,

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.515
let's say, our classes are Duck, Beaver and Walrus?

00:00:34.515 --> 00:00:37.649
What variable do we input in the algorithm?

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.530
Maybe, we can input a 0 or 1 and a 2,

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.120
but that would not work because it would assume dependencies between

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:45.287
the classes that we can't have. So, this is what we do.

00:00:45.287 --> 00:00:48.954
What we do is, we come up with one variable for each of the classes.

00:00:48.954 --> 00:00:50.739
So, our table becomes like this.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.274
That's one variable for Duck,

00:00:52.274 --> 00:00:55.164
one for Beaver and one for Walrus.

00:00:55.164 --> 00:00:58.109
And, each one has its corresponding column.

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.509
Now, if the input is a duck then the variable for duck is

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:06.780
1 and the variables for beaver and walrus are 0.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.775
Similarly for the beaver and the walrus.

00:01:09.775 --> 00:01:14.770
We may have more columns of data but at least there are no unnecessary dependencies.

00:01:14.769 --> 00:01:16.834
This process is called The One-Hot Encoding

00:01:16.834 --> 00:01:19.099
and it will be used a lot for processing data.
