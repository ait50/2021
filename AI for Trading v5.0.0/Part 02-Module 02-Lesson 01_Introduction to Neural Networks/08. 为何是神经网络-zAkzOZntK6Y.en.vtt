00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040
So you may be wondering why are these objects called neural networks.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.059
Well, the reason why they're called neural networks is

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:08.759
because perceptions kind of look like neurons in the brain.

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:11.525
In the left we have a perception with four inputs.

00:00:11.525 --> 00:00:12.809
The number is one, zero,

00:00:12.808 --> 00:00:14.689
four, and minus two.

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:15.990
And what the perception does,

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.504
it calculates some equations on the input and decides to return a one or a zero.

00:00:20.504 --> 00:00:24.839
In a similar way neurons in the brain take inputs coming from the dendrites.

00:00:24.838 --> 00:00:27.058
These inputs are nervous impulses.

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:30.464
So what the neuron does is it does something with the nervous impulses

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:35.054
and then it decides if it outputs a nervous impulse or not through the axon.

00:00:35.054 --> 00:00:38.070
The way we'll create neural networks later in this lesson

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.649
is by concatenating these perceptions so we'll be mimicking

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.200
the way the brain connects neurons by taking the output from

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.130
one and turning it into the input for another one.
