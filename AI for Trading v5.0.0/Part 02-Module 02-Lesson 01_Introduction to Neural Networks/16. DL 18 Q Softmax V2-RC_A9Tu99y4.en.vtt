00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.830
Let's switch to a different example for a moment.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.365
Let's say we have a model that will predict if you receive a gift or not.

00:00:06.365 --> 00:00:09.220
So, the model use predictions in the following way.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.565
It says, the probability that you get a gift is 0.8,

00:00:13.564 --> 00:00:18.759
which automatically implies that the probability that you don't receive a gift is 0.2.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.265
And what does the model do?

00:00:20.265 --> 00:00:22.449
What the model does is take some inputs.

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.064
For example, is it your birthday or have it been good all year?

00:00:26.065 --> 00:00:27.580
And based on those inputs,

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:31.104
it calculates a linear model which would be the score.

00:00:31.105 --> 00:00:34.090
Then, the probability that you get the gift or not

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.350
is simply the sigmoid function applied to that score.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.539
Now, what if you had more options than just getting a gift or not a gift?

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:44.804
Let's say we have a model that just tell us what animal we just saw,

00:00:44.804 --> 00:00:47.090
and the options are a duck,

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.890
a beaver and a walrus.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.015
We want a model that tells an answer along the lines of,

00:00:53.015 --> 00:00:55.789
the probability of a duck is 0.67,

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.579
the probability of a beaver is 0.24,

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.689
and the probability of a walrus is 0.09.

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:06.319
Notice that the probabilities need to add to one.

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:09.377
Let's say we have a linear model based on some inputs.

00:01:09.378 --> 00:01:12.375
The inputs could be, does it have a beak or not?

00:01:12.375 --> 00:01:14.799
Number of teeth. Number of feathers.

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.599
Hair, no hair. Does it live in the water? Does it fly?

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:21.750
Etc. We calculate linear function based on those inputs,

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.209
and let's say we get some scores.

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:26.519
So, the duck gets a score of two,

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:28.554
and the beaver gets a score of one,

00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:30.975
and the walrus gets a score of zero.

00:01:30.974 --> 00:01:32.339
And now the question is,

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.939
how do we turn these scores into probabilities?

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.689
The first thing we need to satisfy with probabilities is as we said,

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.539
they need to add to one.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.840
So the two, the one,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.500
and the zero do not add to one.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.719
The second thing we need to satisfy is,

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:50.459
since the duck had a higher score than the beaver

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:53.204
and the beaver had a higher score than the walrus,

00:01:53.204 --> 00:01:57.554
then we want the probability of the duck to be higher than the probability of the beaver,

00:01:57.555 --> 00:02:02.150
and the probability of the beaver to be higher than the probability of the walrus.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.060
Here's a simple way of doing it.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.134
Let's take each score and divide it by the sum of all the scores.

00:02:08.134 --> 00:02:11.846
The two becomes two divided by two plus one plus zero,

00:02:11.847 --> 00:02:15.950
the one becomes one divided by two plus one plus zero,

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:20.644
and the zero becomes zero divided by two plus one plus zero.

00:02:20.645 --> 00:02:25.219
This kind of works because the probabilities we obtain are two thirds for the duck,

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:26.884
one third for the beaver,

00:02:26.884 --> 00:02:29.419
and zero for the walrus.

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:31.849
That works but there's a little problem. Let's think about it.

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.745
What could this problem be?

00:02:33.745 --> 00:02:35.610
The problem is the following.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.295
What happens if our scores are negative?

00:02:38.294 --> 00:02:39.929
This is completely plausible since the scores are

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.250
linear function which could give negative values.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.069
What if we had, say, scores of 1, 0 and (-1)?

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.829
Then, one of the probabilities would turn into one divided by

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.864
one plus zero plus minus one which is zero,

00:02:52.864 --> 00:02:55.930
and we know very well that we cannot divide by zero.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.929
This unfortunately won't work,

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:00.719
but the idea is good.

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:06.694
How can we turn this idea into one that works all the time even for negative numbers?

00:03:06.694 --> 00:03:10.539
Well, it's almost like we need to turn these scores into positive scores.

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:11.849
How do we do this?

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.299
Is there a function that can help us?

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.910
This is the quiz. Let's look at some options.

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:21.090
There's sine, cosine, logarithm, and exponential.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.219
Quiz. Which one of these functions will turn every number into a positive number?

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:28.000
