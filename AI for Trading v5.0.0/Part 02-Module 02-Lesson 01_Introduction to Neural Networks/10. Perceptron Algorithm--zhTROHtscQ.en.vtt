00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
So we had a question we're trying to answer and the question is,

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.218
how do we find this line that separates

00:00:05.219 --> 00:00:08.980
the blue points from the red points in the best possible way?

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.330
Let's answer this question by first looking at

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.663
a small example with three blue points and three red points.

00:00:14.663 --> 00:00:17.000
And we're going to describe an algorithm that will find

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.972
the line that splits these points properly.

00:00:19.972 --> 00:00:21.980
So the computer doesn't know where to start.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.250
It might as well start at a random place by picking a random linear equation.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.960
This equation will define a line and

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.609
a positive and negative area given in blue and red respectively.

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.130
What we're going to do is to look at how badly this line

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.399
is doing and then move it around to try to get better and better.

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:40.450
Now the question is,

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.310
how do we find how badly this line is doing?

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.624
So let's ask all the points.

00:00:45.624 --> 00:00:49.344
Here we have four points that are correctly classified.

00:00:49.344 --> 00:00:56.000
They are these two blue points in the blue area and these two red points in the red area.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.390
And these points are correctly classified,

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.200
so they say, "I'm good."

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.409
And then we have these two points that are incorrectly classified.

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.079
That's this red point in the blue area and this blue point in the red area.

00:01:09.078 --> 00:01:12.048
We want to get as much information from them so we want them

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.754
to tell us something so that we can improve this line.

00:01:15.754 --> 00:01:18.625
So what is it that they can tell us?

00:01:18.625 --> 00:01:20.500
So here we have a misclassified point,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.560
this red point in the blue area.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.808
Now think about this.

00:01:23.808 --> 00:01:25.239
If you were this point,

00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:27.609
what would you tell the line to do?

00:01:27.608 --> 00:01:31.084
Would you like it to come closer to you or farther from you?

00:01:31.084 --> 00:01:32.964
That's our quiz.

00:01:32.965 --> 00:01:37.000
Will the misclassified point want the line to come closer to it or farther from it?
