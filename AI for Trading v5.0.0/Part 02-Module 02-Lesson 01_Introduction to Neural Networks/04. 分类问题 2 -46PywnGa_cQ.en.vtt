00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
Correct. Well, it seems that this data can be

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.564
nicely separated by a line which is this line over here,

00:00:05.565 --> 00:00:08.580
and it seems that most students over the line get

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.210
accepted and most students under the line get rejected.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.825
So this line is going to be our model.

00:00:15.824 --> 00:00:18.300
The model makes a couple of mistakes since there are

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.019
a few blue points that are under the line and a few red points over the line.

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:24.169
But we're not going to care about those.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.245
I will say that it's safe to predict that if a point is over the line

00:00:28.245 --> 00:00:33.600
the student gets accepted and if it's under the line then the student gets rejected.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.210
So based on this model we'll look at the new student that we see

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.495
that they are over here at the point 7:6 which is above the line.

00:00:39.494 --> 00:00:43.224
So we can assume with some confidence that the student gets accepted.

00:00:43.225 --> 00:00:47.070
So if you answered yes, that's the correct answer.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.695
And now a question arises.

00:00:48.695 --> 00:00:51.475
The question is, how do we find this line?

00:00:51.475 --> 00:00:53.469
So we can kind of eyeball it.

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:55.199
But the computer can't.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.745
We'll dedicate the rest of the session to show you algorithms that will find this line,

00:00:59.744 --> 00:01:01.184
not only for this example,

00:01:01.185 --> 00:01:04.000
but for much more general and complicated cases.
