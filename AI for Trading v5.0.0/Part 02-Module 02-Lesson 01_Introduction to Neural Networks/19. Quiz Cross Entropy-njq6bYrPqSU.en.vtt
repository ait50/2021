00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.137
So a quick recap. We have two models,

00:00:02.137 --> 00:00:05.009
the bad one on the left and the good one on the right.

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.559
And the way to tell they're bad or good is to calculate

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:11.730
the probability of each point being the color it is according to the model.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.759
Multiply these probabilities in order to obtain the probability of

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.309
the whole arrangement and then check that the model on

00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:20.960
the right gives us a much higher probability than the model on the left.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.315
Now all we need to do is to maximize this probability.

00:00:25.315 --> 00:00:29.690
But probability is a product of numbers and products are hard.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.820
Maybe this product of four numbers doesn't look so scary.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.642
But what if we have thousands of datapoints?

00:00:35.642 --> 00:00:38.914
That would correspond to a product of thousands of numbers,

00:00:38.914 --> 00:00:41.594
all of them between zero and one.

00:00:41.594 --> 00:00:43.655
This product would be very tiny,

00:00:43.655 --> 00:00:50.545
something like 0.0000 something and we definitely want to stay away from those numbers.

00:00:50.545 --> 00:00:55.298
Also, if I have a product of thousands of numbers and I change one of them,

00:00:55.298 --> 00:00:57.630
the product will change drastically.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.642
In summary, we really want to stay away from products.

00:01:02.642 --> 00:01:04.500
And what's better than products?

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.265
Well, let's ask our friend here.

00:01:07.265 --> 00:01:11.805
Products are bad, but sums are good. Let's do sums.

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:14.885
So let's try to turn these products into sums.

00:01:14.885 --> 00:01:19.939
We need to find a function that will help us turn products into sums.

00:01:19.938 --> 00:01:21.779
What would this function be?

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.534
It sounds like it's time for a quiz.

00:01:23.534 --> 00:01:26.745
Quiz. Which function will help us out here?

00:01:26.745 --> 00:01:31.765
Sine, cosine, logarithm or the exponential function?

00:01:31.765 --> 00:01:33.450
Enter your answer below.
