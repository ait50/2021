00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
We briefly mentioned multi-class classification

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.439
in the last video but let me be more specific.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.469
It seems that neural networks work really well when

00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:10.278
the problem consist on classifying two classes.

00:00:10.278 --> 00:00:13.800
For example, if the model predicts a probability of receiving

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.625
a gift or not then the answer just comes as the output of the neural network.

00:00:18.625 --> 00:00:20.588
But what happens if we have more classes?

00:00:20.588 --> 00:00:23.643
Say, we want the model to tell us if an image is a duck,

00:00:23.643 --> 00:00:26.849
a beaver, or a walrus.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.695
Well, one thing we can do is create a neural network to predict if the image is a duck,

00:00:30.695 --> 00:00:33.990
then another neural network to predict if the image is a beaver,

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.408
and a third neural network to predict if the image is a walrus.

00:00:37.408 --> 00:00:42.548
Then we can just use SoftMax or pick the answer that gives us the highest probability.

00:00:42.548 --> 00:00:45.073
But this seems like overkill, right?

00:00:45.073 --> 00:00:48.280
The first layers of the neural network should be enough to tell us things about

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.545
the image and maybe just the last layer should tell us which animal it is.

00:00:52.545 --> 00:00:56.448
As a matter of fact, as you'll see in the CNN section,

00:00:56.448 --> 00:00:58.594
this is exactly the case.

00:00:58.594 --> 00:01:02.719
So what we need here is to add more nodes in the output layer and each one of

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.730
the nodes will give us the probability that the image is each of the animals.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.569
Now, we take the scores and apply the SoftMax function that was previously

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:15.989
defined to obtain well-defined probabilities.

00:01:15.989 --> 00:01:20.000
This is how we get neural networks to do multi-class classification.
