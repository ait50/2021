00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.575
The prediction is basically the answer we get from the algorithm.

00:00:03.575 --> 00:00:06.220
A discreet answer will be of the form yes, no.

00:00:06.219 --> 00:00:08.256
Whereas a continued answer will be a number,

00:00:08.256 --> 00:00:11.615
normally between zero and one which we'll consider a probability.

00:00:11.615 --> 00:00:13.224
In the running example,

00:00:13.224 --> 00:00:16.664
here we have our students where blue is accepted and red is rejected.

00:00:16.664 --> 00:00:21.035
And the discrete algorithm will tell us if a student is accepted or rejected

00:00:21.035 --> 00:00:25.679
by typing a zero for rejected students and a one for accepted students.

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:27.274
On the other hand,

00:00:27.274 --> 00:00:29.834
the farther our point is from the black line,

00:00:29.835 --> 00:00:32.505
the more drastic these probabilities are.

00:00:32.505 --> 00:00:36.240
Points that are well into the blue area get very high probabilities,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.050
such as this point with an 85% probability of being blue.

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:43.884
And points that are well into the red region are given very low probabilities,

00:00:43.884 --> 00:00:48.159
such as this point on the bottom that is given a 20% probability of being blue.

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:53.429
The points over the line are all given a 50% probability of being blue.

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:57.335
As you can see the probability is a function of the distance from the line.

00:00:57.335 --> 00:01:00.390
The way we move from discrete predictions to continuous,

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.075
is to simply change your activation function from the step function in the left,

00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:07.655
to the sigmoid function on the right.

00:01:07.655 --> 00:01:10.609
The sigmoid function is simply a function which for

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:14.629
large positive numbers will give us values very close to one.

00:01:14.629 --> 00:01:19.219
For large negative numbers will give us values very close to zero.

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:22.030
And for numbers that are close to zero,

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.599
it'll give you values that are close to point five.

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:32.684
The formula is sigmoid effects equals σ(x) = 1/(1 + exp(-x))

00:01:32.685 --> 00:01:38.245
So, before our model consisted of a line with a positive region and a negative region.

00:01:38.245 --> 00:01:42.010
Now it consists of an entire probability space or for each point in the plane

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.045
we are given the probability that the label of the point is one for the blue points,

00:01:46.045 --> 00:01:47.969
and zero for the red points.

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:51.370
For example, for this point the probability of

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.850
being blue is 50% and of being red is 50%.

00:01:55.849 --> 00:02:00.509
For this point, the probabilities are 40% for being blue,

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.975
and 60% for being red.

00:02:02.974 --> 00:02:06.446
For this one over here it's 30% for blue,

00:02:06.447 --> 00:02:08.469
and 70% for red.

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:11.439
And for this point all over here is 80% for being

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:14.655
blue and 25 percent for being red.

00:02:14.655 --> 00:02:17.360
The way we obtain this probability space is very simple.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.800
We just combine the linear function WX + b with the sigmoid function.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.830
So in the left we have the lines that represent the points for which WX + b is 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.630
zero, one, two, minus one, minus two, etc.

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.930
And once we apply the sigmoid function to each of these values in the plane,

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.515
we then obtain numbers from zero to one for each point.

00:02:40.514 --> 00:02:44.074
These numbers are just the probabilities of the point being blue.

00:02:44.074 --> 00:02:46.439
The probability of the point being blue is a prediction of

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:50.454
the model Y hat to sigmoid of W x plus b.

00:02:50.455 --> 00:02:53.415
Here we can see the lines for which the prediction is point five,

00:02:53.414 --> 00:02:55.259
point six, point seven,

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:58.419
point four, point three, et cetera.

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:01.539
As you can see, as we get more into the blue area,

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:04.905
σ(Wx + b) gets closer and closer to one.

00:03:04.905 --> 00:03:07.740
And as we move into the red area,

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.115
σ(Wx + b) gets closer and closer to zero.

00:03:11.115 --> 00:03:13.240
When we're over the main line,

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.120
W x plus b is zero,

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.319
which means sigmoid of W s plus b is exactly zero point five.

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.384
So here on the left we have our old perceptron with

00:03:21.384 --> 00:03:24.250
the activation function as a step function.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.669
And on the right we have our new perceptron,

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:29.944
where the activation function is the sigmoid function.

00:03:29.944 --> 00:03:31.984
What our new perceptron does,

00:03:31.985 --> 00:03:33.195
it takes the inputs,

00:03:33.194 --> 00:03:38.301
multiplies them by the weights in the edges and adds the results,

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:40.935
then applies the sigmoid function.

00:03:40.935 --> 00:03:45.170
So instead of returning one and zero like before it returns

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:49.984
values between zero and one such as 0.99 or 0.67 etc.

00:03:49.985 --> 00:03:53.285
Before it used to say the student got accepted or not,

00:03:53.284 --> 00:03:58.000
and now it says the probability of the student got accepted is this much.
