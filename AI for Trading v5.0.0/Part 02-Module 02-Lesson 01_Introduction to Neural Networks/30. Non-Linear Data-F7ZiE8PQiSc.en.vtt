00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.003
Now we've been dealing a lot with data sets that can be separated by a line,

00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:05.543
like this one over here.

00:00:05.543 --> 00:00:08.865
But as you can imagine the real world is much more complex than that.

00:00:08.865 --> 00:00:12.150
This is where neural networks can show their full potential.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.970
In the next few videos we'll see how to deal with

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.350
more complicated data sets that require

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.109
highly non-linear boundaries such as this one over here.
