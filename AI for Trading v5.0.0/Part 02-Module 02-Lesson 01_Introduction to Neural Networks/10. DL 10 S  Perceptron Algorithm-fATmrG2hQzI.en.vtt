Well, consider this. If you're in the wrong area,

00:00:02.924 --> 00:00:05.115
you would like the line to go over you,

00:00:05.115 --> 00:00:06.509
in order to be in the right area.

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.929
Thus, the points just come closer!

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.000
So the line can move towards it and eventually classify it correctly.
