00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
Well we're getting somewhere now.

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.099
We've concluded that the probability is important.

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:08.969
And that the better model will give us a better probability.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.544
Now the question is,

00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:13.109
how we maximize the probability.

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:16.559
Also, if remember correctly we're talking about an error function and how

00:00:16.559 --> 00:00:20.829
minimizing this error function will take us to the best possible solution.

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:23.070
Could these two things be connected?

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.362
Could we obtain an error function from the probability?

00:00:26.362 --> 00:00:29.750
Could it be that maximizing the probability is equivalent

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.000
to minimizing the error function? Maybe.
