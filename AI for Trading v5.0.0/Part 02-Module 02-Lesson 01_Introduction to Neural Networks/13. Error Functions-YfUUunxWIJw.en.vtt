00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.708
So the way we'll solve our problems from now on is with the help of an error function.

00:00:04.708 --> 00:00:09.419
An error function is simply something that tells us how far we are from the solution.

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:14.175
For example, if I'm here and my goal is to get to this plant,

00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:18.114
an error function will just tell me the distance from the plant.

00:00:18.114 --> 00:00:20.655
My approach would then be to look around myself,

00:00:20.655 --> 00:00:25.730
check in which direction I can take a step to get closer to the plant,

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.875
take that step and then repeat.

00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:33.000
Here the error is simply the distance from the plant.
