00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.865
A backtest is said to be valid or

00:00:02.865 --> 00:00:07.004
admissible if it satisfies at least the following two conditions.

00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:10.844
The first condition is that the profit calculation is realistic,

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:15.510
which means that the simulated profit and loss could actually have been achieved by

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.550
trading the same instruments in the same way that the backtest code implies.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.850
The second condition is that the strategy construction does not

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.240
benefit from look-ahead bias or from hindsight.

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:31.079
In other words, at the historical dates in the backtest,

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:34.409
a hypothetical trader would have possessed all of the knowledge

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:39.344
necessary to have actually implemented the strategy on those days.

00:00:39.344 --> 00:00:45.094
There are many kinds of mistakes which would render a backtest invalid or inadmissible.

00:00:45.094 --> 00:00:46.939
We will give a few examples.

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:50.134
Using a model for trading costs which

00:00:50.134 --> 00:00:54.309
underestimates the true cost is a violation of condition one.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:00.094
Often, this means that whole categories of assets need to be excluded because they are so

00:01:00.094 --> 00:01:02.795
illiquid that they would be impossible to trade

00:01:02.795 --> 00:01:06.290
at any significant size without prohibitive costs.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.590
Similarly, ignoring categories of costs such as

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.415
financing or taxes also violates condition one.

00:01:13.415 --> 00:01:17.120
Moreover, the backtest should not assume that it would have been able to

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.090
trade in volumes that are large relative to the actual volume,

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.795
and it should not assume that it could have executed

00:01:23.795 --> 00:01:27.170
during the day at the close price of that day.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.575
Yet another example of a violation of one is assuming

00:01:30.575 --> 00:01:34.775
the backtest could borrow more shares than what actually available to borrow.

00:01:34.775 --> 00:01:40.760
The know hindsight condition two is even more subtle and it's even more prone to abuses,

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.520
which render many backtest inadmissible for

00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:46.954
reasons that range from very obvious to very subtle.

00:01:46.954 --> 00:01:48.734
On the very obvious side,

00:01:48.734 --> 00:01:54.484
the backtest must be coded in such a way that prevents the use of tomorrow's news today.

00:01:54.484 --> 00:02:00.319
Ideally, every data point that is being used will have a knowledge timestamp representing

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:06.500
the time in history that the relevant data point became available to be used for trading.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.870
Many kinds of data become available in

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.469
the evenings after the major stock exchanges have closed.

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:17.270
A backtest cannot assume that data which would have been published in the evening on

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.355
day T could be used for trading on day T. Similarly,

00:02:22.354 --> 00:02:23.840
the final price of the day,

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.920
the close price on day T cannot be used for trading on day T.

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:31.069
Failing to adhere to these principles will

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.569
result in a backtest that may look great but the greatness in that case would be

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:41.044
an illusion that is impossible to translate into the performance of real investments.

00:02:41.044 --> 00:02:44.000
The use of technologies which did not exist in

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.735
the past can also lead to overly rosy calculations.

00:02:47.735 --> 00:02:51.950
For example, assuming the use of an LSTM neural network in

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:58.159
the 1990s when no one had this technology must be regarded with some skepticism.

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:01.069
Today, this technology is readily available.

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:02.269
So at the very least,

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.710
there's likely to be more competition going forward than there could have been during

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.680
a historical period when it is very likely there was no one using the method.
