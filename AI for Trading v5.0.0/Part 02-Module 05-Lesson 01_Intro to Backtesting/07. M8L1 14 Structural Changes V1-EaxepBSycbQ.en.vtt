00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.139
Proper statistical methodology in general and proper use of

00:00:04.139 --> 00:00:08.445
a test set in particular give a clear path detect overfitting.

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:11.609
Essentially, when the model's performance on the test set is

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:14.614
noticeably lower than on the training and validation sets,

00:00:14.615 --> 00:00:17.760
then this is evidence that the model may have been over fit.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.600
Of course, it is also possible that there was a structural change.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.670
Meaning that the structure of the market was

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.535
different over the period used as the test set.

00:00:26.535 --> 00:00:28.980
This is a distinct kind of problem,

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.530
as even good researchers can be negatively impacted by structural change,

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.664
whereas good researchers are definitionally

00:00:36.664 --> 00:00:40.655
never guilty of overfitting by definition of good research.

00:00:40.655 --> 00:00:43.925
Structural changes may be possible to anticipate.

00:00:43.924 --> 00:00:49.009
An example would be regulatory changes which fundamentally alter market structure.

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:52.390
Such changes are often announced before they're implemented.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.450
Nevertheless, in both cases overfitting and structural change,

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.685
the practical implications are the same.

00:00:58.685 --> 00:01:02.920
One does not expect the model to continue to perform in the out-of-sample period,

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.850
which is the coming year or two,

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:07.699
and use of the model in unadulterated form could

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.150
lead to overtrading and or investment losses.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.375
The future is the ultimate out-of-sample test set.

00:01:14.375 --> 00:01:18.650
It is a dataset which we know for sure hasn't been seen before or used in

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.109
research or biased the strategy development

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:24.094
in some subtle way that is hard to even fathom.

00:01:24.094 --> 00:01:27.968
Before one can believe the Sharpe ratio of a back-test,

00:01:27.968 --> 00:01:30.349
one must first believe that the back-test in

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:35.119
some past year represents the state of knowledge that one had back then,

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.685
basing that period as if it were the future.

00:01:37.685 --> 00:01:39.680
This is harder than it sounds.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.660
We must want to see the world as it truly is and not as we wish it to be.
