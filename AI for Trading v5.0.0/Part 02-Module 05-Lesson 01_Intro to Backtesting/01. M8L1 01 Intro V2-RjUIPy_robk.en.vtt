00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.605
Welcome back. In the next several lessons,you're going to learn about back-testing,

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:08.550
which is how quantum simulate as rigorously as possible.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.160
What would have happened if a trading strategy was

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.160
deployed in production over a historical period,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.910
in order to try to understand how it might perform in the future?

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.265
As we mentioned earlier in the course,

00:00:20.265 --> 00:00:24.810
back-testing is the last thing you'll do when researching and testing a strategy.

00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:26.309
As you can probably guess,

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:29.910
there are lots of important subtle considerations you need to keep in mind,

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.625
in order to make this simulation useful.

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:36.609
Let's keep going to learn the principles of back-testing.
