00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.309
Overtrading is defined as trading in larger sizes than would be optimal.

00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:10.710
If the expected size of a mispricing or an arbitrage is 10 basis points,

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.990
then no model should trade in such a way as to have 15 basis points of market impact,

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.914
as this cannot be sustainably profitable.

00:00:18.914 --> 00:00:23.429
In extreme cases, overtrading can completely kill an entire strategy.

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:27.179
A telltale sign, is that if a strategy coincidentally stops

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:31.739
working as soon as it is turned on in real markets at noticeable size,

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.004
then it is most likely overtrading.

00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:37.130
Further evidence, would be if the backtest appears to

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.310
begin working again when the live model is turned off.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.780
Given that trading is costly and all trades have an impact on the market,

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.880
overfitting can lead to overtrading.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.865
If the modeler has overfit,

00:00:48.865 --> 00:00:51.440
then the models predicted Alpha will often be

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:54.724
larger than the true Alpha which exists in the world.

00:00:54.725 --> 00:00:59.800
In a world where trading is costly and market frictions of all kinds abound,

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:04.804
unless you can be extremely certain that an advanced statistical method is not overfit,

00:01:04.805 --> 00:01:09.980
you may indeed achieve better true out-of-sample performance by applying

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:15.670
the Occam's razor principle and employing a model which has relatively few parameters.
