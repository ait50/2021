00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.835
A backtest is a simulation of running

00:00:02.835 --> 00:00:06.390
a trading strategy through some historical period of time.

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:10.649
Ideally, the backtest should simulate as accurately as possible

00:00:10.648 --> 00:00:14.910
what would have actually happened in real-time production processes.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.649
If aspects of real-time production trading are left out of the simulation,

00:00:19.649 --> 00:00:22.034
then even after backtesting,

00:00:22.035 --> 00:00:25.065
there's no reference for how these aspects might

00:00:25.065 --> 00:00:29.655
affect strategy performance in the future and this is dangerous.

00:00:29.655 --> 00:00:33.240
You have already performed rudimentary backtests in

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.620
this course when you have tested your trading strategies on historical data,

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:40.349
but these tests which you performed as part of

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.469
the Alpha research process are not

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.519
sophisticated enough to inspire confidence in the trading strategy.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.440
One could call anything that simulates trades using historical data of backtest,

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:55.519
but this is like calling throwing a paper airplane into the air,

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.830
a test of rocket spaceflight.

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.259
NASA is very professional about making

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:02.905
rockets because they really don't want them to blow up.

00:01:02.905 --> 00:01:07.519
Likewise, quants who designed trading strategies for a living are very

00:01:07.519 --> 00:01:09.334
professional about making backtests

00:01:09.334 --> 00:01:12.409
because they really don't want their strategies to blow up.

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.709
The goal of strategy development is to optimize

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:19.114
the potential performance of what is yet to come in the future,

00:01:19.114 --> 00:01:21.484
in other words, what hasn't happened yet.

00:01:21.484 --> 00:01:26.194
When used appropriately, a backtest can be a useful means towards that end.

00:01:26.194 --> 00:01:27.914
When not used appropriately,

00:01:27.915 --> 00:01:31.670
a backtest can also be a hindrance or counterproductive,

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.885
especially if it convinces the modeler of something that isn't true.

00:01:35.885 --> 00:01:38.719
One must always keep in mind that the goal is to

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:42.394
optimize the performance of the strategy next year

00:01:42.394 --> 00:01:45.259
and the year after that and so on and

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.325
not to optimize the backtest appearance of performance.

00:01:49.325 --> 00:01:53.030
A backtest must report among other metrics,

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.825
a number of dollars or euros or other currency

00:01:56.825 --> 00:02:01.745
representing the simulated profit and loss in each time period.

00:02:01.745 --> 00:02:04.640
Even if the strategy trades intraday,

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.234
the profit and loss is often aggregated up to the daily level for reporting purposes,

00:02:10.234 --> 00:02:13.105
we call this the profit calculation.

00:02:13.104 --> 00:02:15.829
Like anything, the profit calculation can be

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.260
done with varying levels of accuracy and realism.
