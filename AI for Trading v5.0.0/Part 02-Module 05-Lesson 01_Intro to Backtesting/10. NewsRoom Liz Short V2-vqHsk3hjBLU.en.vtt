00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.845
Great to see you again Gordon,

00:00:01.845 --> 00:00:05.384
I have a few more questions for you about AI and finance.

00:00:05.384 --> 00:00:08.169
How is AI being used in finance today?

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:12.705
What applications have you seen used successfully or unsuccessfully?

00:00:12.705 --> 00:00:15.300
AI is being used in a lot of places.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.160
So first of all,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.740
some of the same technologies that are useful in

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:24.134
many industries such as image recognition are also very useful in finance.

00:00:24.135 --> 00:00:27.365
Just as the post office needs to recognize zip codes,

00:00:27.364 --> 00:00:31.143
banks need to recognize cheques,

00:00:31.143 --> 00:00:35.134
they need to recognize images of people for security purposes,

00:00:35.134 --> 00:00:40.369
firms that trade oil are using images of oil tankers

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:45.905
from satellite data to predict oil supply and demand et cetera.

00:00:45.905 --> 00:00:50.590
Beyond that, there are various machine learning technologies that deal with prediction.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.720
So, I think anything can appear intelligent if it

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.929
makes sufficiently accurate predictions.

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:00.079
So, examples there, it might include a prediction of whether

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:06.275
a given credit transaction will turn out to have been fraudulent based on its attributes.

00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:11.855
Another important example in finance there is algorithmic order execution.

00:01:11.855 --> 00:01:13.760
So, predicting whether or not

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.840
a given order placement strategy will actually result in the order getting filled,

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.585
is a prediction problem that AI has been applied to.

00:01:20.584 --> 00:01:23.674
Those are all examples of successful applications.

00:01:23.674 --> 00:01:29.729
Where I have not seen much success to date is applying AI to asset return prediction,

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.810
at least not without a lot of human guidance behind it.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.780
What advice would you give to someone looking to apply AI in finance?

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.370
Well, if you want to apply AI in finance,

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.344
you should definitely remember to consider the signal to noise ratio in the data,

00:01:44.344 --> 00:01:46.474
and the potential for overfitting.

00:01:46.474 --> 00:01:49.089
We talk about this a bit in the project.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.270
So traditionally, AI does not do very well in data

00:01:53.269 --> 00:01:58.144
scarce situations where you have relatively low signal-to-noise ratios.

00:01:58.144 --> 00:02:00.939
How do you think AI will change finance?

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:05.179
I think AI will change finance by enabling humans to sift through

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.800
and effectively utilize the petabytes of data that are now being created,

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.330
and use those data in their trading decisions.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.670
So for example, imagine a terminal that could show

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:20.679
you the exact news stories that are relevant to the problem you've been thinking about,

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.590
and predict a trade that you're likely to do based on that news,

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.640
and predict what the cost of that trade will be with various brokers.

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:29.054
So things like that.

00:02:29.055 --> 00:02:31.730
Right now, sifting and sorting through huge masses of

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:35.439
financial data is still not completely straightforward,

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:40.789
and I think firms like investment banks that have a lot of valuable data are only just

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:42.859
now learning how to collect it and

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.800
present it to their clients to help them make trading decisions.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.430
What types of career opportunities do you see now and

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.545
envision in the future for someone with skills in both AI and finance?

00:02:53.544 --> 00:02:56.599
I think there are lots and lots of career opportunities,

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.939
and there will be for the foreseeable future.

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:02.719
I don't think this is some passing fad.

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:06.699
In fact, I think every financial firm in the world,

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:11.314
if you talk to them they would most likely be able to find a prediction problem

00:03:11.314 --> 00:03:16.609
where they wish they can make predictions in an automated and more accurate way,

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.380
and that's essentially what machine learning is about.

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:23.549
Someone once said machine learning is prediction.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.860
For example, even something like mobile robot navigation is prediction.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.095
The robot is trying to predict what will happen if it moves its motors in a certain way.

00:03:32.094 --> 00:03:34.384
Well, that's all the questions I have.

00:03:34.384 --> 00:03:36.530
Thanks so much for talking with me Gordon.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.219
Thank you very much.
