00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
All right. So let's check out the solution.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.984
So for the first question,

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:11.730
it was asking us to create a column to say whether it's January or not.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.365
So we'll start with,

00:00:13.365 --> 00:00:15.449
and we can check out these examples here.

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:17.218
We'll start with our dataframe,

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:21.855
reference the index, and from the index we're going to get the level values.

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:24.539
Specify zero for the dates only,

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.960
and this is the month attribute.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.559
So when the month is equal to one for January,

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:34.634
this expression is now a series of Booleans,

00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:37.649
and we can just convert that into integer.

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.140
So we'll do something similar for December.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.119
To determine when is December,

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:44.765
we start with our dataframe,

00:00:44.765 --> 00:00:48.424
reference its index, get level values,

00:00:48.424 --> 00:00:50.500
zero for the dates.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.500
This is the month attribute.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.380
When the month is equal to 12 for December,

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.050
this is now a series of Booleans.

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:04.424
So we'll convert that to integers and add these as columns to the dataframe.

00:01:04.424 --> 00:01:07.875
Next, let's do weekday and quarter.

00:01:07.875 --> 00:01:11.659
So here's some example code that we can look at.

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.384
You can see that the weekday,

00:01:13.385 --> 00:01:15.010
goes from zero to four,

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.250
zero is Monday, four is Friday,

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.250
and the quarter goes from one to four.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.730
So let's first add the weekday.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.924
We'll start with our dataframe, index,

00:01:25.924 --> 00:01:32.799
get level values zero for the date.weekday.

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.789
Similarly, for all factors dot index,

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.300
dot get level values zero,

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.189
dot quarter, and all factors dot index,

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.054
dot get level values zero,

00:01:47.055 --> 00:01:50.060
dot year. All right?
