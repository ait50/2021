00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.894
We've seen that sector is a major factor that affects stock movements,

00:00:05.894 --> 00:00:09.390
we've also practice neutralizing sector exposure.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:15.405
The sector or industry classification of a stock can also be used as a feature.

00:00:15.404 --> 00:00:17.669
Other than the fact that stocks in

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.365
the same sector tend to move together in the same direction,

00:00:21.364 --> 00:00:25.039
it's also useful to know that certain Alpha factors may

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.939
be relevant or not relevant depending on the sector.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:35.090
For instance, a value factored doesn't make much sense for a bank because banks are

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.985
not valued in the same way as other companies

00:00:37.984 --> 00:00:41.435
that create and sell physical products or services.

00:00:41.435 --> 00:00:47.540
Return on sales would not apply the banks because they don't create and sell products.

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:49.219
Return on sales, however,

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.174
would likely apply to consumer companies.

00:00:52.174 --> 00:00:54.649
By including the sector as a feature,

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.039
we can train a model to learn when some other factors are

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.039
relevant or not relevant to stocks in each sector.
