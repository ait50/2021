00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
So the quizzes, we're going to create another column,

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.689
and actually one column for each category.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.835
So please choose column names that look like this,

00:00:08.835 --> 00:00:12.960
sector _code_, and then the category.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.900
Then, store the value as one when the row

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.949
matches the sector code of that column and zero otherwise.

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.304
So try it out in a for-loop here.

00:00:22.304 --> 00:00:25.425
So this is just looping through all the sector codes from

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:30.160
negative one to negative one all the way to 10.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.609
When you're done trying it out, go ahead and check out the solution video. Thanks.
