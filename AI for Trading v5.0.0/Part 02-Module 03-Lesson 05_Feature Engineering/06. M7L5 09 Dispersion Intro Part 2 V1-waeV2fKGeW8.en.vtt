00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.474
Once you've implemented market dispersion,

00:00:02.474 --> 00:00:05.210
create the object and apply

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:08.759
two separate smoothing operations using simple moving average.

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:10.844
You can click on the link for the documentation.

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:13.679
So one simple moving average is for one month,

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:14.849
which is 20 trading days,

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.440
and the other is for a six month,

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.600
which is 120 trading days.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.054
Then, you see there's code to add these two features to the pipeline.

00:00:23.054 --> 00:00:24.960
So just some quick hints.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.868
When you instantiate market dispersion,

00:00:27.868 --> 00:00:32.149
remember you probably need to set the mask to something.

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.634
When you implement simple moving average,

00:00:36.634 --> 00:00:40.730
you're going to be setting the inputs to something,

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:45.034
and you're going to be setting the window length to something.

00:00:45.034 --> 00:00:48.709
Okay? So these are just some hints to help you get started.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.570
Try it out yourself and when you're done,

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.570
check out the solution video. Thanks.
