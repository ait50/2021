00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.609
Here's a preview of what we'll learn next.

00:00:02.609 --> 00:00:05.009
You may have heard often how overfitting in

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.769
machine learning is a problem that we wish to avoid.

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:12.539
Over fitting with financial data is also a significant issue we have to deal

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:14.849
with If we hope for our models to perform

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.925
well and out-of-sample testing and in real trading.

00:00:17.925 --> 00:00:20.460
Let's look at how financial time series data,

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.344
in particular, may need special handling to address overfitting.

00:00:24.344 --> 00:00:30.794
We often want to train our model on a multi-day forward return, say, weekly returns.

00:00:30.795 --> 00:00:35.130
We do this because we expect the training and turnover to be lower than say,

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.130
a model trained on a single day for a return.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:46.035
We calculate weekly returned data from the most recent Monday and the prior Monday.

00:00:46.034 --> 00:00:47.934
Then, for the next return,

00:00:47.935 --> 00:00:53.015
we calculate the weekly return from the most recent Tuesday to the prior Tuesday.

00:00:53.015 --> 00:00:56.674
We repeat this for Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

00:00:56.674 --> 00:00:59.704
We could use each of these weekly returns,

00:00:59.704 --> 00:01:03.280
quantized, as our targets in a machine learning model.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.265
But recall that supervised learning models work better with independent observations.

00:01:09.265 --> 00:01:13.519
Let's think about the weekly returns data that are calculated every day.

00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:15.754
Do you notice something?

00:01:15.754 --> 00:01:20.269
The time periods of these weekly returns overlap.

00:01:20.269 --> 00:01:23.414
This is an issue called overlapping samples,

00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:26.210
and it leads to models that overfit on

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:31.429
the training data and therefore perform worse on the validation and test data.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.100
I'll cover ways to handle this.

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:37.394
You won't find this in any textbooks,

00:01:37.394 --> 00:01:40.289
and I'm really excited to share my insights with you.
