00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
Supervised Machine Learning models require training data,

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.689
that is, inputs and outputs.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.730
We call the inputs features,

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.070
and we call the outputs labels.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.070
Instead of feeding raw data into the model,

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.224
it's often helpful to use our domain knowledge to enhance those features,

00:00:18.224 --> 00:00:23.414
and also the labels to make them more meaningful to the Machine Learning model.

00:00:23.414 --> 00:00:29.140
This process of tailoring features and labels is called Feature Engineering.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.725
You've actually practiced a bit of Feature Engineering in past projects.

00:00:33.725 --> 00:00:37.649
For instance, converting price into returns,

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.964
and even calculating overnight returns using open and close prices.

00:00:41.965 --> 00:00:45.755
We'll look at some useful features that I often use

00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:50.160
as well as the rationale for creating these features and labels.
