00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
Hi everyone. We're going to calculate some market regime features,

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.995
and we're going to try to capture market wide regimes.

00:00:07.995 --> 00:00:12.884
Market wide means, we'll look at the aggregate movement of the entire universe of stocks.

00:00:12.884 --> 00:00:16.949
So we're calculating a single value for the entire universe of stocks.

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.634
First one is high and low dispersion,

00:00:19.635 --> 00:00:23.510
and dispersion is looking at the dispersion or standard deviation of

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.280
a cross section of all the stocks at each period of time.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.679
So that means if you were to plot the stock returns,

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.875
and look at a single slice on a single day,

00:00:33.875 --> 00:00:36.810
then you want to see how spread apart are those returns.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.075
If they're very spread apart,

00:00:38.075 --> 00:00:39.995
then there's higher dispersion.

00:00:39.994 --> 00:00:45.179
So first quiz which will help you fill out this line of code,

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:49.835
is if the inputs to our market dispersion factor are daily returns.

00:00:49.835 --> 00:00:53.179
We plan to calculate the market dispersion on each day.

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:57.085
Then what should be the window length of the market dispersion class?

00:00:57.085 --> 00:01:00.615
So this is saying, how many rows of data

00:01:00.615 --> 00:01:04.954
should the number array be when it reaches the compute function.

00:01:04.954 --> 00:01:09.069
Okay. So to implement this function,

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:11.164
here are the formulas that you want to implement.

00:01:11.165 --> 00:01:14.660
So we're going to create a class that inherits from custom factor.

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.179
We're overriding the compute function,

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.430
which you see here to calculate

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.400
the population standard deviation of all the stocks over a specified window of time.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.205
So here this is just saying,

00:01:26.204 --> 00:01:30.784
take the average of the returns across all stocks in all time periods,

00:01:30.784 --> 00:01:35.750
and this is saying, calculate the variance and then take the square root.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.668
So that's the standard deviation,

00:01:37.668 --> 00:01:39.935
and thus market dispersion.

00:01:39.935 --> 00:01:44.450
One thing to keep in mind for any custom factor is that,

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.189
when you set the inputs this is an iterable.

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:50.250
So notice this is a list,

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.090
and everything that you put inside this list gets unpacked over here.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.460
So after these standard parameters then you can see anything after that.

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:05.780
These are the individual elements of that input being unpacked.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.939
So whatever daily returns is,

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.840
that's what you see here.
