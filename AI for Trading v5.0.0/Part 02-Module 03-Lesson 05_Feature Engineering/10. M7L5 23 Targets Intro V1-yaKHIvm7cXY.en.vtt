00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.129
Now, we're going to create the targets,

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.809
also called the labels.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.265
So we want the model to try to predict the go forward one week return.

00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:11.339
But instead of using the returns directly,

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:13.619
we want to convert them into quantiles.

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.894
The reason we want to do this is to make the target market neutral

00:00:17.894 --> 00:00:22.844
and also to normalize it to changing volatility and dispersion over time.

00:00:22.844 --> 00:00:28.019
So in other words, we're trying to make the target robust to changes in market regimes.

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.660
First, we're going to create a pipeline,

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.320
a new pipeline object for the target because we had another pipeline for the features.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.865
Here's an example of what we want to do.

00:00:37.865 --> 00:00:40.270
We create a returns object.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.935
Because it's weekly returns,

00:00:41.935 --> 00:00:44.660
we set a window length of five trading days and

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:48.064
also remember to set the mask to our defined universe.

00:00:48.064 --> 00:00:51.559
We use this quantiles function to convert

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.704
that into quantiles and we want to choose two quantiles.

00:00:55.704 --> 00:00:58.769
Then, we can add it to the target.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.075
So the quiz is asking you to do something quite similar,

00:01:02.075 --> 00:01:07.930
but convert the weekly returns into five quantiles which are also called quintiles.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.780
So go ahead and try this out,

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.980
create it, add it to the pipeline,

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.240
and then this code is already set to have

00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:18.094
you run the pipeline and you'll get the data from that.

00:01:18.094 --> 00:01:20.269
Once you're done trying it out,

00:01:20.269 --> 00:01:23.089
