00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
The term market regime is another way to describe

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.189
marketing additions that broadly affect how stocks behave during a period of time.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.859
Market regimes change over time,

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:15.449
so it's helpful to generate features that capture changes in these market conditions.

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.855
There are two market regime features that we will work with.

00:00:18.855 --> 00:00:23.475
One is market dispersion and the other is market volatility.

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:28.800
Market dispersion looks at the cross-section of stocks and how spread out they are.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.975
To think about this conceptually,

00:00:30.975 --> 00:00:36.274
we can just look at the top-performing and lowest-performing stock on a single day.

00:00:36.274 --> 00:00:39.625
The difference between them can vary from day-to-day.

00:00:39.625 --> 00:00:45.049
On days when the best and worst performing stock are not that much far apart,

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:50.329
there isn't much benefit from correctly choosing the correct stocks to go long or short.

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.049
On the other hand, on days when the best stock is doing

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:57.844
very well and the worst stock is doing very poorly,

00:00:57.844 --> 00:01:01.070
then choosing the correct stocks to go long or short

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.849
has a more significant impact on a fund's performance.

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:08.524
Market dispersion can be calculated as a standard deviation.

00:01:08.525 --> 00:01:10.385
To visualize this idea,

00:01:10.385 --> 00:01:14.120
we can think of looking at the Stock Universe on a single day

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.460
and seeing how dispersed or spread out they are from the center.

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:20.379
As with other features,

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:24.739
we will utilize time horizons of one and six months.

00:01:24.739 --> 00:01:30.259
Market dispersion measures how much investors are making a distinction between stocks.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
If cross-sectional dispersion is low,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.960
it means all stocks are correlated.

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:38.689
If a major company stock goes up,

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:40.129
others go with it.

00:01:40.129 --> 00:01:43.219
If cross-sectional dispersion is high,

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:47.155
the stocks are likely moving in different directions.

00:01:47.155 --> 00:01:49.474
So people are paying attention to

00:01:49.474 --> 00:01:54.750
idiosyncratic aspects of stocks rather than common factors of stocks.
