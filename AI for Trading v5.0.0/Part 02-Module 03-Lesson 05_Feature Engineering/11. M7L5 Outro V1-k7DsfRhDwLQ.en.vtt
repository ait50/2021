00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.089
Let's review what we've learned in this lesson.

00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:06.764
Machine learning models trained on features and targets.

00:00:06.764 --> 00:00:10.425
Features can be more general than Alpha factors,

00:00:10.425 --> 00:00:14.820
in that they can also be used for splitting on other features or vectors.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.175
Two universal quantum features are stock volatility and stock dollar volume.

00:00:20.175 --> 00:00:24.480
Two regime features are market volatility and market dispersion.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.954
Additional useful features or sector or industry and also date parts,

00:00:29.954 --> 00:00:32.384
such as the beginning or end of the week,

00:00:32.384 --> 00:00:34.350
month, quarter or year.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.965
Lastly, we learned to create targets by quantizing foray returns.

00:00:39.965 --> 00:00:43.715
This makes the targets robust to changes in market regimes,

00:00:43.715 --> 00:00:46.550
and also makes the targets [inaudible].
