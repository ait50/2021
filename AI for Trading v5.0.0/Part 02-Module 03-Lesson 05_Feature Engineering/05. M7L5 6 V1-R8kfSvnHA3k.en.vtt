00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.765
Features are slightly more general than alpha factors.

00:00:03.765 --> 00:00:07.349
Recall that alpha factors are signals that are ideally

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:12.719
predictive of whether future stock returns maybe positive or negative, and by how much.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.540
Features are similar, but they don't

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:18.765
have as high a requirement to be predictive on their own.

00:00:18.765 --> 00:00:22.230
A good feature is one that may be useful in combination

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.129
with other features perhaps used to split other features.

00:00:26.129 --> 00:00:30.274
In other words, a good feature can be a conditional factor.

00:00:30.274 --> 00:00:35.600
You may recall that concept of conditional factors such as idiosyncratic volatility,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.210
which on their own may not tell the direction of the future returns.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.120
However, in combination with other features or factors,

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:47.959
these conditional factors can be predictive of returns.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.799
Recall that idiosyncratic volatility could be interpreted as

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:55.519
magnifying the signal of some other momentum or reversal signal.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.380
So, features are like that and that when combined with other features,

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.960
they can be useful as alpha factors even

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.230
if they aren't sufficient as alpha factors on their own.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.734
I'll start off with sharing some of what I call universal quan features.

00:01:11.734 --> 00:01:14.629
Universal quan features are broadly useful for

00:01:14.629 --> 00:01:18.349
quan research and for input into machine learning models.

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:20.959
Two important ones I often see,

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:26.809
and that you'll practice making are stock volatility and stock dollar volume.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.740
Both of these can be interpreted as conditional factors that

00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:34.429
adjust the impact of some other predictive feature.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.470
For instance, high dollar volume over a window of time may indicate that

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:45.109
some momentum factor is more significant compared to when there's lower dollar volume.

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:50.780
Stock volatility is the variation of each stock's return over a specified time horizon.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.620
We will use one month and six month time horizons.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.885
So the one month and six month volatility of each stock can be a useful feature.

00:01:59.885 --> 00:02:04.640
Stock dollar volume is the dollar amount of trades over a time horizon.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.033
Again, we'll use one month and six month time horizons

00:02:09.033 --> 00:02:12.004
and take the daily average over these horizons.

00:02:12.004 --> 00:02:15.319
Each stock's average daily volume over a one month and

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.120
six month horizon can be a useful feature in a predictive model.
