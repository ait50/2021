00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
Okay. So now we're going to go over the solution to implement market dispersion.

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.809
So,the first question was,

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:10.484
what is the window length that we set for the market dispersion factor?

00:00:10.484 --> 00:00:14.609
When you think about it, we want to look at a single data time and

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:18.059
calculate the standard deviation across all the stocks for a single day.

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:21.314
So we actually want to set the window length equal to one,

00:00:21.315 --> 00:00:22.830
which means right here,

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:24.629
when we define the mark dispersion class,

00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:26.989
we reset the window length equal to one.

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:29.579
Next, we also want to calculate

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:34.259
the average of the returns across all the socks and all the time periods.

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:39.390
So that's just taking the average on the returns.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.789
Then we want to calculate the standard deviation,

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:49.365
so that would be the returns minus the mean returns,

00:00:49.365 --> 00:00:55.140
and all of that is going to be squared.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.480
Then you see here,

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:00.364
that we're just going to take the average across again,

00:01:00.365 --> 00:01:03.905
all the stocks and all the time periods,

00:01:03.905 --> 00:01:06.349
and then finally, that's the variance.

00:01:06.349 --> 00:01:08.089
So to get the standard deviation,

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.215
we take the square root of n. Okay.

00:01:13.215 --> 00:01:16.810
So once you've implemented the market dispersion class,

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.030
then you can instantiate it, so market dispersion.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.245
Remember, you want to set the mask equal to I defined universe,

00:01:27.245 --> 00:01:29.540
and we also want to calculate

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.415
the simple moving average of the dispersion to smooth it out.

00:01:33.415 --> 00:01:39.355
So one would be the 20-day moving average 20 trading days is one month.

00:01:39.355 --> 00:01:41.130
So looks simple moving average,

00:01:41.129 --> 00:01:43.114
you want to set the inputs equal to something,

00:01:43.114 --> 00:01:46.744
and we also want to set the window length equal to something.

00:01:46.745 --> 00:01:49.564
In this case, the inputs are going to be

00:01:49.564 --> 00:01:53.099
the dispersion object that we just instantiate it,

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:55.869
and the window length is going to be 20 trading days.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:01.993
Similarly, for the six months simple moving average, simple moving average,

00:02:01.993 --> 00:02:05.959
the input is going to be the dispersion feature that we just calculated,

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:10.055
and the window length is equal to a 120 trading days, which is six months.

00:02:10.055 --> 00:02:13.260
So,once you create those,

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:14.894
you can add those to the pipeline.

00:02:14.895 --> 00:02:17.100
All right. Thanks for watching,

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.310
and continue on with the lesson. Thanks.
