00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
Now, let's look at the data that goes in

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.285
the other end of the machine learning training process.

00:00:06.285 --> 00:00:09.449
These are the outputs that we want the model to learn.

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:12.449
They're often called labels or targets.

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.059
I'll refer to these as targets.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.335
If you think back to when we proposed and tested potential output factors,

00:00:19.335 --> 00:00:22.335
can you think of what the targets were in those cases?

00:00:22.335 --> 00:00:25.575
They were the forward returns of each stock.

00:00:25.574 --> 00:00:31.184
But recall that given the low signal to noise ratio typical of financial data,

00:00:31.184 --> 00:00:34.890
we may want to process the returns data into a signal that

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.939
is easier for the machine learning model to train on.

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:42.018
One way to simplify the targets would be to classify

00:00:42.018 --> 00:00:46.729
all the positive returns as one label and all the non-positive returns as

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:50.524
another label then the machine learning model would train to determine

00:00:50.524 --> 00:00:55.114
based on the inputs whether the following returns are positive or not.

00:00:55.115 --> 00:00:59.090
The downside to having just two classes is that the model can't distinguish

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.200
between small positive returns and very large positive returns.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.710
An approach that you may see in books or in the literature is to

00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:10.424
choose various thresholds and bucket the returns into,

00:01:10.424 --> 00:01:12.658
say, low positive returns,

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.040
medium positive returns, and high positive returns.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.360
This approach also runs into another issue which is namely,

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:23.804
what should these thresholds be?

00:01:23.805 --> 00:01:29.060
We may pick a threshold that neatly buckets the returns during one period.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.500
But if you recall,

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.900
market regimes are not constant.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.640
For example, the overall market volatility varies at different points in time,

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.019
and the market return is also changing over time.

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:45.679
Constant thresholds for bucketing these returns wouldn't give

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.835
us useful targets due to these market changes.

00:01:49.834 --> 00:01:52.569
We can think about why that is.

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:57.679
Let's say we have constant thresholds that have three categories for small, medium,

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.509
and large positive returns,

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.650
and another three categories for small,

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.265
medium, and large negative returns.

00:02:04.265 --> 00:02:09.259
If the market is rallying so that all the stock returns are positive,

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.074
then the targets all end up in the positive region.

00:02:14.074 --> 00:02:17.780
You may recall our discussion about the importance of neutralizing

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.680
major risk factors such as market and sector risks.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.409
Having constant thresholds does not allow us to create targets that are market neutral.

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:30.490
Can you think of what else we could try?

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.495
Well, there are lots of complex approaches to creating targets.

00:02:35.495 --> 00:02:39.080
The approach that follows is quite good at handling changing

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.594
market regimes and also benefits from a simple implementation.

00:02:43.594 --> 00:02:47.180
This approach is to quantize the target.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:54.170
In other words, categorize the targets into quantiles that are determined for each day.

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:58.405
This allows us to account for changing market volatility,

00:02:58.405 --> 00:03:02.120
market dispersion, and market risks.
