00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.865
Okay, so next here's the quiz.

00:00:02.865 --> 00:00:05.205
Create a numpy array that has one,

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:08.054
when the month is January and zero otherwise,

00:00:08.054 --> 00:00:11.564
and store it in a column in the all factors dataframe,

00:00:11.564 --> 00:00:16.244
and you'll add another similar column to indicate when the month is December, right?

00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:17.894
Okay, once you try that out,

00:00:17.894 --> 00:00:19.304
you'll do something similar,

00:00:19.304 --> 00:00:21.689
you can do weekdays and quarter as well,

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.480
so add columns to the all factors dataframe

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.125
that specifies the weekday, quarter, and year.

00:00:28.125 --> 00:00:31.370
So if we look at the documentation datetime index,

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.314
weekday, quarter, and year are also attributes that we can use.

00:00:35.314 --> 00:00:38.509
So here's year, weekday,

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:40.974
and quarter. All right.

00:00:40.975 --> 00:00:45.620
You can use these in a similar way that you use to the month variable.

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:48.079
If you get a little lost,

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.629
just check out the sample code here,

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.615
and also try to do the months first.

00:00:53.615 --> 00:00:59.054
All right. Now, this is just saying add those features for weekday,

00:00:59.054 --> 00:01:02.679
quarter, and year as columns in the dataframe.
