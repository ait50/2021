00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.775
Market volatility is the volatility of the stock universe over a time horizon.

00:00:05.775 --> 00:00:11.339
Varying levels of market volatility may affect how stock selection strategies perform.

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:16.125
For instance, during the financial crisis originating in September 2008,

00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:21.929
there was high market volatility in every asset class and across virtually all stocks.

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:25.559
If you simulate a meaner version signal during this period,

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:28.754
you will see that it performed very well.

00:00:28.754 --> 00:00:30.469
Why is that?

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:32.149
We can't say for sure,

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:33.740
but we can posit that when risk is

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.630
high market participants manage that risk by trading more.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.835
When market participants trade more,

00:00:39.835 --> 00:00:45.245
they create temporary market impact which reverts when their liquidity demand dries up.

00:00:45.244 --> 00:00:49.399
On the other hand, during low volatility periods you

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.134
might expect to see factors that depend on company fundamentals do well.

00:00:53.134 --> 00:00:56.119
Again, we can say for certain why this is,

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:59.945
but logically one could posit that in periods of lower volatility,

00:00:59.945 --> 00:01:03.320
idiosyncratic developments in company fundamentals

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.234
are not drowned out by market-wide high volatility.

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:11.030
One way to generate a signal that indicates a shift into

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.980
high market volatility is by comparing short-term and long-term volatility.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.870
For example, one month is short-term and six month is long-term.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.790
When short-term volatility is higher than long-term volatility,

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:31.190
this can be a signal that the market has shifted into a high market volatility regime.

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.329
We could typically measure a rolling standard deviation of a market

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.819
ETF such as the S&amp;P 500 SPDR.

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:42.619
A way to approximate the market whoever is to take

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.969
the equal weighted average of all the stocks in the defined universe.

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:49.939
Then, calculate the standard deviation of

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.969
these returns over a time horizon such as one or six months.

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:01.204
Market volatility is a useful indicator of the state of the market over that time period.

00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:05.420
As just described, during periods of high market volatility and

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.905
mean reversion alpha factor and maybe more relevant for predicting future returns.

00:02:09.905 --> 00:02:12.814
Whereas during periods of low market volatility,

00:02:12.814 --> 00:02:16.319
fundamental factors may be more relevant.
