00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.554
Okay. So now we're going to add the sector as a feature.

00:00:04.554 --> 00:00:07.544
So note that this variable here,

00:00:07.544 --> 00:00:08.990
that we're adding to the pipeline,

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.810
we had actually set earlier above.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.570
So if I scroll back up to the make factor section,

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.640
that's at the beginning of the notebook.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.740
I can also search sector,

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:19.729
just so I can highlight where it is.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.160
So I scroll back up and in this section, make factors,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.545
and within this cell,

00:00:24.545 --> 00:00:29.245
you can see that I said sector is equal to project_helper.Sector.

00:00:29.245 --> 00:00:34.149
Okay. So this was setting this variable so that

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:39.729
each stock ticker has a particular sector category associated with it.

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:44.334
We use this inside some of these factors to demean by sector,

00:00:44.335 --> 00:00:46.100
for example, in this case.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.399
But now we're going to add it to the pipeline to use as a feature itself.

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.710
So if I go back to the sector and industry section right here,

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.370
we're just going to add this sector to the pipeline,

00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:01.140
and then we're also going to run the pipeline,

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.510
so that we can actually extract the data into this dataframe, all factors.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.564
So you can see here there's a couple of factors here and features that we've created,

00:01:10.564 --> 00:01:12.939
and there's also the sector code right here.

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:16.293
Notice these are numbers representing the categories,

00:01:16.293 --> 00:01:19.670
and so because we know this is a categorical variable,

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.859
we're going to one-hot encoded because these numbers don't have a real ordering.
