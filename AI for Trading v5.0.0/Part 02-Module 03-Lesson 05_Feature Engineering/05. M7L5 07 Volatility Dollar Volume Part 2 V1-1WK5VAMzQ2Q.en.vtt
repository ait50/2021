00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.725
So, here's a quiz.

00:00:01.725 --> 00:00:04.650
We can see that the returns window length is two,

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.945
because we are dealing with daily returns,

00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:10.140
which are calculated as the percent change from one day to the following day.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.985
So, it's two days.

00:00:11.984 --> 00:00:17.024
The annualized volatility window length is 252 by default,

00:00:17.024 --> 00:00:19.214
because it's the one-year volatility.

00:00:19.214 --> 00:00:20.579
So, that means it's using

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:27.644
252 returns sample points in calculating the standard deviation of that.

00:00:27.644 --> 00:00:31.679
So, now the question is, try to adjust the call to the constructor of

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.075
annualized volatility so that this represents one-month volatility.

00:00:36.075 --> 00:00:37.875
So, it's still annualized,

00:00:37.875 --> 00:00:41.359
but it's calculated over time window of 20 trading days.

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:43.234
So, what I mean by that is,

00:00:43.234 --> 00:00:47.590
when you look at the function here.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.430
So, if you were to change it so that the window length is 20,

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:55.219
to represent 20 trading days or one month,

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:02.810
then imagine you would have a DataFrame in here that has 20 rows instead of 252 rows,

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.545
and it uses that to calculate the standard deviation.

00:01:06.545 --> 00:01:09.680
So, I can give you a quick hint.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:16.845
Start with annualized volatility and window length equals something.

00:01:16.844 --> 00:01:20.745
Okay. All right.

00:01:20.745 --> 00:01:23.454
So, after you do that,

00:01:23.454 --> 00:01:29.004
the next quiz is, create one month and six month annualized volatility.

00:01:29.004 --> 00:01:34.384
Create annualized volatility objects for a 20 day and 120 day time windows.

00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:37.505
In other words, one month and six month time windows.

00:01:37.504 --> 00:01:43.239
Remember to set the mask parameters to the universe object created earlier.

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:46.909
So, this filters the stocks to match the list in the universe.

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.519
So, this means that, we don't want to use all the stocks,

00:01:49.519 --> 00:01:52.670
we want to filter to a certain list of

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.859
stock tickers in this universe object we actually created back up here.

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:03.500
So, we'll take a look. So, based on the average dollar volume over the past six months,

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.540
over the past 120 trading days,

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.390
take the top 500,

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:11.994
and that's the list of tickers that we'll use here.

00:02:11.995 --> 00:02:16.710
So, we could actually just double check what it looks like.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.015
So, universe is this object,

00:02:23.014 --> 00:02:26.379
but you can actually just pass it in here.

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.305
I'll give you a hint here.

00:02:28.305 --> 00:02:30.575
So, we had annualized volatility.

00:02:30.574 --> 00:02:33.994
Okay. We can set the window length

00:02:33.995 --> 00:02:38.200
equal to something and we can set the mask equal to something.

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:42.544
It also says, convert these two ranks and convert those ranks to scores.

00:02:42.544 --> 00:02:50.734
So, you may recall that there's a rank function and there's a zscore function.

00:02:50.735 --> 00:02:53.640
So, those are some hints.

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:56.804
Once you store those into variables,

00:02:56.805 --> 00:03:00.129
then go ahead and add them to the pipeline.
