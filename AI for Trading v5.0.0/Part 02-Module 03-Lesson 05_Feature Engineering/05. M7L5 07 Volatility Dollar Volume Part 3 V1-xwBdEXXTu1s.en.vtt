00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.930
So next, here's the Average Dollar Volume feature.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:05.849
So we've been using the Average Dollar Volume in

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:08.955
the past to use that to choose the stock universe.

00:00:08.955 --> 00:00:14.474
So based off of the stocks that have the most dollar volume over a certain time period,

00:00:14.474 --> 00:00:16.574
we choose those stock tickers.

00:00:16.574 --> 00:00:21.314
We can also use this as a feature that's input into the predictive model.

00:00:21.315 --> 00:00:22.800
So the question is,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.825
please use 20 day and 120 day window_lengths for average dollar volume,

00:00:27.824 --> 00:00:30.030
and also convert the average dollar volumes into

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.465
ranks and convert those ranks into zscores.

00:00:33.465 --> 00:00:35.790
So as an example,

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:39.390
we would have AverageDollarVolume.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.390
We set the window_length to something.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.405
We set the mask equal to something.

00:00:45.405 --> 00:00:52.630
Remember, there's also a rank and a zscore function.

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:56.914
So we'll stop there. Go ahead and try it out.

00:00:56.914 --> 00:00:58.414
Then when you're done,

00:00:58.414 --> 00:01:02.679
you can also look at the solution video that's coming up next. Thanks.
