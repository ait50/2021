00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.855
Hi, everyone. Welcome to lesson on Feature Engineering and Labeling.

00:00:05.855 --> 00:00:10.990
Here's the notebook that we'll use to practice coding for this entire lesson.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.134
So, I'll just read this section for you,

00:00:13.134 --> 00:00:14.839
feature engineering and labeling.

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:20.289
We'll use the price volume data and generate features that we can feed into a model.

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.619
Will use this notebook for all the coding exercises of this lesson.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.335
So, please open this notebook in a separate tab of your browser.

00:00:27.335 --> 00:00:30.280
Then after that, please, run the following code up to and

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.535
including Make Factors. I'll show you this later.

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:35.379
Then continue on with the lesson.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.045
Okay. So, what I mean is,

00:00:37.045 --> 00:00:39.265
in your classroom you can go here,

00:00:39.265 --> 00:00:44.414
you can right-click and open the link in a new tab.

00:00:44.414 --> 00:00:49.460
So, that you'll still have this original classroom to watch the videos,

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.189
and you'll have a separate tab where you'll be able to work on the code.

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:59.644
Okay. Also if you don't want to see these horizontal bars on the top and bottom.

00:00:59.645 --> 00:01:03.290
You can also hover your mouse over the Jupyter icon,

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.025
right-click and open that link in a new tab.

00:01:06.025 --> 00:01:09.755
So, now you won't have those horizontal headers anymore.

00:01:09.754 --> 00:01:12.274
We're working on that notebook feature engineering,

00:01:12.275 --> 00:01:15.630
can the other notebooks, we'll see in a later lesson.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.215
Okay. So, it says please run the following code up to and including Make Factors.

00:01:21.215 --> 00:01:24.689
So, that means just run all these cells.

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:31.129
Okay, up to and including Make Factors.

00:01:31.129 --> 00:01:36.694
So, here are just factors that we've seen in a previous project, okay.

00:01:36.694 --> 00:01:41.909
So, we're just going to be using those for our coding exercise.

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.304
Now, says, stop here and continue on with the lesson. So, that's what we'll do.

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:47.180
So, if you want,

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.760
you can close this version of the notebook,

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.570
because we already have the notebook here.

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:54.859
Note, that for the first time you're running this,

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:57.140
the pip install will take about eight to nine minutes.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.385
So, just how that running in a separate tab while you continue on with the lesson.

00:02:01.385 --> 00:02:03.609
Okay, thanks.
