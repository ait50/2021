00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.984
So now, let's look at the solution to calculate targets.

00:00:03.984 --> 00:00:06.324
So we created the pipeline.

00:00:06.325 --> 00:00:09.990
Here's the example where we're adding one target,

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.210
which is converting the returns into 2-quantiles and adding to the pipeline.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.730
So here we're going to do something quite similar.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.815
We're going to create the returns.

00:00:19.815 --> 00:00:23.790
The window length is five trading days for one week as before.

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.445
Set the mask to our defined universe,

00:00:26.445 --> 00:00:28.304
and use the quantiles function.

00:00:28.304 --> 00:00:31.320
This time we want to choose 5-quantiles.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.564
We can go ahead and add that to the pipeline that we created, pipeline target.

00:00:38.564 --> 00:00:41.909
We're adding this quantized returns object.

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:45.149
Return five day, 5-quantiles,

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:52.045
and then I'll just give the column name the same name.

00:00:52.045 --> 00:00:56.510
Then, we already have code here that will run the pipeline and put the data into

00:00:56.509 --> 00:01:00.949
this dataframe. All right.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.465
So you can see now we have two columns,

00:01:04.465 --> 00:01:08.640
five-day, 2-quantile and five-day, 5-quantile.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.500
Great. Thanks for watching.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.260
