00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.345
Okay. So let's look at the solution to these quizzes.

00:00:03.345 --> 00:00:05.849
So the first quiz was,

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:09.869
the annualized volatility window length is 252 by default,

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:11.910
because it's the one-year volatility.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.280
Try to adjust the call to the constructor of

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:18.554
annualized volatility so that this represents one month volatility.

00:00:18.554 --> 00:00:24.269
Okay. So we can call the constructor annualized volatility.

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.329
But instead, we'll update

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:33.905
the window length to be 20 trading days which represents one month.

00:00:33.905 --> 00:00:36.259
So this means that it's going to use

00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:42.329
20 returns observations and calculating the standard deviation,

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.589
and that's the annualized volatility over a 20 day period or one month period.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.420
So now this is saying,

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.039
to store these into variables,

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.179
create the annualized volatility object for 20 days and 120 days.

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:58.640
That's one month and six month time windows.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.880
Also remember to set the mass parameters to the universe.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.850
Okay? So that means we want to create annualized volatility.

00:01:07.849 --> 00:01:10.189
By the way, I'm just hitting the tab button in order

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.549
to auto-complete this in Jupyter Notebooks.

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:18.079
So window length for one month is 20 trading days.

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:20.614
We want to set the mask equal to universe.

00:01:20.614 --> 00:01:23.089
Okay? We also want to rank it.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.380
So we want to convert these volatilities into ranks,

00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:30.049
and we want to convert those ranks into Z scores.

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.869
Okay? So we're going to do something similar here

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.469
for the sixth month annualized volatility.

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:41.209
We're going to set the window length this time to a 120 trading days.

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:47.189
The mask filters the other tickers to be on those in the universe,

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.489
and also convert those into ranks and convert those ranks into Z scores.

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:59.044
Okay. We're just going to add those to the pipeline as well.

00:01:59.045 --> 00:02:01.275
Okay. The next quiz.

00:02:01.275 --> 00:02:04.125
So average dollar volume, okay?

00:02:04.125 --> 00:02:07.980
We want to create features out of that as well.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.325
So average dollar volume.

00:02:10.324 --> 00:02:14.780
We want, again, one month and six month time period.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.395
So we set the window length to 20 for here.

00:02:18.395 --> 00:02:21.330
Also remember to set the mask.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.280
We want to convert the average dollar volume into ranks

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.205
and convert those ranks into Z scores.

00:02:28.205 --> 00:02:34.930
So similarly, average dollar volume for a six month period is a 120 trading days.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.515
The mask is also going to filter by the tickers,

00:02:39.514 --> 00:02:42.484
the top 500 tickers by average dollar volume.

00:02:42.485 --> 00:02:46.280
We're going to convert those average dollar volumes into

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.745
ranks and also convert those ranks into Z scores, okay?

00:02:50.745 --> 00:02:55.055
Again, we're going to add these features to the pipeline as well.

00:02:55.055 --> 00:03:00.395
Great. So now you can continue on with the lesson which will

00:03:00.395 --> 00:03:06.330
then introduce you to the other parts that you'll see in this notebook. Okay? Thanks.
