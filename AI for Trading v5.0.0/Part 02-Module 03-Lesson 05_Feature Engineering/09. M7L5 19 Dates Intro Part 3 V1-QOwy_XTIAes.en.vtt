00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
So next, this is also going to look at the start and end of particular date ranges.

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.699
So, the start and end of the week, month,

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:12.404
and quarter may have structural differences in trading activity.

00:00:12.404 --> 00:00:15.689
So we're going to use pandas.daterange here.

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:18.554
So here's the documentation for that.

00:00:18.554 --> 00:00:24.030
Okay. So it takes three parameters: start date,

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.535
end date, and also frequency.

00:00:26.535 --> 00:00:29.730
The frequency for end of the month is BM,

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.094
which you can look at in other documentation which is the time-series frequency.

00:00:34.094 --> 00:00:37.829
Okay. So here you can see that

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.060
BM is the code to say we want to get the end of the business month.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.045
Okay. So that's the frequency that we would use.

00:00:47.045 --> 00:00:48.995
Okay. So here's an example.

00:00:48.994 --> 00:00:51.839
So if we were to say pd.daterange,

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.415
so I'm going to try this in new cell, pd, pandas.daterange,

00:00:56.414 --> 00:01:03.079
and we're just going to say from the start is here,

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.579
and then the end is date.

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:11.849
Okay. We're going to set the frequency equal to enter the business month.

00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:14.125
Okay. So what does that do?

00:01:14.125 --> 00:01:16.819
Notice here that these dates represent

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:21.689
the last business day of that particular month, all right?
