00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
Okay. Let's take a look at the solution.

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.800
First of all, we're just running this through a loop.

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.849
So just to remind you that we're actually looping through,

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.369
and this letter S is just storing those sector categories which are these integers.

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:20.280
So first of all, we want to check if it's equal to that particular sector.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.970
So remember we're looking at the all factors DataFrame,

00:00:23.969 --> 00:00:27.564
and we're looking at the column sector code,

00:00:27.565 --> 00:00:31.304
when it's equal to S. Then,

00:00:31.304 --> 00:00:34.304
this thing itself returns a series of Booleans.

00:00:34.304 --> 00:00:37.005
We're just going to convert that to an integer type.

00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:39.810
Okay. That's what we were doing up here,

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.545
we took this equals operator which gives us a series of Booleans,

00:00:43.545 --> 00:00:46.245
we convert that into integer.

00:00:46.244 --> 00:00:50.954
Let's just store this in another column, so all factors.

00:00:50.954 --> 00:00:53.219
Let's give it a certain column names.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.009
I'm going to use the F-string in Python.

00:00:56.009 --> 00:01:03.884
Sector code and S in curly braces.

00:01:03.884 --> 00:01:06.814
So let's take a look at what happens there.

00:01:06.814 --> 00:01:10.054
If I look at the columns now,

00:01:10.055 --> 00:01:11.970
then if it worked out okay.

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:15.359
You can see here now I've sector code two, three, four,

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:19.049
five, all the way to 10 negative one.

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.439
Great. Please continue on with the lesson. Cheers.
