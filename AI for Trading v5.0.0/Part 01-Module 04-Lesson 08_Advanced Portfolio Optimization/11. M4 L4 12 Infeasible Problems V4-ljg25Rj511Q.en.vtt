00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.679
Remember how earlier we talked about the possibility of setting yourself a problem that

00:00:04.679 --> 00:00:09.535
doesn't have a solution because there is no answer that satisfies all the constraints?

00:00:09.535 --> 00:00:11.884
Well, that can happen in practice.

00:00:11.884 --> 00:00:14.775
When you're working with two or three dimensional problems

00:00:14.775 --> 00:00:17.820
where you can graph the functions and observe what's going on,

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.998
it might be easier to see when the problem becomes infeasible.

00:00:20.998 --> 00:00:23.219
However, in practice you're working in

00:00:23.219 --> 00:00:27.429
a high-dimensional space where it's hard to visualize what's going on.

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:32.039
In general learning what makes the problem infeasible comes with experience.

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:34.604
So, much of this might sound rather abstract,

00:00:34.604 --> 00:00:38.359
but we want to have a short discussion here to give you an intuition.

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:41.479
One possible situation where this might arise,

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:44.324
is if you fix the weight on a particular stock.

00:00:44.325 --> 00:00:47.870
For example, sometimes for some reason the compliance group at

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:51.679
your company may restrict trading company wide on a particular stock.

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:54.049
So, there may be some stock that you can't

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:58.354
trade or there may be a particular stock that's difficult to short,

00:00:58.354 --> 00:01:01.549
so again, you'd like to constrain the weight on that stock.

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:06.015
However, if you put a hard constraint on the weight on that particular stock,

00:01:06.015 --> 00:01:10.614
this might cause you to reach an infeasible solution in your optimization problem.

00:01:10.614 --> 00:01:13.984
Let's just say first that it's often dangerous to put

00:01:13.984 --> 00:01:16.609
equality constraints in an optimization problem

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:19.385
because the problem can get infeasible very easily.

00:01:19.385 --> 00:01:21.500
Remember that inequality constraint is

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.575
a much stronger condition than an inequality constraint.

00:01:24.575 --> 00:01:27.109
It's the difference between requiring that they answer

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:30.295
lie on a line or below a line, for example.

00:01:30.295 --> 00:01:33.560
Infeasibility is an issue with your constraints.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.570
One possible solution is to move

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:39.719
one or more constraints to penalty terms in the objective function.

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:42.905
This changes the problem from placing a hard limit

00:01:42.905 --> 00:01:46.200
on some quantity to seeking to minimize that quantity,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.874
but balanced against the other terms in the objective.

00:01:49.873 --> 00:01:53.045
So, what are general rules of thumb or

00:01:53.045 --> 00:01:56.405
guidelines for avoiding these situations in practice?

00:01:56.405 --> 00:02:00.230
In production you're inheriting a live portfolio.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:06.180
Your job in optimization is to transition that portfolio to a new state using new data,

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.170
new Alpha factors, and keeping in mind that

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:13.405
market movements have caused the old weights to change slightly.

00:02:13.405 --> 00:02:15.530
The first thing to check is whether

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.270
the starting portfolio produces an infeasible problem or not.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.534
In general start with fewer terms in the objective function.

00:02:23.534 --> 00:02:25.715
If that problem becomes infeasible,

00:02:25.715 --> 00:02:30.280
try to figure out which constraints are the ones causing the infeasibility,

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.054
see if you can change or override any of those constraints.

00:02:34.054 --> 00:02:38.800
Finally, consider moving constraints to penalty terms in the objective function.
