00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.435
Another important constraint is the leverage constraints.

00:00:03.435 --> 00:00:08.365
With this constraint, we limit the leverage ratio which, as you recall,

00:00:08.365 --> 00:00:12.265
is the sum of the absolute dollar value of all positions,

00:00:12.265 --> 00:00:14.190
long and short, divided by

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:18.410
whatever actual capital we devote to supporting those positions.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.070
In our portfolio optimization problem,

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.579
we work with portfolio weights which are percentages of total invested capital,

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:29.729
so the leverage ratio is just the sum of

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.210
the absolute value of the weights, long and short.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.039
Again, we discussed this when we discussed alpha factors,

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:39.929
but the basic idea here is that when you short stocks,

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:43.465
you borrow the stocks and sell them on the open market.

00:00:43.465 --> 00:00:47.885
You can use the cash you get to take long positions on other stocks.

00:00:47.884 --> 00:00:51.289
In general, any investment position is said to

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.674
be leveraged if it is financed by a debt position.

00:00:54.674 --> 00:00:58.899
Whether it's financed by borrowed cash or borrowed stocks.

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:01.864
However, it would be much more risky to take

00:01:01.865 --> 00:01:06.609
very large short positions in order to finance very large long positions.

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:10.159
These are large bets and shorting can be complicated.

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.489
If the leverage ratio is allowed to be greater than one,

00:01:13.489 --> 00:01:16.819
it means the total magnitude of all year long and short

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:21.974
positions is greater than the amount of initial capital that you have to work with.

00:01:21.974 --> 00:01:27.280
This means you're borrowing money either by shorting more stocks or by borrowing cash.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.400
You have to borrow from somebody and they'll have a maximum there willing to lend to you.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.040
So, you place a constraint on your leverage ratio which is the sum of

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.200
the absolute values of all your positions to control the scale of this borrowing.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.640
This will keep you from ending up in a very extreme leverage position.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.189
If you're using an objective function like

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:54.144
this and you are not using a risk constraint like this,

00:01:54.144 --> 00:01:56.194
you need a constraint like

00:01:56.194 --> 00:01:59.759
the leverage constraint to keep your weights from growing to infinity.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.170
You can try to control leverage by just controlling risk,

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.879
but the leverage constraint is usually

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:09.349
a hard constraint that will also be necessary to enforce.
