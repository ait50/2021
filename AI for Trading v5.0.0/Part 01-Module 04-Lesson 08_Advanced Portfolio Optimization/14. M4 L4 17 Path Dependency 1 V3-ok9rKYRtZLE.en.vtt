00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
Why will two portfolios employing the same underlying strategy run on the same as at

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.935
universe during the same period yield

00:00:09.935 --> 00:00:13.995
a different portfolio if started at different points in time?

00:00:13.994 --> 00:00:17.429
The reason is that transitions between different sets

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:21.175
of portfolio weights can be more or less costly.

00:00:21.175 --> 00:00:27.450
Consider two portfolios trying to make the same transition to the same ideal portfolio.

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.594
A starting portfolio close to this portfolio might be directed here,

00:00:32.594 --> 00:00:36.625
but one starting from farther away might be directed elsewhere.

00:00:36.625 --> 00:00:41.945
For example; say I start my strategy on January 1 and the signal says,

00:00:41.945 --> 00:00:43.905
go long Apple 10 percent.

00:00:43.905 --> 00:00:46.914
So, I enter this 10 percent long position,

00:00:46.914 --> 00:00:49.394
then later on June 1,

00:00:49.395 --> 00:00:52.930
the ideal position is to go short Apple 10 percent.

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:57.439
If I've imposed a turnover constraint or penalty in the problem,

00:00:57.439 --> 00:01:01.280
the optimizer may not conclude that it's actually ideal to enter

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.560
this 10 percent short position because

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.629
it's too far away from the position I'm already in.

00:01:06.629 --> 00:01:10.689
However, if my way on Apple was previously zero,

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:15.674
it may tell me that the best next step is to go 10 percent short on Apple.

00:01:15.674 --> 00:01:19.909
This could even happen for portfolio started at the same time but

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.054
holding different amounts of capital if they have a liquidity constraint.

00:01:24.055 --> 00:01:27.680
A liquidity constraint means that we restrict our positions to be

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.890
below some percent of each asset's daily trade volume.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.420
If two portfolios have different capital amounts than

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.734
the smaller capital portfolio is less constrained by a liquidity constraint.

00:01:39.734 --> 00:01:44.780
For example, if you have some small stock that trades one million dollars per day,

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.299
and you have a small portfolio that wants to take

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.784
a 10 percent or 100k position in that stock,

00:01:50.784 --> 00:01:54.429
which is 10 percent of its volume, that would be okay.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.850
But if you had a $100 million portfolio and the same Alpha vector,

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:04.179
then that portfolio would want to take a $10 million position in the stock,

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.885
which would be 10 times its daily volume,

00:02:06.885 --> 00:02:10.500
and so you'd only be able to take a very tiny position.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.840
So, ultimately, due to these trading constraints,

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.300
the final portfolio weights of these portfolios would be very different.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.570
In practice, you may see this effect if you run the same strategy for different clients.

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.284
Their portfolios may net different returns.

00:02:26.284 --> 00:02:29.194
This is the surprising but very common feature.

00:02:29.194 --> 00:02:31.685
It also affects backtesting.

00:02:31.685 --> 00:02:34.278
We've talked about backtesting only a little,

00:02:34.278 --> 00:02:37.849
but you'll recall that it involves rigorously simulating,

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.074
trading a portfolio by testing on historical data.

00:02:41.074 --> 00:02:45.524
This type of simulation involves a lot of data and a lot of steps.

00:02:45.525 --> 00:02:47.659
You may want to speed it up by running parts of

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.819
the computation in parallel across many computers.

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.639
However, this is difficult because each step of the computation where we calculate what

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:57.679
the portfolio would be at each point in

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.875
time is in practice dependent on the previous stage.

00:03:01.875 --> 00:03:04.625
We call this path dependency.

00:03:04.625 --> 00:03:09.439
However, for portfolios of the same size over long periods of time,

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:14.770
like years, you would expect the paths of the portfolios to rejoin each other.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.719
People have attempted creative solutions to this difficulty.

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:23.300
They may run simulations of 18-month windows of time that have

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.005
six months of overlap on different machines with the whole simulation spanning 10 years.

00:03:29.004 --> 00:03:31.685
Then, they chop off three months on

00:03:31.685 --> 00:03:35.740
either end of each simulation and stitch these together.
