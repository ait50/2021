00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740
Wow. Just wow.

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.270
I am really proud of you.

00:00:04.269 --> 00:00:08.384
You made it through factor models and all the portfolio optimization content.

00:00:08.384 --> 00:00:11.609
This is tough stuff, no bones about it.

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:13.934
This is a huge accomplishment on your part,

00:00:13.935 --> 00:00:15.750
and I congratulate you.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.449
Maybe, take a few minutes and think back to

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.564
everything you have learned since you started this Nanodegree.

00:00:21.565 --> 00:00:24.820
Back in the beginning, we were talking about stock prices,

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.754
adjusting for corporate actions,

00:00:26.754 --> 00:00:30.160
Panda's time series operations but since then,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.780
you've created several trading strategies,

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.145
learned a number of modeling techniques,

00:00:35.145 --> 00:00:39.290
learned about portfolio optimization, and now, finally,

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:41.615
you're seeing how to put it all together into

00:00:41.615 --> 00:00:45.795
a real professional level institutional trading strategy,

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:48.475
drawing in novel ideas for Alphas.

00:00:48.475 --> 00:00:51.795
This is a huge progression.

00:00:51.795 --> 00:00:55.660
Onwards and upwards, time to put your knowledge to work.

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:00.519
This project is truly top notch and I think you'll learn a lot by getting through it.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.950
I'm excited for you. I hope you enjoyed it.
