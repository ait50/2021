00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.660
Another common type of constraint limits the extent to

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.370
which you are exposed to any individual factor.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.664
This is where you might impose specific limitations

00:00:10.664 --> 00:00:13.844
on your exposure to common risk model factors.

00:00:13.845 --> 00:00:19.380
Individual sectors, momentum, value, or company size.

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:24.729
Remember that the factor exposure matrix has dimensions of assets and factors.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.875
When you multiply the transposed factor exposure matrix by the weight vector,

00:00:29.875 --> 00:00:31.899
which has dimensions of assets,

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:34.914
you get a vector that has dimensions of factors.

00:00:34.914 --> 00:00:38.409
Thus, this product is still a vector.

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:41.209
When we impose a constraint like this,

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.789
where this is a single scalar,

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.344
it means that the constraint applies to each element of the vector.

00:00:47.344 --> 00:00:51.019
That is, we apply the same constraint for every factor.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.940
Again, where do we get these constraint numbers from?

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:58.155
They come from business and risk mandates.

00:00:58.155 --> 00:01:03.049
Finally, it's common to place some ultimate constraints on the individual weights

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:06.200
themselves just to ensure that you don't end up in

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.805
very extreme positions in individual assets.

00:01:09.805 --> 00:01:14.610
Again, remember that the weight vector is a vector with dimensions of assets,

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:19.879
so placing a constraint like this applies to each asset weight in the vector.

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:23.644
You can think of this constraint as a kind of insurance.

00:01:23.644 --> 00:01:27.625
In theory, the risk model should help limit portfolio risk.

00:01:27.625 --> 00:01:30.239
But in case there's a problem with a risk model,

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:34.079
setting limits on how much weight to put on any single stock

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.974
also helps to protect the portfolio from concentrated risk exposure.

00:01:38.974 --> 00:01:41.629
This constraint is often impose so that

00:01:41.629 --> 00:01:44.839
the hedge fund can clearly communicate to investors that

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.450
there is an absolute limit on the extent to which

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.659
the portfolio is invested in any one asset.

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.319
This value could be quoted in fund prospectus documentation.
