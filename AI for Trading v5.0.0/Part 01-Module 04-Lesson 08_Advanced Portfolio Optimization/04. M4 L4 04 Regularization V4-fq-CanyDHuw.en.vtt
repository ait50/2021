00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.509
As of right now, we have this as our optimization objective function.

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:09.695
But there's one other term that it's a good idea to add to it at this point.

00:00:09.695 --> 00:00:12.794
This is what's called a regularization term.

00:00:12.794 --> 00:00:17.949
Here we use the L2 norm of the portfolio weights as the regularization term.

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:19.434
In other types of problems,

00:00:19.434 --> 00:00:21.224
you might use a different term.

00:00:21.225 --> 00:00:24.450
What this do? Well, as you'll recall,

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.149
the L2 norm of a vector is its length.

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:32.280
So, in this case, the term is basically the length of the vector of portfolio weights.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:38.460
This entire quantity will get very large if the weight on any single asset gets large.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.530
So, the effect is to penalize this behavior

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.109
and enforce the spreading of weight amongst assets.

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:49.310
The parameter here controls the balance between maximizing

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.740
the portfolio alpha and enforcing the spreading of the weights across assets.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.725
To further clarify this,

00:00:56.725 --> 00:01:00.564
let's imagine two possible extreme states of the world.

00:01:00.564 --> 00:01:05.144
In the first, you feel maximally confident in your alpha factors.

00:01:05.144 --> 00:01:11.170
You know for sure which stocks are going to go up and down in the future and by how much.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.530
In this situation you'd put all your long money in the stocks that will go

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.534
up the most and all your short money in the stocks that will go down the most.

00:01:20.534 --> 00:01:22.864
In the second extreme state,

00:01:22.864 --> 00:01:25.219
you are absolutely sure that you know which

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:28.049
stocks are going to go up and which are going to go down,

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.084
but you don't know by how much.

00:01:30.084 --> 00:01:32.699
You only know the sign of the change.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.159
So, in this case,

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.590
the optimal portfolio is equal weight on all the stocks you take long positions on,

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.950
and equal weight on all the stocks you take short positions on.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.260
You can think of the regularization parameter as a dial that you can use to

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.035
tune between these two extreme versions of your prior knowledge of the world.

00:01:53.034 --> 00:01:56.484
This is the Bayesian interpretation of this technique.

00:01:56.484 --> 00:01:59.265
If you set the parameter equal to zero,

00:01:59.265 --> 00:02:02.820
that's the state where you have full confidence in the alpha vector.

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:05.274
As the parameter approaches infinity,

00:02:05.275 --> 00:02:07.855
the output weights approach equal weighting.

00:02:07.855 --> 00:02:12.280
So, you can think of the regularization parameter as your conviction dial.
