00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
Let's think for a moment why what we've come up with now is

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.974
superior to the way we were doing optimization before.

00:00:06.974 --> 00:00:08.939
Remember how before we had

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:14.570
this large covariance matrix of assets that we were using to estimate portfolio variance.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.170
Well, now we have a smaller number of factors.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.765
Common commercial risk models have around 70 factors.

00:00:21.765 --> 00:00:25.094
So, this matrix is now a 70 by 70 matrix,

00:00:25.094 --> 00:00:28.259
as opposed to the potentially several thousand by

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.220
several thousand matrix we would have had if

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:34.685
we were using a covariance matrix of the assets.

00:00:34.685 --> 00:00:38.304
There are literally just fewer elements in this matrix.

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:42.634
This means that we have reduced the number of quantities we are trying to estimate.

00:00:42.634 --> 00:00:44.804
How many fewer elements are there?

00:00:44.804 --> 00:00:46.225
Well, let's count them.

00:00:46.225 --> 00:00:49.620
Let's say the dimension of our asset covariance matrix is

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:54.189
n. Remember that covariance matrices are symmetric.

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:57.604
There are n elements on the diagonal.

00:00:57.604 --> 00:01:00.044
If we look at the remaining elements,

00:01:00.045 --> 00:01:03.719
we see we have a matrix of dimension n minus 1 by

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.194
n. But each element is in this matrix exactly twice.

00:01:08.194 --> 00:01:13.414
So, the number of unique elements is n times n minus 1 divided by 2.

00:01:13.415 --> 00:01:17.635
So, we have n elements along the diagonal and a half

00:01:17.635 --> 00:01:22.165
of n times n minus 1 number of elements that are not along the diagonal.

00:01:22.165 --> 00:01:29.890
We'll rearrange the formula a bit to get n times n plus 1 all divided by 2.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:37.660
So, in total, we have n times n plus 1 divided by 2 quantities to estimate.

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.200
Let's say n is 3,000.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.835
This is then around 4.5 million quantities.

00:01:43.834 --> 00:01:45.789
If n is instead 70,

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.260
then this is more like 2.5 thousand quantities.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.460
There's a big difference in scale there.

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:56.094
There are many fewer opportunities to introduce estimation error.

00:01:56.094 --> 00:01:59.900
The fact that we are now estimating many fewer parameters is

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.460
a good thing and an important reason why we use factor models of risk.

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:08.989
Another thing to remember is that each of the elements in this matrix is

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.500
an estimate of variance or covariance of random variables.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.134
In practice, we estimate variances and covariances using time series of data.

00:02:19.134 --> 00:02:21.179
If you have n assets,

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.890
and you want to estimate the covariance matrix of those n assets,

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:27.519
then the number of days of return that you need,

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.810
t, has to be greater than n,

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.319
and ideally much greater than n. There's more we

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.099
need to talk about to explain why the number of data points needs

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.180
to be much greater than the number of variables

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.680
n. But one problem with insufficient data is

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.409
that there won't be enough observations to accurately

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:48.495
estimate all of the variances and covariances,

00:02:48.495 --> 00:02:50.640
which means that the covariance matrix,

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:52.059
based on the sample,

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.555
would be significantly different from the population covariance matrix.

00:02:56.555 --> 00:03:00.155
Also, PCA, using such a covariance matrix,

00:03:00.155 --> 00:03:03.890
would not be able to produce meaningful principal components.

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:06.204
If you have 3,000 securities,

00:03:06.205 --> 00:03:08.550
you need at least 3,000 days of data,

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.510
which is about 12 years.

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:14.789
But we also know that variance and covariance probably change over time.

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:17.090
So, does using 12 years of data to

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.170
predict the variance for the next month even make sense?

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:21.844
Another reason people use

00:03:21.844 --> 00:03:23.900
the risk factor model formulation of

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.814
the covariance matrix is that you get around that problem.

00:03:26.814 --> 00:03:28.585
N is a smaller number,

00:03:28.585 --> 00:03:30.760
and so t can be a smaller number.
