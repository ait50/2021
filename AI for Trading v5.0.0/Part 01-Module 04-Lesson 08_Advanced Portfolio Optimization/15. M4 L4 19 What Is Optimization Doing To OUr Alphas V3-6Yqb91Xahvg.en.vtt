00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.559
Let's take a moment to have a final discussion about what is going on here.

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:06.549
We started with our alpha vector,

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:10.759
which is a vector of numbers that we think will be proportional to future returns.

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:14.070
We want to maximize our alpha times our weights and

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.190
minimize risk as modeled by our risk model,

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.710
and we use optimization to achieve this.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.510
We also apply several other constraints during optimization,

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.030
such as a constraint that we are market neutral, for example.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.410
But if we apply the market neutral constraint now,

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.814
why did we subtract the mean from each individual alpha

00:00:33.814 --> 00:00:37.695
to make them market neutral back when we were calculating our alphas?

00:00:37.695 --> 00:00:39.840
Isn't this just duplicating alpha?

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.715
Why not just wait for the optimizer to make the portfolio market neutral?

00:00:44.715 --> 00:00:48.950
We are using optimization so that we can control risk,

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.350
but it creates a challenge when the optimization

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.515
has a significant effect on the alpha vector.

00:00:54.515 --> 00:00:59.750
If your resulting portfolio is massively different than your alpha vector,

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.189
then all your research and evaluation of your alpha factors up to that point might be

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.659
invalidated if the final portfolio weights given by

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.334
the optimizer don't look anything like the original alpha factor.

00:01:13.334 --> 00:01:18.524
So, you don't want the optimization to change your alpha vector too much.

00:01:18.525 --> 00:01:21.725
If you find some alphas and the optimization yields

00:01:21.724 --> 00:01:25.149
a very different portfolio than what you had when you started,

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.425
then it's hard to figure out how to adjust the parameters.

00:01:28.424 --> 00:01:30.739
It can be hard to know whether to adjust

00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:34.655
the risk model or the constraints and by how much.

00:01:34.655 --> 00:01:39.415
Your alpha research is your pure expression of expected return.

00:01:39.415 --> 00:01:43.055
Any deviation from that is a sub-optimal deviation.

00:01:43.055 --> 00:01:47.150
But you're willing to accept that to trade off against risk,

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.344
and you're willing to change the alpha vector to optimize on risk.

00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:53.584
But that only goes so far.

00:01:53.584 --> 00:01:57.619
If you end up with a portfolio that is completely far away from the alpha vector,

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.510
then this isn't helpful either.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.370
You've evaluated the alpha factors and have some sense of how good they are,

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.754
but the portfolio may no longer be following the signals of those alpha factors.

00:02:08.754 --> 00:02:12.590
So, what that means from a practical perspective is you want to

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.700
introduce risk control as early in the process as possible.

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:21.289
If you know that you'll use your alpha in a portfolio that is sector neutral,

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:23.775
then you should make the alpha factor sector neutral.

00:02:23.775 --> 00:02:28.444
That way, if the alpha factor already looks good given the sector neutral weights,

00:02:28.444 --> 00:02:34.599
it has a better chance of translating well from theoretical alpha to resulting portfolio.
