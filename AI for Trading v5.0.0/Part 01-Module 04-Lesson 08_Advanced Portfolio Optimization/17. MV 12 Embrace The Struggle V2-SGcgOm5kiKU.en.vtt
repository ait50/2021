00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.115
You need a degree program so far.

00:00:02.115 --> 00:00:04.140
Perhaps you've had moments where you felt challenged,

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.600
or a little bit stuck with something new that you're learning.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.670
Maybe you felt frustrated in those moments.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.725
Maybe that's even happening right now.

00:00:10.725 --> 00:00:13.605
We wanted you to know that this is totally normal.

00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:16.020
All of us face different challenges when we are learning.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.330
The three of us thought that we would share some stories and

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.075
information with you about our experiences with this.

00:00:21.075 --> 00:00:23.820
I can remember struggling with trying to remember

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.370
what I had learned in a class I took years ago.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.460
I tried a few problems from the book I was studying and realized that I had

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.880
forgotten so much and felt really frustrated.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.745
I got so frustrated, had to take a break and call a friend.

00:00:35.745 --> 00:00:38.235
But there was another funny thing that happened too.

00:00:38.235 --> 00:00:41.050
More than usual, I wanted to get the problems right.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.230
It was more motivated to learn the material better in a way that would stick with me.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.800
I also had a different perspective than when I initially took the class.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.705
For my work experiences since then,

00:00:50.705 --> 00:00:54.620
I had more ideas about when and how the information would be useful.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.010
In the end, all of this made me feel good because I knew I

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.070
had some new sources of motivation to tap into.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.270
That's really interesting. It sounds like

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.340
those tricky moments in your learning ended up helping

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.920
you understand better how you learn best. What about you Eddy?

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.220
Oh me? Oh. Well. I recall when I was learning about neural networks.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.140
I realized that I didn't really

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.485
understand the math that goes into training in neural network.

00:01:18.485 --> 00:01:20.510
I got confused when I looked at the code.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.375
So I began writing out the matrices on paper.

00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:25.595
I was still confused by the math.

00:01:25.595 --> 00:01:28.950
So I started drawing circles connected by lines.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.145
The way we normally picture a neural network.

00:01:31.145 --> 00:01:31.855
Interesting.

00:01:31.855 --> 00:01:35.870
I spent over a week drawing and scribbling simple multiplications and

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.890
additions on paper until I finally reached a solution that I was expecting.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.525
Without all the math.

00:01:41.525 --> 00:01:46.145
Then I compared it to the linear algebra approach to see that they were the same.

00:01:46.145 --> 00:01:48.545
So even though I fell behind in my studies,

00:01:48.545 --> 00:01:51.860
it was worth it to me because I felt more confident in my ability to

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.805
struggle through something and to not give up when I felt completely lost.

00:01:55.805 --> 00:01:59.540
It sounds like all that time and effort that you took to address

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.205
this big question that you had really helped you to

00:02:01.205 --> 00:02:04.285
solidify your conceptual understanding of neural networks.

00:02:04.285 --> 00:02:06.560
Something that I'm hearing from both of you is that

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.870
these moments of challenge ended up really providing

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.700
you with opportunities to take ownership over

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.385
your own learning and make it more effective for you.

00:02:13.385 --> 00:02:15.530
I think that's a super important point to talk about.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.065
Because if you didn't feel challenged at some points in your learning,

00:02:18.065 --> 00:02:20.285
that would actually be a big problem.

00:02:20.285 --> 00:02:22.550
It would mean that the boundaries of your knowledge and

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.625
your skills weren't really being pushed beyond where they were right now.

00:02:25.625 --> 00:02:28.850
Really that's why we all come to learning experiences in the first place.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.750
The whole purpose of this and Energy Program is to help you students learn deeply

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.130
and be able to apply that learning in

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.130
a whole variety of different relevant situations in the future.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.195
So when we're faced with problems that build on what we've already learned,

00:02:41.195 --> 00:02:44.015
but are just outside the realm of what we know how to do.

00:02:44.015 --> 00:02:45.250
Our brain has to adapt.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.700
Find these novel solutions,

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.290
and it grows as a result.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.240
So the next time that you feel stuck or

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.930
frustrated or puzzled when you're trying to figure something out.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.430
Remember that this feeling is normal and it

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.250
doesn't say anything bad about your ability to learn the material.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.150
In those moments, take a second to remember why you're here and what

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.710
your goals are and why learning

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.740
this tricky stuff matters for what you want to do in the future.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.515
Don't be afraid to take a break if you need to.

00:03:09.515 --> 00:03:12.950
We'd also recommend that you identify what's most

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.675
challenging and give yourself the time and permission to really explore it in detail.

00:03:17.675 --> 00:03:23.300
Remember not to rush yourself because we want your learning to feel cohesive and to last.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.170
Totally. Keep giving your brain this opportunities to grow. Happy learning.
