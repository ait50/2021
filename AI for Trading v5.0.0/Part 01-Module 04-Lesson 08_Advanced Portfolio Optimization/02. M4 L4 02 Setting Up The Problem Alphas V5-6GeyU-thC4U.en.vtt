00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.815
Our goal is to set up

00:00:01.815 --> 00:00:06.804
a portfolio optimization problem using our alpha factors and risk model.

00:00:06.804 --> 00:00:10.184
In practice, it's possible that we are doing this

00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:13.350
in order to design a portfolio from scratch,

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.824
but it's also possible that we are trying to

00:00:15.824 --> 00:00:18.869
guide the evolution of an existing portfolio.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.210
So, there may already be a portfolio in production with capital invested in

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.984
a universe of assets and portfolio weights on the assets from a previous optimization,

00:00:29.984 --> 00:00:35.384
which may have evolved as the asset values appreciated or depreciated.

00:00:35.384 --> 00:00:38.399
So, how do we set up the optimization with

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.600
our new or updated alpha factors and updated data?

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.893
Thinking back to what we learned before about portfolio optimization,

00:00:46.893 --> 00:00:50.289
we know we want to do something like maximize

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:53.844
return and limit risk as measured by variance.

00:00:53.844 --> 00:00:57.909
This is already great intuition for how to set up the problem.

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:01.539
Can you guess where our alpha factors and risk model would go in

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:06.219
the problem formulation following this intuition?

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:10.239
Let's make this explicit starting with the alpha factors.

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:13.309
Let's say we have just one alpha factor,

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.189
we know that on a given day,

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:18.310
our alpha factor is a vector of values,

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:25.040
one value per stock that is hopefully predictive of the future mean return of each stock.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.410
But now we want a quantity in

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.090
the objective function that represents the predicted portfolio return.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.594
Somehow, we need to sum the alpha values over the portfolio.

00:01:36.594 --> 00:01:38.689
Can you see what we want here?

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.799
To calculate the portfolio alpha,

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.875
we just take the dot product of the alpha with a vector of portfolio weights.

00:01:46.875 --> 00:01:49.665
Let's plot this into the objective function.

00:01:49.665 --> 00:01:53.560
We make it negative because we want to maximize alpha.
