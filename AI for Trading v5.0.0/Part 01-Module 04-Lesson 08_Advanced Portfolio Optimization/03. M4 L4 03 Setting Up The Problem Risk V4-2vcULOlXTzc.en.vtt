00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.615
Okay, now where does the risk model come in?

00:00:03.615 --> 00:00:06.450
Well, we discussed previously that if we put

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.515
the quantity representing the mean in the objective,

00:00:09.515 --> 00:00:14.150
one option is to place a constraint on the portfolio variance.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.164
We already know how to calculate the portfolio covariance matrix using a risk model.

00:00:20.164 --> 00:00:23.789
All we do to get the portfolio variance is

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.454
the same thing we did back when we were calculating the portfolio variance before.

00:00:28.454 --> 00:00:31.179
We write the portfolio variance as

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:36.975
the weight vector transpose times the covariance matrix times the weight vector.

00:00:36.975 --> 00:00:40.939
That's great, so let's limit portfolio risk.

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:44.119
We'll say it has to be below some value.

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:46.744
We're already most of the way there.

00:00:46.744 --> 00:00:51.078
You might have one very reasonable question at this point which is,

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.039
how do we know what value to set as our limit on portfolio variance?

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.019
Well, this value represents the tolerable variance of

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.980
your portfolio returns per time period over which you run the optimization.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.829
As a portfolio manager,

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:08.789
this is usually given to you,

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.635
but where does it come from?

00:01:10.635 --> 00:01:13.280
Well, it represents a business decision.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.614
Remember that the investment portfolio we're designing represents a product,

00:01:17.614 --> 00:01:19.359
which is sold to investors.

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:21.290
When investors are shopping around,

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.594
they typically compare products with different risk return characteristics.

00:01:25.594 --> 00:01:27.715
What numbers are reasonable?

00:01:27.715 --> 00:01:31.850
The general stale volatility can be observed from the market itself,

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:35.354
for example, from an index like the S&amp;P 500.

00:01:35.355 --> 00:01:38.590
The annualized standard deviation of the S&amp;P

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.370
500 over 100 years has been 12 percent or so.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.445
So, people benchmark their risk against that.

00:01:45.444 --> 00:01:49.639
If you look at indices that measure hedge fund industry performance,

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.719
you see volatility of around four to five percent.

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:54.844
So, if I'm running a hedge fund,

00:01:54.844 --> 00:01:57.679
there's business risk associated with setting

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.035
my product's portfolio risk to something dramatically different from those numbers.

00:02:02.034 --> 00:02:06.140
Over time, there's been evolutionary convergence to the levels of risk,

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.370
that makes sense given the market for these products.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.469
If you work in a really big firm,

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:13.615
and you're managing a small portfolio,

00:02:13.615 --> 00:02:16.250
you will likely receive this number as a mandate,

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.884
such as you can't lose more than 10 percent.

00:02:18.884 --> 00:02:22.669
So, you can calibrate your risk so that you are comfortable with where you

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:27.359
are currently in relation to that maximum loss threshold.
