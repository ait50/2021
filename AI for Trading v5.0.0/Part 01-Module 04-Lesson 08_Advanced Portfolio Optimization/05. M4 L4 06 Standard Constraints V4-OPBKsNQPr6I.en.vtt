00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.075
But we're not quite done.

00:00:02.075 --> 00:00:06.254
As you know, we can impose lots of different constraints on the problem.

00:00:06.254 --> 00:00:07.775
These usually have to do with

00:00:07.775 --> 00:00:11.565
real-world constraints on the way we want our portfolio to behave.

00:00:11.564 --> 00:00:15.404
Sometimes they just make sure our results aren't really wacky.

00:00:15.404 --> 00:00:18.044
Let's discuss some common constraints.

00:00:18.044 --> 00:00:21.629
First off, we need to think about whether our portfolio is long

00:00:21.629 --> 00:00:25.154
only or whether we are allowed to take short positions.

00:00:25.155 --> 00:00:28.984
We'd usually know this from limitations in our trading environment.

00:00:28.984 --> 00:00:33.060
If we needed to enforce the constraint that our portfolio be long only,

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.609
we'd require that each of our portfolio weights to be positive.

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:39.545
If we can take long or short positions,

00:00:39.545 --> 00:00:41.850
we'd place no such constraint.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.630
It's very common to require that our portfolio be market neutral.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.250
What do we mean by that?

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.825
In effect, it means that across the board,

00:00:50.825 --> 00:00:53.380
we short as much capital as we long.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.625
This means that we lose as much as we gain from movements that affect the entire market.

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:02.590
In other words, when a portfolio is designed to be market neutral,

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:08.115
the portfolio's returns are hopefully less affected by movement in the entire market.

00:01:08.114 --> 00:01:13.234
We mentioned making the portfolio market neutral when we discussed alpha factors.

00:01:13.234 --> 00:01:15.730
The difference here is that we place this as

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.660
a constraint on the portfolio weights themselves,

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.795
so that the constraint will be enforced by the optimization.

00:01:22.795 --> 00:01:26.829
Hedge funds usually require that the sum of the weights be zero.

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:30.769
However, an alternative is to control the balance of long to

00:01:30.769 --> 00:01:35.679
short positions by requiring that the sum of the weights remain in some range.
