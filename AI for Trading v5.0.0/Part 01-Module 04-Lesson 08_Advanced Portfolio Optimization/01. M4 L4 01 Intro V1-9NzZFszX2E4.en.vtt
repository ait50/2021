00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.355
You have come so far.

00:00:02.355 --> 00:00:06.269
Just think of all the amazing things we've told you in the past few lessons,

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:09.445
I bet your head is spinning in a good way.

00:00:09.445 --> 00:00:11.640
We've been talking about factors,

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.750
how to think about them,

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.914
how to find them, how to code them up,

00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:16.314
how to make them robust,

00:00:16.315 --> 00:00:17.880
and how to evaluate them.

00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:22.384
We've told you about risk factors and about the fun ones, alpha factors.

00:00:22.385 --> 00:00:24.190
But in this lesson,

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.070
the rubber really hits the road.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.714
Now we want to find the optimal weights for our portfolio.

00:00:29.714 --> 00:00:33.299
So, we're going to plug our Alpha and risk factors into the formalism we

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:37.419
discussed earlier in the course for portfolio optimization.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.940
This lesson is going to be critical for finishing the project.

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:44.599
I can't wait to tell you about it, so, let's get started.
