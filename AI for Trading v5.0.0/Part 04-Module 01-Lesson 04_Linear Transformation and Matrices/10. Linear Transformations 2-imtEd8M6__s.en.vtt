00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.633
So how do you think you could describe these transformations numerically,

00:00:03.633 --> 00:00:07.804
if you're say, programming some animations to make a video teaching the topic?

00:00:07.804 --> 00:00:09.785
What formula do you give the computer,

00:00:09.785 --> 00:00:12.074
so that if you give it the coordinates of a vector,

00:00:12.074 --> 00:00:15.814
it can give you the coordinates of where that vector lands?

00:00:15.814 --> 00:00:20.259
It turns out that you only need to record where the two bases vectors,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.725
i hat and j hat,

00:00:21.725 --> 00:00:24.900
each land, and everything else will follow from that.

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:29.509
For example, consider the vector V with coordinates negative one, two.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.170
Meaning that it equals negative one times i hat,

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.579
plus two times j hat.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.995
If we play some transformation and follow where all three of these vectors go,

00:00:40.994 --> 00:00:43.564
the property that grid lines remain parallel and

00:00:43.564 --> 00:00:46.679
evenly spaced has a really important consequence.

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:50.865
The place where V lands, will be negative one times the vector where i hat landed,

00:00:50.865 --> 00:00:53.664
plus two times the vector where j hat landed.

00:00:53.664 --> 00:00:58.185
In other words, it started off as a certain linear combination of i hat and j hat,

00:00:58.185 --> 00:01:03.020
and it ends up as that same linear combination of where those two vectors landed.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:09.185
This means you can deduce where V must go based only on where i hat and j hat each land.

00:01:09.185 --> 00:01:12.790
This is why I like keeping a copy of the original grid in the background.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.655
For the transformations shown here,

00:01:14.655 --> 00:01:19.109
we can read off that i hat lands on the coordinates one, negative two.

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:23.334
And j hat lands on the x axis over at the coordinates three, zero.

00:01:23.334 --> 00:01:28.030
This means that the vector represented by negative one i hat plus two times j hat,

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.719
ends up at negative one times the vector one negative two,

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:34.560
plus two times the vector three, zero.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.579
Adding that all together you can deduce that it has to land on the vector five, two.

00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:45.794
This is a good point to pause and ponder because it's pretty important.

00:01:45.795 --> 00:01:49.780
Now, given that I'm actually showing you the full transformation,

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.474
you could have just looked to see that V has the coordinates five, two.

00:01:53.474 --> 00:01:55.969
But the cool part here is that this gives us

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:58.780
a technique to deduce where any vectors land,

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.960
so long as we have a record of where i hat and j hat

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:05.859
each land without needing to watch the transformation itself.

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:09.300
Write the vector with more general coordinates x and y,

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.945
and it will land on x times the vector where i hat lands,

00:02:12.944 --> 00:02:19.155
one negative two, plus y times the vector where j hat lands, three, zero.

00:02:19.155 --> 00:02:21.224
Carrying out that sum,

00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:24.159
you see that it lands at one x plus three y,

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:27.384
negative two x plus zero y. I give you

00:02:27.384 --> 00:02:32.125
any vector and you can tell me where that vector lands using this formula.

00:02:32.125 --> 00:02:34.560
What all of this is saying is that

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.939
a two dimensional linear transformation is completely described by just four numbers,

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.159
the two coordinates for where i hat lands

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.719
and the two coordinates for where j hat lands.

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:48.240
Isn't that cool? It's common to package these coordinates into

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.840
a two by two grid of numbers called a two by two matrix.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.060
Where you can interpret the columns as

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.974
the two special vectors where i hat and j hat each land.

00:02:57.974 --> 00:03:02.180
If you're given the two by two matrix describing a linear transformation and

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.485
some specific vector and you want to know

00:03:04.485 --> 00:03:07.955
where that linear transformation takes that vector,

00:03:07.955 --> 00:03:10.205
you can take the coordinates of the vector,

00:03:10.205 --> 00:03:13.715
multiply them by the corresponding columns of the matrix,

00:03:13.715 --> 00:03:15.615
then add together what you get.

00:03:15.615 --> 00:03:21.280
This corresponds with the idea of adding the scaled versions of our new basis vectors.
