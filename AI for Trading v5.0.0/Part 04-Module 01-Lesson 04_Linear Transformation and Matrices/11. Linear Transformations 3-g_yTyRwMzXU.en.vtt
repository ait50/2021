00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.100
Let's see what this looks like in the most general case,

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.730
where your matrix has entries a, b, c,

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.370
d. And remember, this matrix is just a way of

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:12.019
packaging the information needed to describe a linear transformation.

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.339
Always remember to interpret that first column, a, c,

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:18.940
as the place where the first basis vector lands and that second column,

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.530
b,d, as the place where the second basis vector lands.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.289
When we apply this transformation to some vector x,

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.059
y, what do you get?

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:29.769
Well, it will be x times a,

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:32.269
c, plus, y times b,

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.740
d. Putting this together,

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.570
you get a vector ax + by, cx + dy.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.490
You could even define this as

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.900
matrix vector multiplication when you put

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:46.780
the matrix on the left of the vector like it's a function.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.620
Then you could make high schoolers memorize this without

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:53.054
showing them the crucial part that makes it feel intuitive.

00:00:53.054 --> 00:00:55.500
But isn't it more fun to think about

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.109
these columns as the transformed versions of your basis vectors,

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:04.579
and to think about the results as the appropriate linear combination of those vectors?

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.750
Let's practice describing a few linear transformations with matrices.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.629
For example, if we rotate all of space 90 degrees counter-clockwise,

00:01:14.629 --> 00:01:17.420
then i_hat lands on the coordinates (0,

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.170
1,) and j_hat lands on the coordinates (-1, 0).

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.170
So the matrix we end up with has columns (0, 1) (-1,

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.165
0) to figure out what happens to any vector after a 90 degree rotation.

00:01:32.165 --> 00:01:36.145
You could just multiply its coordinates by this matrix.

00:01:36.144 --> 00:01:40.204
Here's a fun transformation with a special name called a shear.

00:01:40.204 --> 00:01:42.510
In it, i_hat remains fixed.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.370
So, the first column of The Matrix is 1,

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.070
0 but j_hat moves over to the coordinates (1,

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:51.324
1) which become the second column of The Matrix.

00:01:51.325 --> 00:01:53.340
And at the risk of being redundant here,

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.310
figuring out how a shear transforms a given vector

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.500
comes down to multiplying this matrix by that vector.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.030
Let's say we want to go the other way around.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.310
Starting with a matrix,

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.620
say with columns 1,

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.250
2 and 3, 1,

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.129
and we want to deduce what its transformation looks like.

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.319
Pause and take a moment to see if you can imagine it.

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.400
One way to do this is to first move i_hat to 1,

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.724
2, then move j_hat to 3, 1.

00:02:20.724 --> 00:02:23.189
Always moving the rest of space in such a way that

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:26.655
keeps grid lines parallel and evenly spaced.

00:02:26.655 --> 00:02:31.344
If the vectors that i_hat and j_hat land on are linearly dependent,

00:02:31.344 --> 00:02:36.020
which if you recall from last video means that one is a scaled version of the other,

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.409
it means that the linear transformation squishes all of

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.889
2D space onto the line where those two vectors sit,

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:49.039
also known as the one dimensional span of those two linearly dependent vectors.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.810
To sum up, linear transformations are a way to move around

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.515
space such that grid lines remain parallel and evenly spaced,

00:02:57.514 --> 00:02:59.709
and such that the origin remains fixed.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.395
Delightfully, these transformations can be described using only a handful of numbers,

00:03:04.395 --> 00:03:07.855
the coordinates of where each basis vector lands.

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:13.399
Matrices give us a language to describe these transformations where the columns represent

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.580
those coordinates and matrix vector multiplication is

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.535
just a way to compute what that transformation does to a given vector.

00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:23.530
The important takeaway here is that every time you see

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.800
a matrix you can interpret it as a certain transformation of space.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.880
Once you really digest this idea,

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:33.120
you're in a great position to understand linear algebra deeply.
