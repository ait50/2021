00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.269
Hey everyone, if I had to choose just one topic that makes all of the others in

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:18.660
linear algebra start to click and which too often

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.179
goes unlearned the first time a student takes linear algebra,

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:22.454
it will be this one.

00:00:22.454 --> 00:00:24.859
The idea of a linear transformation,

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:26.774
and its relation to matrices.

00:00:26.774 --> 00:00:29.079
For this video, I'm just going to focus on what

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.179
these transformations look like in the case of two dimensions,

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:35.524
and how they relate to the idea of matrix-vector multiplication.

00:00:35.524 --> 00:00:40.140
In particular, I want to show you a way to think about matrix-vector multiplication,

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.649
that doesn't rely on memorization.

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.994
To start, let's just parse this term, linear transformation.

00:00:46.994 --> 00:00:50.179
Transformation is essentially a fancy word for function,

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:52.020
it's something that takes in inputs,

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.660
and spits out an output for each one Specifically in the context of linear algebra,

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:59.719
we like to think about transformations that take in some vector,

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:01.799
and spit out another vector.

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:05.209
So, why use the word transformation instead of function,

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:06.729
if they mean the same thing?

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.725
Well, it's to be suggestive of a certain way to visualize this input-output relation.

00:01:11.724 --> 00:01:14.619
A great way to understand functions of vectors,

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.448
is to use movement.

00:01:16.448 --> 00:01:19.310
If a transformation takes some input vector,

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.875
to some output vector,

00:01:20.875 --> 00:01:25.295
we imagine that input vector moving over to the output vector.

00:01:25.295 --> 00:01:28.150
Then to understand the transformation as a whole,

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.385
we might imagine watching every possible input vector,

00:01:31.385 --> 00:01:34.605
move over to its corresponding output vector.

00:01:34.605 --> 00:01:37.424
It gets really crowded to think about all of the vectors,

00:01:37.424 --> 00:01:39.334
all at once, each one has an arrow.

00:01:39.334 --> 00:01:40.994
So, as I mentioned in the last video,

00:01:40.995 --> 00:01:44.625
a nice trick is to conceptualize each vector not as an arrow,

00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:45.959
but as a single point.

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:48.569
The point where it's tip sets That way,

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:53.129
to think about a transformation taking every possible input vector to some output vector,

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:56.844
we watch every point in space moving to some other point.

00:01:56.844 --> 00:01:59.459
In the case of transformations in two dimensions,

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:02.829
to get a better feel for the whole shape of the transformation,

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:06.194
I like to do this with all of the points on an infinite grid.

00:02:06.194 --> 00:02:09.354
I also sometimes like to keep a copy of the grid in the background,

00:02:09.354 --> 00:02:11.584
just to help keep track of where everything ends up,

00:02:11.585 --> 00:02:13.900
relative to where it starts.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.320
The effect for various transformations moving around all of the points in space is,

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.534
and you've got to admit, beautiful.

00:02:21.534 --> 00:02:23.219
It gives the feeling of squishing,

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:25.169
and morphing space itself.

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:30.229
As you can imagine though arbitrary transformations can look pretty complicated.

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:34.479
But luckily, linear algebra limits itself to a special type of transformation.

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:38.764
Ones that are easier to understand, called linear transformations.

00:02:38.764 --> 00:02:43.414
Visually speaking, a transformation is linear if it has two properties.

00:02:43.414 --> 00:02:47.194
All lines must remain lines without getting curved,

00:02:47.194 --> 00:02:50.180
and the origin must remain fixed in place.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.030
For example, this right here would not be a linear transformation,

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.844
since the lines get all curvy.

00:02:55.844 --> 00:02:58.745
And this one right here although it keeps the line straight,

00:02:58.745 --> 00:03:00.590
is not a linear transformation,

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.295
because it moves the origin.

00:03:02.294 --> 00:03:04.179
This one here fixes the origin,

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.990
and it might look like it keeps lines straight,

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.240
but that's just because I'm only showing the horizontal,

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.430
and vertical grid lines.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.340
When you see what it does to a diagonal line,

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.479
it becomes clear that it's not at all linear,

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:16.079
since it turns that line all curvy.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.450
In general, you should think of linear transformations as

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:22.899
keeping grid lines parallel, and evenly spaced.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.750
Some linear transformations are simple to think about,

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.854
like rotations about the origin.

00:03:27.854 --> 00:03:31.119
Others are a little trickier to describe with words.
