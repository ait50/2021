00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.190
This is a good time to talk about how people commonly think about vectors as points.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.385
It gets really crowded to think about a whole collection of vectors, sitting on a line.

00:00:08.384 --> 00:00:09.689
And more crowded still,

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:13.474
to think about all two-dimensional vectors all at once filling up the plane.

00:00:13.474 --> 00:00:16.280
So when dealing with collections of vectors like this,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.170
it is common to represent each one with just a point in space.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.105
The point at the tip of that vector,

00:00:22.105 --> 00:00:26.750
where as usual, I want you thinking about that vector with its tail on the origin.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.000
That way, if you want to think about

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.949
every possible vector whose tip sits on a certain line,

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.950
just think about the line itself.

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:40.549
Likewise, to think about all possible two-dimensional vectors all at once,

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:44.140
conceptualize each one as the point where its tip sits.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.520
So, in effect what you will be thinking about is

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.484
the infinite flat sheet of two-dimensional space itself,

00:00:49.484 --> 00:00:51.755
leaving the arrows out of it.

00:00:51.755 --> 00:00:56.655
In general, if you are thinking about a vector on its own, think of it as an arrow.

00:00:56.655 --> 00:00:59.039
And if you are dealing with a collection of vectors,

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.464
it's convenient to think of them all as points.

00:01:01.465 --> 00:01:03.295
So, for our span example,

00:01:03.295 --> 00:01:05.939
the span of most pairs of vectors ends up being

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.670
the entire infinite sheet of two-dimensional space.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.469
But if they line up, their span is just a line.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.400
The idea of span gets a lot more interesting if we

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.260
start thinking about vectors in three-dimensional space.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.704
For example, if you take two vectors in 3D space,

00:01:23.704 --> 00:01:25.599
that are not pointing in the same direction.

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:28.449
What does it mean to take their span?

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.125
Well, their span is the collection of all possible linear combinations,

00:01:34.125 --> 00:01:35.480
of those two vectors.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.160
Meaning all possible vectors you get by

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.109
scaling each of the two of them in some way and then adding them together.

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:45.209
You can kind of imagine turning two different knobs to

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:48.424
change the two scalars defining the linear combination,

00:01:48.424 --> 00:01:52.185
adding the scaled vectors and following the tip of the resulting vector.

00:01:52.185 --> 00:01:54.460
That tip will trace out some kind of

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:58.109
flat sheet cutting through the origin of three-dimensional space.

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:02.825
This flat sheet is the span of the two vectors, or more precisely,

00:02:02.825 --> 00:02:05.260
the set of all possible vectors whose tips sit

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.185
on that flat sheet is the span of your two vectors.

00:02:08.185 --> 00:02:10.729
Isn't that a beautiful mental image?

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.639
So, what happens if we add a third vector

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:16.674
and consider the span of all three of those guys?

00:02:16.675 --> 00:02:19.350
A linear combination of three vectors is

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.784
defined pretty much the same way as it is for two.

00:02:21.784 --> 00:02:23.634
You'll choose three different scalars,

00:02:23.634 --> 00:02:27.979
scale each of those vectors and then add them all together.

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:38.679
And again, the span of these vectors is the set of all possible linear combinations.

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:42.704
Two different things could happen here.

00:02:42.705 --> 00:02:46.805
If your third vector happens to be sitting on the span of the first two,

00:02:46.805 --> 00:02:48.314
then the span doesn't change.

00:02:48.314 --> 00:02:50.849
You're sort of trapped, on that same flat sheet.

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.039
In other words, adding a scaled version of that third vector to

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:58.614
the linear combination doesn't really give you access to any new vectors.

00:02:58.615 --> 00:03:01.550
But if you just randomly choose a third vector,

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.995
it's almost certainly not sitting on the span of those first two.

00:03:04.995 --> 00:03:07.575
Then, since it is pointing in a separate direction,

00:03:07.574 --> 00:03:11.524
it unlocks access to every possible three-dimensional vector.

00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:13.560
One way I like to think about this,

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.120
is that as you scale that new third vector,

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.849
it moves around that span sheet of the first two sweeping it through all of space.

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:23.539
Another way to think about it,

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:27.120
is that you are making full use of the three freely changing scalars that you

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.759
have at your disposal to access the full three dimensions of space.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.539
Now, in the case where the third vector was already sitting on

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:40.014
the span of the first two or the case where two vectors happen to line up,

00:03:40.014 --> 00:03:42.184
we want some terminology to describe the fact

00:03:42.185 --> 00:03:44.670
that at least one of these vectors is redundant.

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:46.859
Not adding anything to our span.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.950
Whenever this happens, where you have

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:52.229
multiple vectors and you could remove one without reducing the span,

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:56.574
the relevant terminology is to say that they are linearly dependent.

00:03:56.574 --> 00:03:59.269
Another way of phrasing that would be to say that one of

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.880
the vectors can be expressed as a linear combination of the others,

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.240
since it is already in the span of the others.

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.769
On the other hand, if each vector really does add another dimension to the span,

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.250
they are said to be linearly independent.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.949
So with all of that terminology and hopefully with some good mental images to go with it,

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:29.089
let me leave you with a puzzle before we go.

00:04:29.089 --> 00:04:32.579
The technical definition of a basis of a space is

00:04:32.579 --> 00:04:37.714
a set of linearly independent vectors that span that space.

00:04:37.714 --> 00:04:41.759
Now given how I described a basis earlier and given

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:45.339
your current understanding of the words span and linearly independent,

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:49.349
think about why this definition would make sense.

00:04:49.769 --> 00:04:55.579
In the next video, I will get into matrices and transforming space. See you then.
