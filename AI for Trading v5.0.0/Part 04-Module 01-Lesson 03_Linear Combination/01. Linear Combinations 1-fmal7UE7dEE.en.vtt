00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:16.059
In the last video, along with the ideas of vector addition and scalar multiplication,

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.984
I described vector coordinates,

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:19.829
where there's this back and forth between,

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:23.359
for example, pairs of numbers and two-dimensional vectors.

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.234
Now, I imagined the vector coordinates were already familiar to a lot of you,

00:00:27.234 --> 00:00:30.375
but there's another kind of interesting way to think about these coordinates,

00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:32.454
which is pretty central to linear algebra.

00:00:32.454 --> 00:00:35.405
When you have a pair of numbers that's meant to describe a vector,

00:00:35.405 --> 00:00:37.370
like three negative two,

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:40.500
I want you to think about each coordinate as a scalar.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.810
Meaning, think about how each one stretches or squishes vectors.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.725
In the x, y coordinate system,

00:00:46.725 --> 00:00:48.745
there are two very special vectors,

00:00:48.744 --> 00:00:51.004
the one pointing to the right with length one,

00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:54.710
commonly called i hat or the unit vector in the x-direction,

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.310
and the one pointing straight up with length one,

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.795
commonly called j hat or the univector in the y-direction.

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:06.784
Now, think of the x-coordinate of our vector as a scalar that scales i hat,

00:01:06.784 --> 00:01:12.004
stretching it by a factor of three and the y-coordinate as a scalar that scales j hat,

00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:14.584
flipping it and stretching it by a factor of two.

00:01:14.584 --> 00:01:17.299
In this sense, the vector that these coordinates

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.730
describe is the sum of two scaled vectors.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.770
That's a surprisingly important concept,

00:01:22.769 --> 00:01:26.454
this idea of adding together two scaled vectors.

00:01:26.454 --> 00:01:29.170
Those two vectors, i hat and j hat,

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.644
have a special name by the way.

00:01:30.644 --> 00:01:33.905
Together, they're called the basis of a coordinate system.

00:01:33.905 --> 00:01:38.000
What this means basically is that when you think about coordinates as scalars,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.060
the basis vectors are what those scalars actually scale.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.344
There's also a more technical definition,

00:01:44.344 --> 00:01:46.579
but I'll get to that later.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.585
By framing our coordinate system in terms of these two special basis vectors,

00:01:51.584 --> 00:01:54.149
it raises a pretty interesting and subtle point.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.460
We could have chosen different basis vectors and gotten

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:00.829
a completely reasonable new coordinate system.

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.409
For example, take some vector pointing up and to

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.254
the right along with some other vector pointing down and to the right in some way.

00:02:07.254 --> 00:02:09.930
Take a moment to think about all the different vectors that

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.640
you can get by choosing two scalars,

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:15.424
using each one to scale one of the vectors,

00:02:15.425 --> 00:02:17.450
then adding together what you get.

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:22.549
Which two-dimensional vectors can you reach by altering the choices of scalars?

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.295
The answer is that you can reach every possible two-dimensional vector.

00:02:28.294 --> 00:02:31.399
And I think it's a good puzzle to contemplate why.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.860
A new pair of bases vectors like this still gives us a valid way to

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.630
go back and forth between pairs of numbers and two-dimensional vectors,

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.710
but the association is definitely different from the one that you

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.030
get using the more standard basis of i hat and j hat.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.759
That anytime we described vectors numerically,

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:52.834
it depends on an implicit choice of what basis vectors we're using.

00:02:52.835 --> 00:02:56.534
So, anytime that you're scaling two vectors and adding them like this,

00:02:56.534 --> 00:03:00.710
it's called a linear combination of those two vectors.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.640
Where does this word linear come from?

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:05.579
Why does this have anything to do with lines?

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.155
Well, this isn't the etymology,

00:03:07.155 --> 00:03:10.000
but one way I like to think about it is that if you fix one

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.125
of those scalars and let the other one change its value freely,

00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:17.490
the tip of the resulting vector draws a straight line.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.760
Now, if you let both scalars range

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:24.995
freely and consider every possible vector that you can get,

00:03:24.995 --> 00:03:26.860
there are two things that can happen.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.555
For most pairs of vectors,

00:03:28.555 --> 00:03:31.254
you'll be able to reach every possible point in the plane.

00:03:31.254 --> 00:03:34.144
Every two-dimensional vector is within your grasp.

00:03:34.145 --> 00:03:38.330
However, in the unlucky case where your two original vectors happen to line up,

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.820
the tip of the resulting vector is limited

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.094
to just the single line passing through the origin.

00:03:44.094 --> 00:03:47.189
Actually, technically, there's a third possibility too,

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:51.710
both your vectors could be zero in which case you'd just be stuck at the origin.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.590
Here's some more terminology.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.840
The set of all possible vectors that you can reach with a linear combination of

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.879
a given pair of vectors is called the span of those two vectors.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.765
So, restating what we just saw in this lingo,

00:04:07.764 --> 00:04:11.934
the span of most pairs of 2D vectors is all vectors of 2D space.

00:04:11.935 --> 00:04:17.350
But when they line up, their span is all vectors whose tip sits on a certain line.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.805
Remember how I said that linear algebra

00:04:19.805 --> 00:04:22.800
revolves around vector addition and scalar multiplication?

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.980
Well, the span of two vectors is basically a way of asking what are

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.555
all the possible vectors you can reach using only these two fundamental operations,

00:04:31.555 --> 00:04:34.439
vector addition and scalar multiplication?
