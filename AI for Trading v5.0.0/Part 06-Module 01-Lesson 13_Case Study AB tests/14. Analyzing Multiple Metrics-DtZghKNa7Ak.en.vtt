00:00:02.299 --> 00:00:05.099
As you've seen in previous lessons,

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:06.839
the more things that you test,

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.594
the more likely you are to observe significant differences just by chance.

00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:15.990
This happens when we run evaluations from multiple metrics at the same time.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.594
The probability of any false positive increases as you increase the number of metrics.

00:00:21.594 --> 00:00:24.000
Luckily, this is something that we can fix.
