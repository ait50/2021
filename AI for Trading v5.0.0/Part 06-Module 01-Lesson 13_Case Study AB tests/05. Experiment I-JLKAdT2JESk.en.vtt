00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:06.410
The first change Audacity wants to try is on their home page.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:07.884
They hope that this new,

00:00:07.884 --> 00:00:12.684
more engaging design will increase the number of users that explore their courses.

00:00:12.685 --> 00:00:15.870
That is, move on to the second stage of the funnel.

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:18.109
Now that we know the change we want to make,

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:20.905
we need to choose a metric that measures that change.

00:00:20.905 --> 00:00:24.000
To measure how many people move on to the next stage,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.809
we can track how many people click on

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:30.784
the Explore Courses button on the home page with the new design and the old design.

00:00:30.785 --> 00:00:34.479
However, using just the number of users doesn't make

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:39.509
sense if more total users view the page in one version of the experiment.

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:42.504
More total clicks could occur in one version

00:00:42.505 --> 00:00:46.900
even if there is a greater percentage of clicks in the other version.

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:51.534
So instead, we could use the fraction of page visitors who clicked.

00:00:51.534 --> 00:00:53.979
That is the number of clicks on

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:59.049
The View Courses button divided by the number of page views to the home page.

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:03.339
This metric is commonly called click-through rate or CTR.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.670
You could take this metric one step further and make it

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.299
the number of unique visitors who clicked at least once,

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.519
divided by the number of unique visitors to view the page.

00:01:14.519 --> 00:01:15.994
Now that we have our metric,

00:01:15.995 --> 00:01:18.825
let's set up our known alternative hypothesis.

00:01:18.825 --> 00:01:22.750
Our alternative hypothesis is what we want to prove to be true.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.930
In this case, the new home page design has

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.500
a higher click-through rate than the old home page design.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.734
And the new hypothesis is what we assumed to be true before analyzing any data,

00:01:34.734 --> 00:01:38.560
which is that the new home page design has a click-through rate that is

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.010
less than or equal to that of our old home page design.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.440
As you've seen before,

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.289
we can rearrange our hypothesis to look like this.
