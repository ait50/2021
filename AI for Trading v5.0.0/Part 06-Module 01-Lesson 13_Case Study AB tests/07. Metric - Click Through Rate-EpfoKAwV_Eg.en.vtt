00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
As you saw in the last section,

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.855
this dataset includes view and click actions on the home page of Audacity's site,

00:00:06.855 --> 00:00:11.905
from users that were shown the control and experimental versions of the A/B test.

00:00:11.904 --> 00:00:14.879
Our task is to analyze these actions to see if there

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.285
was a significant difference in performance for the two versions.

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:22.260
To do this, let's first compute the click-through rate for each group.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.090
Let's start with the control group.

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:28.800
We can extract all the actions from the control group like this.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.730
Now, to compute the click-through rate,

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.700
we'll divide the number of unique users who actually click

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.609
the Explore courses button by the total number of unique users who viewed the page.

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:42.255
This gives us a click-through rate of about 28 percent.

00:00:42.255 --> 00:00:44.935
Let's do the same thing for the experiment group.

00:00:44.935 --> 00:00:47.775
Again, we'll take all the click actions,

00:00:47.774 --> 00:00:49.515
get the unique number of users,

00:00:49.515 --> 00:00:54.755
and divide that number by the number of unique users who viewed the page.

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:58.615
That gives us a click-through rate of about 31 percent.

00:00:58.615 --> 00:01:01.429
So in this sample, the experiment group's click-through rate was

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:05.545
higher than the control group's click-through rate by about 3 percent.

00:01:05.545 --> 00:01:08.105
Now that we know the observed difference in this sample,

00:01:08.105 --> 00:01:11.960
we have to see if this difference is significant and not just due to chance.

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:14.059
Let's bootstrap the sample to simulate

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.180
the sampling distribution for the difference in proportions.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.490
Let's take a look at our sampling distribution.

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:22.439
If you remember from the previous lesson,

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.170
we can compute the p-value for our statistic which is

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.170
the observed difference in proportions by simulating

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.350
the distribution under the null hypothesis and then

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:35.054
finding the probability that our statistic came from this distribution.

00:01:35.055 --> 00:01:36.645
To simulate from the null,

00:01:36.644 --> 00:01:39.344
we'll create a normal distribution centered at zero,

00:01:39.344 --> 00:01:44.530
with the same standard deviation as our sampling distribution we simulated here.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.105
We could see the null distribution here.

00:01:47.105 --> 00:01:51.055
And this is where our observed statistic falls.

00:01:51.055 --> 00:01:54.660
We can't find the p-value like this as these are

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.015
all the null values that are more extreme than our statistic in favor of our alternative.

00:02:00.015 --> 00:02:03.530
With a p-value of approximately a half of percent,

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.849
the difference in click-through rates for the control and

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:08.754
experiment groups does appear to be significant.

00:02:08.754 --> 00:02:10.680
We can reject the null hypothesis,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.105
and based on these results,

00:02:12.104 --> 00:02:16.000
it looks like Audacity should launch the new version of the home page.
