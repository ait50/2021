00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.685
In addition to computing the enrollment rate,

00:00:02.685 --> 00:00:06.790
we can also compute the average reading durations with this dataset.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.157
The two analyses so far were comparing proportions.

00:00:10.157 --> 00:00:14.039
With this metric, we'll be analyzing the difference in means.

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:16.454
This analysis will be quite similar.

00:00:16.454 --> 00:00:18.910
Since we're comparing reading durations,

00:00:18.911 --> 00:00:21.304
we only care about view action.

00:00:21.304 --> 00:00:23.609
So let's filter by that first.

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.019
And let's only count each unique user once by finding

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.465
their average reading duration if they visited the site more than once.

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:34.230
Well, also group by group,

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:38.004
just so we keep track of that information.

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:40.920
This isn't necessary, but resetting the index is

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.899
nice just so we keep the ID and group as column names.

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:51.320
And it also let's us continue working in a data frame instead of a multi index series.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.750
Now, we can find the average reading durations for each group like this.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.390
On average, it looks like users in the experiment group spent

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.444
15 more seconds on the course overview page than those in the control group.

00:01:05.444 --> 00:01:07.994
To see if this difference is significant,

00:01:07.995 --> 00:01:10.140
let's simulate the sampling distribution for

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.299
the difference in mean reading durations with bootstrapping.

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.230
Here's what the sampling distribution looks like.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.100
Now to find the P value,

00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:23.069
let's simulate the distribution under the null and find

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:26.619
the probability that our observed statistic came from this distribution.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.335
We'll create the distribution centered at zero

00:01:29.334 --> 00:01:33.634
and they're having the same spread as our sampling distribution.

00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:36.630
Here's our null distribution.

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:40.179
And here is where I observed statistic falls.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.985
Our statistic definitely doesn't look like it came from this null distribution.

00:01:43.984 --> 00:01:47.000
Looks like the difference we observed is significant.
