00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:12.720
defining metrics that measure changes in your experiments,

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.050
analyzing results with confidence intervals and hypothesis testing,

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:21.420
handling multiple metrics, and common difficulties associated with AB testing.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.120
