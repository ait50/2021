00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:07.634
The second change Audacity wants to try is on their course overview page.

00:00:07.634 --> 00:00:11.390
They created a new description for one of their courses to dedicate

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.574
larger portions to connecting concepts in the course to career skills,

00:00:15.574 --> 00:00:18.765
and less on the details of each concept.

00:00:18.765 --> 00:00:22.894
They hope that this change may encourage more users to complete the course.

00:00:22.894 --> 00:00:26.954
For this experiment, instead of choosing just a single metric,

00:00:26.954 --> 00:00:29.029
we're going to analyze multiple.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.855
We'll track the enrollment rate,

00:00:30.855 --> 00:00:32.975
the average reading time on the course page,

00:00:32.975 --> 00:00:35.195
the average time spent in the classroom,

00:00:35.195 --> 00:00:37.115
and the course completion rate.

00:00:37.115 --> 00:00:40.700
First, we'll analyze these individually and then,

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.410
we'll see how they all come together.
