00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:06.950
When companies want to test new features or versions of a web page,

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.980
they often use a method called A/B testing.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.695
The way this works is that one set of users

00:00:12.695 --> 00:00:15.530
called the control group is shown the old version

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:18.320
of a page while another set of users called the

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.469
experiment group is shown the new version of a page.

00:00:21.469 --> 00:00:24.079
Based on how both groups respond,

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:28.039
we can determine if the new version is better and should be launched.

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.289
This is actually just an application of

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.469
hypothesis testing where the null hypothesis would

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:35.929
be that the new version is no better or

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:38.990
even worse than the old version and the alternative,

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.780
would be that the new version is better than the old version.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.730
A ton of companies use A/B testing to try out changes in features,

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:52.484
layouts and even colors to increase a metric that measures interest from their users.

00:00:52.484 --> 00:00:56.390
For example, you could perform an A/B test to see if a new look for

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.490
your site's landing page increases

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.760
the likelihood of a visit or subscribing to your mailing list.

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:04.894
Or you could perform an A/B test to see if offering

00:01:04.894 --> 00:01:09.634
personalized recommendations on a shopping site increases purchases.

00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:13.520
One thing to be aware of is that although A/B testing can be good to

00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:18.289
test if a new feature or version of a feature is better on a page,

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.945
it's not useful for everything.

00:01:20.944 --> 00:01:26.404
For example, A/B testing can tell you the best way to rank a set of products on a site

00:01:26.405 --> 00:01:28.760
but it can't tell you that the site would really

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.045
benefit from having two additional products added to the site.

00:01:33.045 --> 00:01:36.560
It's also not always great for testing whole new experiences for

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.710
existing users due to factors like change aversion and novelty effect.

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:45.679
Existing users may give an unfair advantage to the older version

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.340
simply because they're unhappy with a change even if it's ultimately for the better.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.340
Alternatively, they may give an unfair advantage to the new version

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.689
because they're excited or drawn to the change even if it isn't for the better.

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:01.984
In addition to these,

00:02:01.984 --> 00:02:06.390
there are many other factors that can bias the results of an A/B test.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.000
You'll learn more about those in this lesson.
