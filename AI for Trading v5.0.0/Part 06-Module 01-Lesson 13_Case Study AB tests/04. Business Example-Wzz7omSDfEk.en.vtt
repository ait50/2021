00:00:02.439 --> 00:00:04.564
In this case study,

00:00:04.565 --> 00:00:10.089
you'll be analyzing AB test results for an online education company called Audacity,

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:13.804
that offers courses on finance.

00:00:13.804 --> 00:00:18.379
Let's first see what a typical user flow might look like on Audacity site.

00:00:18.379 --> 00:00:21.122
New users would land on the home page,

00:00:21.123 --> 00:00:22.640
and if they're interested,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.859
they would click to explore courses.

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:26.960
As they browse the course list,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.505
a course may catch their eye,

00:00:28.504 --> 00:00:30.804
and they click on it to learn more.

00:00:30.804 --> 00:00:32.899
Once they're on the course overview page,

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:34.814
they may decide to enroll.

00:00:34.814 --> 00:00:37.835
After enrolling, they'd hopefully complete the course.

00:00:37.835 --> 00:00:40.995
In this flow, commonly called the customer funnel,

00:00:40.994 --> 00:00:44.824
users lose interest, and leave at different stages of the funnel,

00:00:44.825 --> 00:00:46.800
and few make it to the end.

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:48.904
Of course, this is a simplistic model,

00:00:48.905 --> 00:00:51.825
and isn't how all user experiences would play out.

00:00:51.825 --> 00:00:54.620
But it does capture pretty well the main steps from

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:59.299
an initial exposure to course completion in order of decreasing probability.

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:01.609
To increase student engagement,

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:05.224
Audacity wants to perform AB tests to try out changes,

00:01:05.224 --> 00:01:07.459
at different points in this funnel.

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:08.684
In this case study,

00:01:08.685 --> 00:01:12.605
we'll analyze test results for two particular changes they have in mind,

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:16.490
and then make a recommendation on whether they should launch each change.
