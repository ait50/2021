00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.470
How do we make a recommendation when three out of

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.044
our four metrics had a significant difference for testing each metric individually,

00:00:08.044 --> 00:00:11.914
but insignificant differences when we use the Bonferroni correction?

00:00:11.914 --> 00:00:14.819
The Bonferroni method is a conservative one,

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.846
and since we expect the metrics to be correlated,

00:00:17.846 --> 00:00:19.129
this would be best handled by

00:00:19.129 --> 00:00:23.464
a more sophisticated method that ideally takes this correlation into account.

00:00:23.464 --> 00:00:24.897
In the instructor notes,

00:00:24.897 --> 00:00:28.684
there is a list of possible other methods that are less conservative.

00:00:28.684 --> 00:00:31.049
Should you choose one of these methods,

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.810
you should ensure that the assumptions of the method are truly met in your scenario.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.060
Choosing a poorly suited test that simply provides the results that you want is

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.060
not only bad practice but will likely lead to

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.000
misguided decisions that harm your company's performance in the long run.
