00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.500
Because the need to maintain cash tends to erode the total return of the open-end fund,

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.425
the financial services industry created closed-end funds to address this issue.

00:00:12.425 --> 00:00:18.390
Closed-end mutual funds are closed ended because they accept investor money when

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.449
the fund is initially created and don't create

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.035
new shares or handled withdrawals afterwards.

00:00:25.035 --> 00:00:27.740
By making the fund closed ended,

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:32.149
the portfolio managers no longer have to keep cash on hand and no

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:37.149
longer have to liquidate existing positions to satisfy redemption requests.

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.039
This also means that money managers can

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:43.159
use all of the cash towards their investment strategies,

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:46.759
potentially improving the overall return of the fund.

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:49.939
So, what do investors do if they wish to

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:53.599
stop investing in the fund and get their cash back?

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.670
Investors can sell their shares to other investors.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.070
For investors, shares of closed-end funds can be

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.260
bought and sold on the stock exchange just like a stock.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.344
This means that investors do not need to wait

00:01:08.344 --> 00:01:11.659
for the mutual fund to process their share redemption.

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.739
However, the price of closed-end funds is determined by

00:01:15.739 --> 00:01:20.099
the supply and demand of that funds shares on an exchange,

00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:26.194
and often will not precisely reflect the fair market value of its underlying portfolio.

00:01:26.194 --> 00:01:30.319
In other words, closed-end funds often trade at

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:35.644
a discount or premium to the net asset value other underlying holdings.

00:01:35.644 --> 00:01:37.334
In a later lesson,

00:01:37.334 --> 00:01:40.729
we'll see how exchange traded funds are designed to

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.870
improve upon both open-end and closed-end funds.
