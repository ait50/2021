00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.860
Indices may use both the market cap and the growth versus the value classification,

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.330
to decide which stocks to include.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.355
So as an example,

00:00:10.355 --> 00:00:15.425
the S&amp;P devised a list of stocks into the S&amp;P 500,

00:00:15.425 --> 00:00:20.769
S&amp;P MidCap 400 and the S&amp;P SmallCap 600.

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:27.655
The S&amp;P 500 contains large-cap stocks such as Lockheed Martin, an aerospace company.

00:00:27.655 --> 00:00:34.730
The S&amp;P MidCap 400 contains stocks such as Delfi and automotive technology company.

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:40.924
The S&amp;P SmallCap 600 contains a small-cap stocks such as The New York Times.

00:00:40.924 --> 00:00:43.129
Within each of these indices,

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.734
the stocks are then ranked as more growth or more value according to price-to-earnings,

00:00:48.734 --> 00:00:52.189
price-to-sales, for price-to-book value ratios.

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:58.989
These rankings are used to create more subgroups defined as either growth or value.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.950
For example, from the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 list,

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.640
stocks are selected for

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:13.129
the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 growth index or the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 Value Index.
