00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.509
An important consideration for any investor or

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:07.625
a portfolio manager is the cost of buying and selling stocks.

00:00:07.625 --> 00:00:10.654
These are called transaction costs.

00:00:10.654 --> 00:00:16.689
Transaction costs can be commissions paid to brokers or bargain-making investment banks.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.100
Transaction costs can also be the costs of

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.445
moving the market price by trading a large block of shares.

00:00:24.445 --> 00:00:27.600
Large institutional investors are primarily

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.815
concerned with moving the market price by making large trades.

00:00:31.815 --> 00:00:36.975
For example, if a fund wants to buy a stock that it considers underpriced,

00:00:36.975 --> 00:00:41.250
a large purchase of many shares will push up the market price of

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.670
that stock making the original purchase decision less attractive.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.140
Usually, traders will break up the order into smaller pieces and make the purchases with

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.929
different sellers on different exchanges in

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:57.465
order to prevent these sellers from raising their prices.

00:00:57.465 --> 00:01:00.710
Portfolio managers need to consider how

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.370
different strategies affect their overall transaction costs.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:10.670
For instance, if a strategy requires buying or selling based on daily price movements,

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.120
this will incur more transaction costs compared to

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.600
another strategy that triggers trading based on quarterly financial reports.

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:24.144
When a portfolio manager decides to adjust their investment allocation,

00:01:24.144 --> 00:01:27.569
this adjustment is called portfolio rebalancing.

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:29.764
When rebalancing a portfolio,

00:01:29.765 --> 00:01:34.969
a portfolio manager may decided that due to transaction costs it makes more sense

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:40.609
to skip trades for which the transaction costs outweigh the benefits of rebalancing.

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:45.829
Moreover, for large institutional investors that manage multiple funds,

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.429
they can trade internally between funds that are within the institution,

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.070
thereby reducing the cost of rebalancing.
