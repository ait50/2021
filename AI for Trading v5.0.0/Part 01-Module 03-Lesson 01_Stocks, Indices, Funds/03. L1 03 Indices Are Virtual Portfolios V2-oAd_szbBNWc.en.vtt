00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
An important point to keep in mind is that an index is a virtual portfolio,

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.410
and not an actual fund that people invest in.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.210
We can think of an index has a fantasy football team in which

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.144
sports fans pick their favorite players and put them in a virtual team.

00:00:17.144 --> 00:00:21.449
We can track the performance of this artificially constructed team by combining

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.074
the performance metrics such as number of points scored for each player.

00:00:26.074 --> 00:00:31.544
But keep in mind that the team only exists in paper not in real life.

00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:33.145
There's no team owner,

00:00:33.145 --> 00:00:37.484
no coach and the members in the virtual team don't actually practice together.

00:00:37.484 --> 00:00:43.159
Similarly, an index represents the aggregated performance of a group of stocks.

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:47.750
But they're not funds they're not managed by professional money managers,

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.469
and investors don't pay index creators to invest their money in the indices.
