00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.044
What is an index?

00:00:02.044 --> 00:00:05.484
If you're listening to financial news about the U.S. markets,

00:00:05.485 --> 00:00:08.894
you may hear about the S&amp;P or the Dow.

00:00:08.894 --> 00:00:10.884
For news about Latin America,

00:00:10.884 --> 00:00:13.390
there is IBOVESPA or MERVAL.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.015
For markets in Asia,

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:17.024
there's the NIKKEI or HANG SENG,

00:00:17.024 --> 00:00:20.704
and in Europe, there's the FTSE or EURO STOXX.

00:00:20.704 --> 00:00:24.244
These are all examples of indices.

00:00:24.245 --> 00:00:27.250
Indices are created by financial research,

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.539
and credit rating companies such as Standard and Poor's,

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.670
Dow Jones and Financial Times.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.560
They're also published by

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.870
stock exchanges such as the Nasdaq or the London Stock Exchange.

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:43.390
Indices can also be created by banks such as Hang Seng bank.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.049
Business news will often refer to whether the index went up or down.

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:53.459
For instance, we may hear that the Dow went up by 200 points since yesterday.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.545
If the Dow was at 25,000 yesterday,

00:00:56.545 --> 00:01:00.760
that means it is now 25,200 points today.

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:06.409
The 200-point increase, a bounce to an increase of about 0.8 percent.

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.899
An index is a metric that represents

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.085
the aggregated value of a group of stocks as a single number.

00:01:13.084 --> 00:01:19.269
Note that you can refer to more than one index as indexes or indices.
