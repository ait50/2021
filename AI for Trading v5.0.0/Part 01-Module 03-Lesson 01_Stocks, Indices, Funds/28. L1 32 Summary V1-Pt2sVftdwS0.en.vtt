00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.290
In this lesson, we learned about indices,

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.734
mutual funds, and hedge funds.

00:00:05.735 --> 00:00:10.905
We learned how indices may either be market cap-weighted or price-weighted.

00:00:10.904 --> 00:00:13.769
We also saw an example of how to construct

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.000
an index and update its value from one day to the next.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.484
We learned about mutual funds and hedge funds.

00:00:21.484 --> 00:00:26.800
We discussed the concept of actively managed funds versus passively managed funds.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.714
We also introduced the idea of Alpha,

00:00:29.714 --> 00:00:32.005
Beta, and Spark Beta.

00:00:32.005 --> 00:00:35.820
Moreover, we defined a fund's relative returns as

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.250
the fund's performance relative to its benchmark,

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.625
which is usually an index.

00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:47.210
We also learned about open-end mutual funds and closed-end mutual funds.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.240
We saw how open-end funds need to handle

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.185
customer withdrawals and therefore hold cash reserves.

00:00:54.185 --> 00:00:59.535
We also saw how closed-end funds are designed to address this issue.

00:00:59.534 --> 00:01:03.369
We also pointed out that the market price of a closed-end fund

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:07.509
may trade at a premium or a discount to its fair value.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.230
In the next lesson,

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.109
you will build upon these concepts and learn how

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:16.594
exchange-traded funds are designed to improve upon mutual funds.

00:01:16.594 --> 00:01:19.159
See you soon.
