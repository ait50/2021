00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.495
Let's first define the terms Equity, Stocks and Shares.

00:00:04.495 --> 00:00:07.835
What does it mean when an investor buys stocks.

00:00:07.835 --> 00:00:12.955
When you get a new job and the company pays you in shares what does that mean?

00:00:12.955 --> 00:00:17.384
Equity, is the value of a company's assets minus it's liabilities,

00:00:17.385 --> 00:00:21.990
is the net value of the company after counting for everything in the company owes.

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:26.539
Such as debt, payments to suppliers, or employee wages.

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.844
A company's equity, is divided into stock certificates that investors can buy.

00:00:31.844 --> 00:00:34.214
These can be called shares of the company,

00:00:34.215 --> 00:00:35.850
or stock in the company.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.640
Stock and shares pretty much refer to the same concept.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.494
When you say you own stock,

00:00:41.494 --> 00:00:45.314
people know you're referring to shares in one or more companies.

00:00:45.314 --> 00:00:47.119
When you say you own shares,

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:50.449
you normally specify shares, any specific company.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.200
So, when an investors purchase stocks,

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.060
or if employees receive shares from their employers,

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.554
they're receiving partial ownership of a company's equity.

00:00:59.554 --> 00:01:04.040
Now, let's say you're trying to follow how well the overall markets are doing.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.875
So, you look at a bunch of stocks and you may see

00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:09.920
that Google was down yesterday but up today,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.870
while IBM was up yesterday and then down today,

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.689
and Amazon was up both yesterday and today.

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.284
How do you consolidate all this information

00:01:20.284 --> 00:01:23.435
into a single number in a way that's meaningful?

00:01:23.435 --> 00:01:29.219
As you'll see next, we can use an index to help us track not only these companies,

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:34.039
but also hundreds and even thousands of companies using a single number.
