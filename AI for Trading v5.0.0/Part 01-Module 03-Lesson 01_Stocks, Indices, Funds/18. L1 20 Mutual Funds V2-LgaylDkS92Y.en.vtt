00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.865
Now, that we've had an overview of funds.

00:00:02.865 --> 00:00:09.004
Let's discuss two general types of funds: mutual funds and hedge funds.

00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:11.220
Mutual funds are available to

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.300
everyday investors and have restrictions on certain strategies,

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.515
such as shorting stocks or using derivatives.

00:00:18.515 --> 00:00:21.469
So, they're usually long only,

00:00:21.469 --> 00:00:24.179
which means fund managers buy and hold

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.789
stocks that they expect will perform well in the future.

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.399
Investors are allowed to put money into or pull

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.869
money out of most mutual funds on any business day.

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:39.954
In other words, there's no lock-up periods that prevent investors from withdrawing.

00:00:39.954 --> 00:00:44.589
Some popular mutual funds include the Vanguard Equity Income Fund,

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.560
the T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund,

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.870
and the BlackRock Technology Opportunities Fund.
