00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
Holding cash means that the portfolio cannot make

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.955
use of all of its assets in the given investment strategy.

00:00:06.955 --> 00:00:12.480
Also, if many investors wish to redeem their investments at the same time,

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.969
the fund may need to sell their existing investments to get cash and increase liquidity.

00:00:17.969 --> 00:00:22.614
These issues may reduce the overall potential return of the fund.

00:00:22.614 --> 00:00:28.774
To see this, imagine you invested a million dollars into an open-end mutual fund.

00:00:28.774 --> 00:00:33.519
The fund allocates half of this investments into a portfolio of equities,

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.370
earning a 10 percent return.

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:40.854
The fund keeps the other half of its investments in cash, earning two percent.

00:00:40.854 --> 00:00:46.164
What do you think will be the total rate of return on your million-dollar investment?

00:00:46.164 --> 00:00:48.104
Well, first of all,

00:00:48.104 --> 00:00:51.379
congratulations on having a million dollars to invest.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.359
Second of all, you'll probably guess that your rate of return will be less than

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:58.325
the 10 percent return on the portfolio of

00:00:58.325 --> 00:01:02.325
equities because only half of your money is allocated to it.

00:01:02.325 --> 00:01:07.609
The return on the fund is a weighted average of the active investments and the cash.

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:12.420
In other words, a half of 10 percent is 5.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.935
A half of 2 percent is 1.

00:01:15.935 --> 00:01:20.185
5 plus 1 is 6 percent.

00:01:20.185 --> 00:01:23.805
So, the total return of the fund is 6 percent,

00:01:23.805 --> 00:01:28.000
which is less than the 10 percent return of the equities.
