00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.474
Let's learn about active fund management versus passive fund management.

00:00:05.474 --> 00:00:09.349
When the goal of a fund is to outperform an index,

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:12.074
it's called an actively managed fund.

00:00:12.074 --> 00:00:15.734
For example the Fidelity Contrafund targets

00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:21.375
large cap growth stocks and seeks to outperform the S and P 500 index.

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:24.670
When the goal is to match the performance of an index,

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.350
it's called a passively managed fund.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:33.340
A passive fund usually chooses an index as a benchmark that it tries to track.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.140
So they're often called index funds.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.859
The fund managers do this by buying the same stocks that are

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:44.479
listed by the index and in the same proportion as the index.

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:48.289
Note that an index fund is not an index.

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.594
It's a fund that attempts to match the performance of an index.

00:00:52.594 --> 00:00:58.250
For example: The Vanguard 500 index Investor Fund is a fund that

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:05.329
allocates investor money towards a portfolio that tries to match the S and P 500 index.
