00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.919
Note that Active Funds,

00:00:01.919 --> 00:00:04.349
are sometimes called Alpha Funds.

00:00:04.349 --> 00:00:08.529
While Passive Funds are sometimes called Beta Funds.

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:11.974
So, where do the names alpha and beta come from?

00:00:11.974 --> 00:00:18.464
Well, alpha and beta refer to the intercept and coefficient of a regression line.

00:00:18.464 --> 00:00:20.969
In particular, this is the regression of

00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:26.515
a portfolio's return against the markets return in excess of the risk-free rate.

00:00:26.515 --> 00:00:29.710
In general, a portfolio's excess return,

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.484
is the portfolio's return minus the risk-free rate.

00:00:33.484 --> 00:00:38.679
A beta coefficient of one means that a two percent increase in the market,

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:42.844
will also result in a two percent increase in the portfolio.

00:00:42.844 --> 00:00:46.699
An intercept or alpha of one means that

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.330
the portfolio has a one percent return that exists,

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.664
even if the market's excess return is zero.

00:00:53.664 --> 00:00:55.579
You'll get more details about

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.324
this particular regression line in a later lesson about portfolio optimization.

00:01:00.325 --> 00:01:02.445
But the goal of an active fund,

00:01:02.445 --> 00:01:06.650
is to generate excess returns above the market's excess return.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.830
Hence, is called an Alpha Fund.

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:12.319
The goal of a passive fund is to

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:15.494
closely match the returns of the market that is tracking.

00:01:15.495 --> 00:01:18.730
So, it's called a Beta Fund.
