00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.315
So, let's say an Index like the Nikkei 225,

00:00:04.315 --> 00:00:08.155
tracks the price movements of 225 stocks.

00:00:08.154 --> 00:00:10.459
To get a single Index number,

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.350
we could add up the single share price of all of the 225 stocks,

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.410
and there's your index number.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.105
That's more or less what the Nikkei 225 Index does,

00:00:21.105 --> 00:00:24.530
and this is called Price Weighting, or Equal Weighting.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.440
The Dow Jones Index is also a Price-Weighted Index.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.460
Note, that Index creators usually rescale the number,

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.730
but we'll see that later in the lesson.
