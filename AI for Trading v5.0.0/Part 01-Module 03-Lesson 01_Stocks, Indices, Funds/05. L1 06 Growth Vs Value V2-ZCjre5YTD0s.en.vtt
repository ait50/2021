00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
Indices can also include stocks based on

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.070
whether companies are considered growth or value stocks.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.565
So, what's a growth stock,

00:00:08.564 --> 00:00:10.224
and what's a value stock?

00:00:10.224 --> 00:00:13.019
A growth stock tends to have high growth in

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.379
sales or earnings and potential for future growth.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.279
For example, if a company creates new ways for people to make

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.920
purchases with bitcoin or new ways for people to commute to work,

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.230
it might be considered a growth stock because

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.850
of its potential for increased future sales.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:36.630
A value stock tends to be a mature company that has stable sales, revenue, and earnings.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.975
For example, a company that sells

00:00:38.975 --> 00:00:43.370
household and bathroom products may have a stable flow of earnings,

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:46.399
but has fewer expectations for rapid growth.
