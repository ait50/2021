00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.679
Note that open-end mutual funds must keep part of their investments in cash,

00:00:04.679 --> 00:00:07.794
in case investors wish to redeem their shares.

00:00:07.794 --> 00:00:11.400
For example, let's say an open-end fund has issued

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.030
10 shares and the shares are worth $100 each,

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:18.625
one investor wishes to return their shares for cash.

00:00:18.625 --> 00:00:23.949
The investor gets their $100 in cash and the fund has nine shares outstanding,

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.809
with investments valued at $900.

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:29.873
In anticipation of potential withdrawals,

00:00:29.873 --> 00:00:35.129
the fund has kept some of its $1,000 in cash and not invested in stocks.
