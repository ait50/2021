00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
You may wonder what happens to an index if one of its listed companies goes bankrupt,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.370
is acquired, or merges with another company.

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:13.629
For example, in June of 2018, Monsanto,

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.710
a US based agriculture company was acquired by Bayer,

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.670
a pharmaceutical company based in Germany.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.255
Monsanto was listed in the S&amp;P 500,

00:00:24.254 --> 00:00:25.884
but due to the acquisition,

00:00:25.885 --> 00:00:30.150
Standard &amp; Poor's removed Monsanto from the S&amp;P 500,

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:33.074
which is called an Index delete.

00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:37.805
Standard &amp; Poor's also added Twitter to the S&amp;P 500,

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:40.225
which is called an Index add.

00:00:40.225 --> 00:00:43.280
When the list of companies in an index changes,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.500
the index needs to be rebalanced.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.920
In other words, the weights applies to each stock must be

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.885
recalculated based on the new total market cap of all stocks in the index.

00:00:53.884 --> 00:00:58.309
Now, we'll cover how an index is constructed and calculated next.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.100
Industry balancing can be scheduled at predetermined intervals,

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.435
such as every month,

00:01:03.435 --> 00:01:05.780
every quarter, or every year.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.924
An index may also be rebalanced on the day of a major event such as during a merger,

00:01:10.924 --> 00:01:15.069
acquisition, privatization, or bankruptcy.
