00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.375
Going back to the issue of index deletes and index adds,

00:00:04.375 --> 00:00:09.589
when Monsanto was removed from the SMP 500 and replaced by Twitter,

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:11.359
what happened to the index?

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:13.484
Was it reset back to 100?

00:00:13.484 --> 00:00:16.859
Is there's some fancy math to update the index?

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.439
Well in fact, we use the same math as we did before.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.405
Prior to the replacement Monsanto was worth about $50 billion.

00:00:26.405 --> 00:00:30.845
On the day of replacement Twitter was worth about $30 billion.

00:00:30.844 --> 00:00:35.670
Let's make up a fake company to serve as a placeholder for Monsanto before,

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.890
and Twitter after the change.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.024
Let's call this fake company, MonsanTwitter.

00:00:41.024 --> 00:00:43.625
Between the previous day and the current day,

00:00:43.625 --> 00:00:50.390
our placeholder MonsanTwitter changed its market cap from $50 billion to $30 billion.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.990
We calculate the percent change of the total market cap as

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:59.130
usual and apply that to the previous index to get the current day's index.
