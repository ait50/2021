00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.674
So, here's the question,

00:00:02.674 --> 00:00:06.125
can a fund only be active versus passive,

00:00:06.125 --> 00:00:08.535
only alpha or beta?

00:00:08.535 --> 00:00:11.005
Well, if you're at a restaurant,

00:00:11.005 --> 00:00:14.240
do you have to choose between soup or salad?

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.454
Does your beverage have to be either milk or tea?

00:00:18.454 --> 00:00:21.029
What if you wanted a little bit of both?

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.815
In fact, you can order a half soup and a half salad combo.

00:00:25.815 --> 00:00:28.665
You can also order a milk tea.

00:00:28.664 --> 00:00:33.984
Similarly, a portfolio can combine both active and passive management.

00:00:33.984 --> 00:00:37.679
This is often referred to as Smart Beta.

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:41.780
Generally speaking, the idea is to start with the weights based on

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.450
an existing index and use that as

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.890
a starting point from which we can try to make improvements.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.960
So, for instance, if we can nudge

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.590
the weights a little up or down from their original values,

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.040
then we can aim to either improve returns or reduce risk.

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.484
We call these Smart Beta portfolios because they're

00:01:02.484 --> 00:01:06.530
beta portfolios that have some alpha sprinkled on top.
