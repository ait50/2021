00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
Then, there are hedge funds.

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.359
Hedge funds have fewer restrictions on their trading strategies,

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.880
which allow them to take short positions and also

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.285
use derivatives such as options or futures.

00:00:12.285 --> 00:00:14.910
Hedge funds typically take money from

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.425
high-net-worth individuals or institutions such as pension funds.

00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:23.725
Hedge funds generally require a higher minimum investment,

00:00:23.725 --> 00:00:26.400
and may require lockup periods during

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:29.564
which investors are not allowed to withdraw their investments.

00:00:29.564 --> 00:00:31.734
So, here's a question for you to ponder.

00:00:31.734 --> 00:00:34.670

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.410

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:42.224
who play in the hedges of a rose garden or B,

00:00:42.225 --> 00:00:47.810
hedge funds are named after hedging strategies designed to limit portfolio risk?

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.600
You'll find out the correct answer by the end of this lesson so stay tuned.
