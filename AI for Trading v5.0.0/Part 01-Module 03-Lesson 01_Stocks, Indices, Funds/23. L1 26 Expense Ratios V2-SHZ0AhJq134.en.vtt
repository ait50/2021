00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.910
Usually, the expenses associated with

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.900
the fund are defined as a fraction of assets under management,

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.780
which is called the gross expense ratio.

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:14.699
Sometimes, when funds are just starting out and trying to attract investors,

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:17.129
they give discounts to their new customers.

00:00:17.129 --> 00:00:21.829
So, these customers actually pay less than the gross expense ratio.

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:24.764
This is called the net expense ratio.

00:00:24.765 --> 00:00:28.550
Note however, that discounts are usually not permanent.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.660
So, the gross expense ratio is

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.130
a better indicator of what investors will pay in the long run.
