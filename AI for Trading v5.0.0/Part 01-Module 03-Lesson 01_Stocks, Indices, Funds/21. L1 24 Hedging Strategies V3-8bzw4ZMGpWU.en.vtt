00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.779
Hedge funds employ hedging strategies,

00:00:02.779 --> 00:00:05.984
in an attempt to deliver a market neutral returns.

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:09.449
By market neutral, I mean that the portfolio's gains or

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:13.179
losses are less affected by overall market movements.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:16.109
Hedging generally means entering into

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.089
a transaction in order to reduce exposures to price fluctuations.

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:26.140
This is done by buying derivatives such as options or futures.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.265
For instance, let's say we hold 100 shares of Daimler,

00:00:30.265 --> 00:00:33.640
the owner of car brands such as Mercedes-Benz.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.340
We want to ensure against losses if the stock price of Daimler drops.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.695
So, we buy 100 put options on shares in Daimler.

00:00:42.695 --> 00:00:46.340
As an example, each put option gives us the option to

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.620
sell one Daimler share at a fixed price of 60 euros.

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:55.184
So, one would be a good time to exercise that right to sell.

00:00:55.185 --> 00:01:01.510
Well, if the market price of Daimler drops below 60 euros such as 50 euros.

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:04.984
We could buy Daimler stock at 50 euros per share.

00:01:04.984 --> 00:01:09.670
Use the put option to sell the same stock at 60 euros.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.344
We could keep that 10 euros per share as profit.

00:01:13.344 --> 00:01:16.474
This could cancel out the 10-euro per share loss

00:01:16.474 --> 00:01:20.309
that we would incur on our existing 100 shares.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.115
Hedging helps money managers devise investment strategies that are market neutral,

00:01:26.114 --> 00:01:31.000
which means that gains or losses are less sensitive to movements in the overall market.
