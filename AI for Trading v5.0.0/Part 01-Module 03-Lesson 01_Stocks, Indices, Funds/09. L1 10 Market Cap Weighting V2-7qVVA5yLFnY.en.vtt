00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
We can also take a weighted average of

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.040
the stocks in a way that does not treat all the stocks the same.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.705
A sensible choice for weights is to give

00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:13.080
more weight to stocks of bigger companies rather than

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.589
smaller companies because a larger company's price moving

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:20.795
has a greater effect on the overall change in the stock market.

00:00:20.795 --> 00:00:23.625
This is called market cap weighting.

00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:27.015
Remember, that market capitalization of a company

00:00:27.015 --> 00:00:30.679
is the number of shares times the market price per share.

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:35.210
So, for example, the Wilshire 5000 Index is

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.884
market cap weighted and contains both Nvidia and iRobot.

00:00:39.884 --> 00:00:44.674
Nvidia has a market cap of about 160 billion.

00:00:44.674 --> 00:00:49.640
While, iRobot has a market cap of about 1.8 billion.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.359
This means that a one percent change in the price of Nvidia will affect

00:00:54.359 --> 00:01:00.295
the Wilshire 5000 Index more than a one percent change in the price of iRobot.

00:01:00.295 --> 00:01:06.424
Major indices that are market-capitalization weighted are the S&amp;P 500,

00:01:06.424 --> 00:01:10.084
Ibovespa, MERVAL, Hang Seng,

00:01:10.084 --> 00:01:12.869
FTSE and EURO STOXX.
