00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
When an investor puts money into a fund,

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.940
they receive shares in the fund which increase or

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.060
decrease in value as the funds portfolio value goes up or down.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.535
The share represents a fraction of the funds fair value.

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:17.120
To get the fair value of a fund's share,

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.545
we start with the value of its investments,

00:00:19.545 --> 00:00:22.620
also called its Assets Under Management,

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.960
or AUM for short.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.325
We take the AUM minus expenses,

00:00:28.324 --> 00:00:33.149
these expenses are the costs of running the fund such as employee salaries,

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.879
transaction costs, and taxes.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.640
We then take the net value of the fund and divide by the number of shares in the fund.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.865
The fair value per share that we get is called Net Asset Value or NAV.

00:00:47.865 --> 00:00:50.730
This is often just pronounced NAV.
