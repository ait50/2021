00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.118
There are two ways that funds are evaluated on their performance,

00:00:04.118 --> 00:00:07.279
relative versus absolute returns.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.794
Relative returns refer to how the fund compares to a benchmark,

00:00:11.794 --> 00:00:14.120
which is usually an index.

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:17.155
Mutual funds, both active and passive,

00:00:17.155 --> 00:00:20.399
are evaluated relative to their benchmark.

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:22.380
Let's say for example,

00:00:22.379 --> 00:00:25.980
that an actively managed fund chooses to focus on a portfolio of

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.269
stocks that are also listed in the S&amp;P 500 index.

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:37.280
If the S&amp;P 500 has an annual return of two percent and the fund returns three percent,

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.105
then the fund outperformed its benchmark by one percent,

00:00:41.104 --> 00:00:44.934
and we say that the relative return was one percent.

00:00:44.935 --> 00:00:47.780
Since this is an actively managed fund,

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.060
we also refer to this relative return as the active return.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.195
For a passively managed fund,

00:00:54.195 --> 00:00:58.750
the performance is based on how closely the fund attracts index.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.370
For example, if the S&amp;P 500 had an annual return of two percent,

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.719
and so did the passively managed fund,

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:09.674
then the fund is meeting its investment objective.

00:01:09.674 --> 00:01:12.344
The relative return is zero,

00:01:12.344 --> 00:01:15.075
and since this is a passively managed fund,

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:19.530
we say that the fund has a zero percent tracking error.
