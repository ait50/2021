00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
Mutual funds receive investor money,

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.439
which they invest in a portfolio of stocks or other assets.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.484
In exchange, investors receive shares in the fund.

00:00:10.484 --> 00:00:13.209
For example, when a fund starts,

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.359
investors may pay $100 for each share of the fund that they receive.

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.759
There are two types of mutual funds;

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.995
open-end funds and closed-end funds.

00:00:23.995 --> 00:00:28.435
Open-end mutual funds, allow investors to buy into the fund,

00:00:28.434 --> 00:00:32.879
after the fund has already started operating and investing.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.745
Open-end funds, also let existing investors withdraw their money from the fund directly.

00:00:38.744 --> 00:00:40.599
When people want to invest,

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.760
the open-end fund creates new shares for the investors to buy.

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:47.554
When investors wish to withdraw their money,

00:00:47.554 --> 00:00:50.269
they turn in their shares and the fund returns

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.885
the cash value of those shares back to the investors.

00:00:53.884 --> 00:00:58.864
The fund also removes these shares from his total shares outstanding.

00:00:58.865 --> 00:01:01.395
Let's walk through an example.

00:01:01.395 --> 00:01:05.030
Let's pretend a new open-end fund initially has

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.269
10 investors and each investor buys one share of the fund at $100 per share.

00:01:11.269 --> 00:01:16.314
So, the fund takes this $1,000 to invest in a portfolio of stocks.

00:01:16.314 --> 00:01:22.459
We say it has $1,000 in assets under management or AUM.

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:27.809
A month later, let's say the portfolio's value has increased to $1,200.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.254
So, each of the ten shares is worth $120.

00:01:32.254 --> 00:01:35.844
A new investor wants to buy a share of the fund.

00:01:35.844 --> 00:01:41.459
So, they pay $120 for a share and not 100.

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:46.459
In other words, the new investor pays for the current price of the share.

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:56.469
The fund has now issued 11 shares and has $1,200 plus 120 or $1,320 in his portfolio.
