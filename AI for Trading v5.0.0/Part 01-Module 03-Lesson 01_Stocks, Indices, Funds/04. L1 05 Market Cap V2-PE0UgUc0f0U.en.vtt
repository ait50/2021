00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.639
So far we've seen some major indices that track a large collection of stocks,

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:10.710
from big to small with different sectors such as technology or banking.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.530
What if we wanted a more refined look at

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:19.734
just the smaller companies or what if we wanted to track just high-growth companies.

00:00:19.734 --> 00:00:23.100
Having a more specific index would help if

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.955
our investment research is focused on companies with similar characteristics.

00:00:27.954 --> 00:00:31.939
Index creators often make indices that group stocks by

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.990
market capitalization defined as large-cap, mid-cap or small-cap.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.960
Market capitalization or market cap of a company is

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.424
its number of shares outstanding times the price per share.

00:00:46.424 --> 00:00:50.799
In other words; market cap is the market value of the company.
