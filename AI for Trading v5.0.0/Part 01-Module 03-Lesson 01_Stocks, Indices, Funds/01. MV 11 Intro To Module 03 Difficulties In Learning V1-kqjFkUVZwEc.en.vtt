00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.644
Hi there. These next few lessons we'll give you a broad overview of mutual funds,

00:00:05.644 --> 00:00:08.769
hedge funds, and exchange traded funds.

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.265
The second half will be a deep dive into portfolio optimization,

00:00:13.265 --> 00:00:16.199
which is really exciting because it will help you build the

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.589
mathematical skill sets that you'll want to have as a quant.

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:23.785
Now, I have to admit that math tends to scare me sometimes.

00:00:23.785 --> 00:00:28.134
Well actually, okay, math always scares me a lot.

00:00:28.135 --> 00:00:30.885
But math is also very cool.

00:00:30.885 --> 00:00:32.310
When you learn the math,

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.204
its like gaining superpowers that let you extract meaning from the chaos of numbers.

00:00:37.204 --> 00:00:40.549
With that said, we'd still like to acknowledge that

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:44.154
diving into the math can still feel scary or overwhelming,

00:00:44.155 --> 00:00:49.429
especially when you feel like it's just you alone in a library or a coffee shop.

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:52.704
I've been through several Eudacity Nano degrees as a student,

00:00:52.704 --> 00:00:57.049
and I also felt like sometimes it was just me and my computer in a library.

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:59.839
I'd like to share a bit of advice for getting through

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.290
the more challenging material in an online learning environment.

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:05.299
What really helped me get through some of

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:10.024
the more challenging subjects was reaching out online to interact with my classmates.

00:01:10.025 --> 00:01:12.425
I'd either ask questions when I was stuck,

00:01:12.424 --> 00:01:14.765
or tried to answer other student questions.

00:01:14.765 --> 00:01:17.549
I would also post curriculum suggestions,

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.554
and sometimes I'd get a response from someone at Eudacity.

00:01:20.555 --> 00:01:24.830
Whether your online chats directly answered the question you're trying to solve,

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:28.215
they help you by building a community that supports you,

00:01:28.215 --> 00:01:29.924
and also motivates you.

00:01:29.924 --> 00:01:32.689
It's one of the important side benefits that you've

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:35.664
already experienced when you take in-person classes,

00:01:35.665 --> 00:01:40.050
because you're surrounded by other people with shared goals and shared experiences,

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.174
because they have empathy for you and your struggles.

00:01:43.174 --> 00:01:44.994
In the Eudacity classroom,

00:01:44.995 --> 00:01:50.954
your classmates and mentors are there with you too just connected by modern technology.

00:01:50.954 --> 00:01:55.978
Also, we want to remind you that there's a whole team of people at Eudacity,

00:01:55.978 --> 00:01:59.209
many of whom may not necessarily be on camera,

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:02.049
that are working to support you on your journey.

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.140
We encourage you to regularly connect with your fellow classmates so that

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.000
you can support each other on your journey through the program.
