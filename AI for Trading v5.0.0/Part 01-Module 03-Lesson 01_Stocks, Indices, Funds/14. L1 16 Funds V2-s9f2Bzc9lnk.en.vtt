00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.384
Now, let's define an investment fund.

00:00:03.384 --> 00:00:07.019
An investment fund is a collection of investor money that

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:12.169
a professional money manager allocates toward a portfolio of assets.

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:16.320
So, what's the benefit of investing in a portfolio of stocks?

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.629
Why not just pick your favorite 10 stocks and watch them grow?

00:00:20.629 --> 00:00:27.390
Well, portfolio's benefit from diversification enable investors to get the same level of

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.375
return with lower risk or similarly more return for the same level of risk.

00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:38.549
In effect, a portfolio let's you optimize your Sharpe ratio,

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:41.509
which is the measure of how much you're rewarded for buying

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:45.994
risky assets divided by the risk of that portfolio.

00:00:45.994 --> 00:00:50.224
You'll learn more about the Sharpe ratio in a later lesson, but for now,

00:00:50.225 --> 00:00:54.289
just remember that a smart combination of assets together can give

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.789
you better returns or less risk than a single stock can achieve.

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.589
You may notice that there are many mutual funds to choose from.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.930
Each of these target a certain subset of assets,

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.375
have specific investment strategies and also aim for a certain level of risk.

00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:16.299
Investors can choose different funds based on their level of risk tolerance,

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:22.269
the amount of fees charged by the fund and also based on the fund's past performance.
