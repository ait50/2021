00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.724
So, how do we define whether a company is growth or value?

00:00:05.724 --> 00:00:09.980
We can look at valuation metrics such as price to earnings ratio,

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.595
price to sales ratio,

00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:13.540
and price to book ratio.

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:16.949
Then, within a list of companies in an index,

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.640
we can rank these stocks by these metrics and say that a stock

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.964
is more on one end of the spectrum relative to the other stocks.

00:00:24.964 --> 00:00:26.969
The price to earnings ratio,

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:28.849
is the stock price divided by

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.620
the company's earnings per share over the past four quarters.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.559
The price to sales ratio,

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.155
is the stock price divided by the sales per share over the past four quarters.

00:00:39.155 --> 00:00:41.210
The price to book ratio,

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.590
is the stock price divided by the book value per share.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.665
The book value is the company's accounting value which is assets minus liabilities.

00:00:50.664 --> 00:00:53.490
The book value differs from the market value,

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.855
which we've been referring to as the market capitalization,

00:00:56.854 --> 00:00:59.689
which varies as the stock price changes.

00:00:59.689 --> 00:01:03.159
Growth stocks tend to have high price to earnings,

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:06.219
price to sales and price to book ratios.

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:10.605
Conversely, value stocks tend to have lower price to Earnings,

00:01:10.605 --> 00:01:13.669
price to sales, and price to book ratios.

00:01:13.668 --> 00:01:17.899
Note that these ratios tend to vary by sector and industry.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.315
Generally speaking, software and biotechnology stocks have higher PE ratios,

00:01:23.314 --> 00:01:28.670
while agriculture and construction companies tend to have lower PE ratios.
