00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.820
Welcome to this module,

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:05.530
and congratulations on getting through the previous modules and projects.

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.150
In this lesson, we'll learn about Stocks, Indices and Funds.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.679
We'll cover how Indices are defined and categorized.

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.829
We'll also learn about market capitalization and price-weighted indices,

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:21.299
and walk through an example of constructing an index.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.565
Then, we'll learn about funds,

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:26.010
such as hedge funds and mutual funds.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.200
We'll cover active versus passive fund management as well as smart beta.

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.085
We'll also learn about open-end and close-end mutual funds

00:00:35.085 --> 00:00:38.850
which will prepare us for the next lesson about exchange traded funds.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.660
In later lessons of this module we'll calculate

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:45.884
portfolio risk and return and study optimal risky portfolios.

00:00:45.884 --> 00:00:50.420
Finally, we'll cover portfolio optimization which will equip you with the skills to

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.329
construct portfolios with a goal of maximizing returns and minimizing risk.
