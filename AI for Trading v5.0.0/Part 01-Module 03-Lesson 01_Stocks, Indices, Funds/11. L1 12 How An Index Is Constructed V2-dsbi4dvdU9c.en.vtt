00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
Let's see how an index is constructed and

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.679
updated to see where the index number comes from.

00:00:06.679 --> 00:00:09.839
The Hang Seng Index was created by a banker,

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:13.830
Stan Lee Kuan at Hang Seng Bank in 1969,

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.065
and tracks the 50 largest companies that are listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

00:00:19.065 --> 00:00:22.710
The index selected the 50 largest companies that were traded on

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.925
the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and added up their market capitalization.

00:00:26.925 --> 00:00:31.925
Then, they set that sum equal to 100 points for the index.

00:00:31.925 --> 00:00:37.035
So the index began in 1969 with the number 100.

00:00:37.034 --> 00:00:40.729
Note that we will refer to the sum of market caps of

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:44.574
all these 50 companies as the total market cap.

00:00:44.575 --> 00:00:47.780
Each trading day, the percent change of

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.390
the total market cap is multiplied to the previous day's index,

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.250
to calculate the index for that day.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.149
For example, let's pretend the total market cap on

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.265
the very first day was 100 billion Hong Kong dollars.

00:01:03.265 --> 00:01:09.454
The following day, let's say the total market cap changed to 102 billion.

00:01:09.454 --> 00:01:12.109
Recall that we can get the percent change by

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:15.204
taking the current day divided by the previous day.

00:01:15.204 --> 00:01:16.635
So in this case,

00:01:16.635 --> 00:01:25.050
102 billion divided by 100 billion is 1.02 or a 2% increase.

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:31.129
If we multiply the first day's index of 100 points by 1.02,

00:01:31.129 --> 00:01:35.670
the second day's index value is now 102 points.
