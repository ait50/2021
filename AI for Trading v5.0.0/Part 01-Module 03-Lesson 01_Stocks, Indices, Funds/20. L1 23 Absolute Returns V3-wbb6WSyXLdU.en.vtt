00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.844
Hedge funds are usually evaluated by absolute returns.

00:00:04.844 --> 00:00:09.060
Absolute return funds use the cash interest rate such

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.394
as the US three-month Treasury rate or LIBOR as the benchmark.

00:00:13.394 --> 00:00:16.179
Since the cash rate is relatively small,

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:19.410
it doesn't fluctuate much compared to the equity markets.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.214
Absolute return funds are measured by their returns themselves,

00:00:23.214 --> 00:00:27.000
not the difference between the fund and the benchmark returns.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.664
The average return of hedge funds in 2017 was 8.5 percent,

00:00:32.664 --> 00:00:35.369
and 5.4 percent in 2016,

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:37.929
according to the Hedge Fund Research group.
