00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
Starting open-ended projects like some of the projects in

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.390
this nanodegree program or even like the project of

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:09.899
learning a whole new subject can feel bewildering.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.044
For example, starting the project of earning a PhD will certainly bewildering to me.

00:00:15.044 --> 00:00:18.300
It can be hard to proceed when you don't know what parts

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.719
of the information you're trying to learn will be important in the future.

00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:24.390
Frankly, there's an infinite amount of information in

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.750
the world and any part of it could lead to interesting places.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.384
That's one of the reasons why we try in this nanodegree program,

00:00:31.385 --> 00:00:34.179
to give you context for why you're learning things,

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:38.429
how they're relevant to your goals and how they'll be useful in the future.

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:41.255
Also, with unstructured problems,

00:00:41.255 --> 00:00:45.280
you may not really know when you have found the answer and are done.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.524
When I worked on unstructured problems during my PhD,

00:00:48.524 --> 00:00:51.949
it felt like trying to climb a set of stairs in the dark,

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.480
feeling around with my foot until I found a stair to step onto.

00:00:55.479 --> 00:01:00.250
What was helpful to me in this type of situation was to let goals be my guide.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.250
So, if I was trying to build something,

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.310
I would know I was done when it was built and it worked.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.730
If I was trying to analyze some data,

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.980
it was important to decide what question I was trying to answer,

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.245
and so I would know I was done when I had an answer to that question.

00:01:15.245 --> 00:01:17.570
Sometimes, the goals are obvious,

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:19.034
like finish a course,

00:01:19.034 --> 00:01:21.979
but sometimes you have to decide what the goals are,

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.295
like when you have to decide what questions you're trying to answer.

00:01:25.295 --> 00:01:28.640
We've provided you with some goals in your projects in

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.375
the form of rubric criteria to help you direct your efforts,

00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:35.000
but bigger picture, deciding what you are trying to

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.209
achieve can give you a way to measure your progress.

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:41.840
So, now that you've got some substantial progress under

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.505
your belt in this big project that is your nanodegree program,

00:01:45.504 --> 00:01:47.984
and growth journey that that's a part of,

00:01:47.984 --> 00:01:51.299
how are you feeling about the goals you've set out to achieve?

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.200
Recognize the headway that you've made so far,

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.704
in terms of what you've learned,

00:01:55.704 --> 00:01:57.319
reasoned through and created,

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:59.439
you're making great progress.
