00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.765
Now that you made your way through the material,

00:00:02.765 --> 00:00:05.189
you have a solid foundation in researching

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.285
a trading strategy which will help you with finding an alpha signal.

00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:11.599
The next step on your journey is to do Project

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.160
2 where you'll implement a breakout strategy.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.519
You'll take everything you learned from Project 1 to build this strategy,

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:19.390
along with finding and filtering Outliers.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.280
Transitions are really easy.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.000
In transitioning from lessons to projects and back again,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.530
sometimes it's difficult for an entity students.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.714
That's true. I've gone through multiple Eudacity Nanodegree programs as a student,

00:00:31.714 --> 00:00:33.950
and I have to admit that starting a project was

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.515
one of the loneliest parts of the process.

00:00:36.515 --> 00:00:39.204
I was a Eudacity student in the data analyst,

00:00:39.204 --> 00:00:41.844
machine learning and deep learning Nanodegrees.

00:00:41.844 --> 00:00:44.824
Every time I started a new project, I struggled.

00:00:44.825 --> 00:00:47.040
I didn't really know if I would ever finish.

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:47.464
Yeah.

00:00:47.465 --> 00:00:51.770
I would spend hours alone in the library just begging my code to magically work,

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.320
and searching the web and online forums for hints.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.929
So, there are definitely moments when I started to ask myself,

00:00:57.929 --> 00:00:59.229
"What am I doing here?

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:01.000
Why am I doing this to myself?"

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.280
That sounds really tough.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.025
How did you handle those moments?

00:01:04.025 --> 00:01:07.940
Well, whenever I felt like I couldn't bring myself to keep trying,

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.519
I would watch online guest speakers or interviews by

00:01:10.519 --> 00:01:14.060
people who did something really cool in the field that I was studying.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.740
So, it helped to remind me why I was interested in the Nanodegree program to begin with,

00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:20.519
and helped me to keep going forward.

00:01:20.519 --> 00:01:22.269
Yeah. That's a really great idea.

00:01:22.269 --> 00:01:24.784
If you're ever feeling burnt out or tired from

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:27.379
a day of debugging code or working on tough problems,

00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:29.449
take a few seconds to remind yourself of

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.799
what initially brought you to this Nanodegree program.

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.390
What do you want to do? Who do you hope to become?

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.090
Watch some YouTube videos about this innovative field in which you're growing,

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.090
maybe throw in a few cat and puppy videos along the way,

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.420
and when you feel that urge to move forward with your learning,

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.025
dive back into your program.

00:01:45.025 --> 00:01:48.080
Who knows where you'll go with your new skills and knowledge?
