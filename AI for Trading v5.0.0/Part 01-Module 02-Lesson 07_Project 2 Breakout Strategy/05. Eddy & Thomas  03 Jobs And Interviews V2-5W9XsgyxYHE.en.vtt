00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
We're here with Thomas John,

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.930
a Quantitative Portfolio Manager,

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.770
to talk about careers and job interviews for quant roles.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.580
So Thomas, how can someone start a career in the finance,

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.440
asset management, or banking?

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.810
Is the process more difficult that we're not coming

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.720
straight out of a brand name university or graduate school?

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.575
From what I've observed coming from a name brand institution

00:00:22.575 --> 00:00:26.475
is less important for a full-time jobs than for internships,

00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:28.800
which are limited in number.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.120
Cold resume submissions online for

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.270
listed openings actually does work contrary to what some people believe.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.525
I myself and others I know have received job offers in this way.

00:00:41.525 --> 00:00:45.310
Remember that your resume always does get looked at.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.540
If you know someone at the firm,

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.080
anyone who can send your resume to HR or the hiring manager,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.790
that will also help.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.535
This might be more necessary if your background is not an obvious match.

00:00:57.535 --> 00:01:02.255
But don't take wild shots at what you think is your dream job.

00:01:02.255 --> 00:01:06.170
First, see if you would be a useful hire to the role,

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.675
regardless of whether that is obvious to others or you have some convincing to do.

00:01:11.675 --> 00:01:14.090
Only if you're self-convinced,

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.905
try to make an attempt at it.

00:01:15.905 --> 00:01:19.220
Otherwise, it's going to be problematic for HR or

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.865
your internal contact to make that connection to the hiring manager.

00:01:22.865 --> 00:01:26.240
Another channel is to simply start in one area of

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.020
that firm that may be more suited to your current background,

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.045
and then move internally within the firm over the years into other roles.

00:01:35.045 --> 00:01:40.855
For example, contrary to myths about having to start in the right vertical,

00:01:40.855 --> 00:01:46.580
a number of traders have started their careers in the IT department of the firm.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.060
Cool. Could you say something about networking?

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.300
Which organizations or events should we attend?

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.190
My brief advice on networking is to do good work where you are,

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.065
and be a good team member there.

00:02:00.065 --> 00:02:04.670
In due course, your colleagues will be able to speak for your worth.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.400
This is true even if you are in school.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:13.535
The people who can know your work and your character are your classmates and professors.

00:02:13.535 --> 00:02:19.450
We should let go of ideas that networking is some distinct activity that you do,

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.255
and that its purpose is to get you the next job or to get someone to help you.

00:02:25.255 --> 00:02:28.820
Rather, it is about working together on things.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.025
People can see your competencies,

00:02:31.025 --> 00:02:33.085
and likewise, you can see theirs.

00:02:33.085 --> 00:02:37.985
So focus on building competence and contributing to your team.

00:02:37.985 --> 00:02:41.630
Well, some events such as job fairs consist

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.080
of people explicitly coming there looking for people to hire.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.155
There's no big trick to networking there.

00:02:48.155 --> 00:02:50.450
If you are interested in the position,

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.345
let the person know of your interests,

00:02:52.345 --> 00:02:53.995
and highlight your skills,

00:02:53.995 --> 00:02:56.480
and be able to demonstrate your competence.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.430
So you really need to have that competence first before you show up at these events.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.570
There are other networking events like meet-ups in the TechSpace, for example,

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.685
where people interested in hiring do show up sometimes.

00:03:09.685 --> 00:03:14.480
In general though, connections formed with strangers at events are weaker

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.295
than natural connections with people with whom you share a common bond already.

00:03:19.295 --> 00:03:22.130
You know them from school or work,

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.470
or volunteering together, playing on the same sports team, etc.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.890
Great. What does a typical job interview look like?

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.574
First, share your story.

00:03:33.574 --> 00:03:37.400
Really you talking about what makes you a good candidate.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.680
There are also quant problems;

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.725
logic, probability, programming, mathematics.

00:03:43.725 --> 00:03:47.085
These are intended to test your background,

00:03:47.085 --> 00:03:50.605
see how good you are on your feet with a new problem,

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:53.915
check how good your communication skills are,

00:03:53.915 --> 00:03:58.280
and also to check if you can work with someone else on a problem.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.845
The interviewer gives you a chance to ask questions to her or him.

00:04:03.845 --> 00:04:07.490
So definitely, go for it and ask them questions.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.535
It's a two-way process and you want to know if this is the group you want to work for.

00:04:12.535 --> 00:04:14.840
I also have a practical suggestion,

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.900
take an energy bar or two with you on the interview day.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.640
If for some reasons,

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.710
such as market swings on the day,

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:25.130
schedules get messed up and you miss lunch,

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.160
you'll still have your snacks and we'll be glad

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.450
you aren't doing the rest of the interviews on an empty stomach.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.555
What are some shortcomings about the current hiring process?

00:04:35.555 --> 00:04:38.255
Interviews can be too short in time.

00:04:38.255 --> 00:04:41.695
The process has been notorious for false negatives,

00:04:41.695 --> 00:04:44.465
that is, turning away good candidates.

00:04:44.465 --> 00:04:47.380
Ideally, firms would watch every junior hire over

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.510
a few months as an intern and only then higher.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.700
In fact, this is the biggest hiring pipeline for many firms on Wall Street.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.130
But that may not always be practical,

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.245
especially for small firms.

00:05:00.245 --> 00:05:02.795
Great. Thanks, Thomas, for your advice.

00:05:02.795 --> 00:05:04.560
You're welcome.
