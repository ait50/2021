Thank you for sharing this with us.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.030
It sounds like you and your team have put in

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.844
an incredible amount of effort to build this service.

00:00:07.844 --> 00:00:10.730
I'm wondering if we can use this to build apps of our own.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.310
Absolutely. At Affectiva we've made it really easy for you to incorporate

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:21.327
emotion AI into your own applications and projects through a variety of STKs and APIs.

00:00:21.327 --> 00:00:26.839
Great. This way we can include emotion recognition software in a variety of applications.

00:00:26.838 --> 00:00:29.390
Next, it will be up to our students to get some practice with

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.649
computer vision by using the software in a project of their own.
