00:00:00.349 --> 00:00:02.849
So, what is vision?

00:00:02.849 --> 00:00:04.440
At its most basic,

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.200
vision or visual perception is the act of

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.814
observing patterns and objects through sight or visual input.

00:00:10.814 --> 00:00:12.599
But vision is so much more than that.

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.839
It allows us to build a model of the physical world.

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.274
For example, take a look around you and think about what you see,

00:00:19.274 --> 00:00:22.515
maybe you see a computer screen or a mobile phone.

00:00:22.515 --> 00:00:25.710
You may also see a desk or different items in a room.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.350
When I look around the studio I see a camera in front of me,

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.649
and tables and chairs besides me.

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:31.890
We use site to learn about

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.243
our physical surroundings and where they are in relation to us.

00:00:35.243 --> 00:00:36.509
And with this information,

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:39.130
we build a physical model of our world.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.284
This is how typical human vision works,

00:00:41.283 --> 00:00:43.033
but different creatures have evolved

00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:46.379
vision systems that are tailored to their specific needs.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.625
Bees for instance have compound eyes which are many tiny eyes bundled together.

00:00:51.625 --> 00:00:53.755
Their eyes have really low resolution so they're

00:00:53.755 --> 00:00:56.259
not so great at recognizing things from a distance,

00:00:56.259 --> 00:01:00.560
but they're very sensitive to motion which is essential while flying fast.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.379
In essence, there are a variety of vision systems each with their own strengths.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.340
This is something to keep in mind when you start building and designing

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.900
systems to perform specific visual tasks in future lessons
