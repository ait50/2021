00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.410
One of the most fundamental ways we learn about

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.642
our world and environment is through our sense of sight.

00:00:07.642 --> 00:00:10.724
Our ability to see permeates our very being.

00:00:10.724 --> 00:00:14.384
It has come to define, not only how we see the physical world,

00:00:14.384 --> 00:00:17.039
but also how we see the abstract.

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.629
We speak of a company or an entrepreneur having a vision; we may say,

00:00:21.629 --> 00:00:22.829
"I see what you mean",

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:27.274
to a colleague or send on the,"I see what you did there, Jeff".

00:00:27.274 --> 00:00:29.460
Our ability to see, our vision,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.710
in a very real sense determines how we interact with the world.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.600
Computer Vision strives to give a similar ability to

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.770
a machine and if you want to build an agent that uses vision to extract,

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.493
analyze and understand useful information then you're in the right place.

00:00:45.493 --> 00:00:47.340
We have Cezanne Camacho,

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.189
a resident expert in the subject to help you learn

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:53.524
about Computer Vision and its fascinating applications.

00:00:53.524 --> 00:00:55.890
Hey everyone. I'm Cezanne and I'm excited to

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.929
guide you through some important Computer Vision topics.

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:03.164
Computer Vision is a fascinating set of techniques, inspired by mathematics,

00:01:03.164 --> 00:01:05.534
statistics and probability theory

00:01:05.534 --> 00:01:08.098
and in this lesson we'll be learning about the basics of

00:01:08.099 --> 00:01:10.814
Computer Vision and about the role it plays in

00:01:10.813 --> 00:01:14.000
artificial intelligence systems. Let's get started.
