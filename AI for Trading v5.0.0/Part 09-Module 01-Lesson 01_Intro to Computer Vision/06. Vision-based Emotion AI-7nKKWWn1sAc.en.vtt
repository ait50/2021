00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:06.213
So Rana, at Affectiva you build software that reads emotion from facial expressions.

00:00:06.214 --> 00:00:08.080
I was wondering if you could tell us a bit more about

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.929
your background and how you got involved in this work.

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:13.380
Sure. So I studied computer science as

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.605
an undergraduate at the American University in Cairo

00:00:16.605 --> 00:00:18.989
and I was really interested in how

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:22.859
computers change how we connect and communicate with one another.

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.609
And then I got an opportunity to study at Cambridge University for

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.125
my doctorate degree and that was really my first living abroad experience,

00:00:31.125 --> 00:00:36.024
and I realized I was spending more hours with my laptop than I did with any other human.

00:00:36.024 --> 00:00:40.109
Yet it was completely oblivious to my mental and emotional state.

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:41.365
So that got me thinking.

00:00:41.365 --> 00:00:45.840
What if that computer could read and respond to my emotions just the way

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.740
an awesome friend would?

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.640
I think when I think of emotional intelligence,

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.329
I don't automatically link it with artificial intelligence.

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.350
So I was also wondering if you could talk about

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.149
some current applications of this technology.

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.719
Yeah. Artificial emotional intelligence,

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.655
or what we're calling emotion AI,

00:01:02.655 --> 00:01:06.030
is the core AI and it cuts across many many industries.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.625
I'll give you two examples.

00:01:07.625 --> 00:01:08.909
One is social robots.

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.268
Social robots are expected to build a rapport with

00:01:12.269 --> 00:01:17.549
its users and understand and respond to social and emotional skills.

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.625
Autonomous vehicles is another area where emotion AI plays a really critical role.

00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:26.069
Understanding the sentiment inside

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:30.269
the car and also deciding when to relinquish control back to a driver.

00:01:30.269 --> 00:01:32.265
And is that driver paying attention?

00:01:32.265 --> 00:01:34.950
Is that driver even awake?

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.299
That's exciting to hear.

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.375
These are problems we're working on teaching at Udacity too.

00:01:39.375 --> 00:01:41.313
I have one last question for you.

00:01:41.313 --> 00:01:43.708
What kind of advice would you give to a student who

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:46.650
might be wanting to pursue a career in AI?

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.560
My advice would be, get hands-on and get building.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.000
Great. So let's keep learning.
