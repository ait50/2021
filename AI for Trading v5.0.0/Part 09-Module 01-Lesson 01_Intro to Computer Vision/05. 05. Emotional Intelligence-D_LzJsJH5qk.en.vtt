00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.089
Today I'm with Dr. Rana el Kaliouby,

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:06.580
Co-founder and CEO at Affectiva,

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.195
a company that uses computer vision to build systems that are emotionally intelligent.

00:00:11.195 --> 00:00:16.268
Rana, I've been talking to our students about the role vision plays at a basic level in

00:00:16.268 --> 00:00:19.299
AI systems by helping to recognize objects and

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.309
behavior but your work is in recognizing and responding to human emotion.

00:00:24.309 --> 00:00:27.219
What do you think makes this such important work?

00:00:27.219 --> 00:00:29.199
When we think of human intelligence,

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.170
we tend to think of cognitive intelligence or IQ,

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.179
but having emotional intelligence,

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:37.118
which is the ability to empathize and read emotions,

00:00:37.118 --> 00:00:40.060
is central to how we all interact with the world.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.725
So the question becomes,

00:00:41.725 --> 00:00:45.880
how can we build systems that are artificially emotionally intelligent?

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.570
Right. And this is the challenge we work on at Affectiva.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.359
We use computer vision and machine learning to

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:55.579
recognize emotions as they manifest on your face.

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.149
Can you tell what I'm feeling right now?

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.649
Maybe a combination of surprise,

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.280
a little bit of horror?

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.262
Yeah, definitely happy surprise.

00:01:05.262 --> 00:01:08.739
So Affectiva software can recognize emotion just like you can?

00:01:08.739 --> 00:01:12.573
Yes, by observing your facial features,

00:01:12.573 --> 00:01:15.593
so how your eyebrows and your mouth and your cheeks move.

00:01:15.593 --> 00:01:17.318
And once a computer app, you know,

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:19.504
or other application can recognize emotions,

00:01:19.504 --> 00:01:21.864
it can respond to them in real time.

00:01:21.864 --> 00:01:24.969
And this creates a lot of opportunity for improving and

00:01:24.968 --> 00:01:28.429
personalizing how we and machines interact with each other.
