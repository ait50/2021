When we think of computer vision's role in AI,

00:00:04.418 --> 00:00:08.184
we often focus on smart object and behavior recognition.

00:00:08.185 --> 00:00:10.789
We've already talked about the self-driving car example,

00:00:10.788 --> 00:00:13.640
in which computer vision is used to recognize cars and

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.574
pedestrians and also recognize their behavior,

00:00:16.574 --> 00:00:20.600
like whether they're moving fast or slow or even moving erratically.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.870
But there's a plethora of other far-reaching uses that

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.710
one wouldn't necessarily think of when talking about computer vision.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.350
It's used in state-of-the-art medical technology

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.719
to analyze medical images and identify points of interest.

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.210
An AI system can even learn to recognize cancerous tissue and help with

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.368
early detection and diagnostics by

00:00:40.368 --> 00:00:43.820
analyzing data about cancer and images of cancer cells.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.545
On a more mundane level,

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:49.335
many of us have phones that use computer vision on a daily basis.

00:00:49.335 --> 00:00:54.560
Computer vision is used to identify and categorize personal images and video.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.298
My phone recognizes me when I take

00:00:56.298 --> 00:00:59.570
a selfie and even knows that some of my friends faces look like.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.090
Some systems are smart enough to recognize

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.114
behavior and images and even caption it correctly.

00:01:05.114 --> 00:01:09.469
So, AI systems can learn to recognize a multitude of objects and

00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:14.628
behaviors using computer vision and by analyzing masses of images or video data.

00:01:14.629 --> 00:01:18.349
We've already spoken of AI systems using computer vision in

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:22.640
a similar manner to the human visual system to recognize visual surroundings,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.385
but there's another essential use that humans have for visual data.

00:01:26.385 --> 00:01:29.760
We use it to gauge the emotional state of our fellow humans.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.719
That is, vision not only let's us recognize objects,

00:01:32.718 --> 00:01:35.328
but when we're communicating with another person,

00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:38.794
we use vision to look at a person's face and body language

00:01:38.795 --> 00:01:42.430
to help us identify their mental and emotional states.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.000
As we'll see next, AI systems can learn to do this too.
