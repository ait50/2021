Some of you are probably wondering how vision fits into artificial intelligence.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.710
Why do AI systems need to see?

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.300
Why do they need vision?

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.480
Well, the basis of any AI system is that it can: one,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.519
perceive its environment and two,

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.054
take actions based on those perceptions.

00:00:18.053 --> 00:00:23.375
And as we noted previously vision is a central part of how we perceive the world.

00:00:23.375 --> 00:00:27.804
One example of an AI system we're working on Udacity is a self-driving car.

00:00:27.803 --> 00:00:30.834
The car sees the world through cameras and sensors

00:00:30.835 --> 00:00:34.640
and then uses that input to safely navigate roads by itself.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.189
Computer vision is used to analyze camera images and

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:42.085
intelligently identify objects like other cars or pedestrians.

00:00:42.085 --> 00:00:44.789
It's also used to recognize where the car is on

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.274
the road and in the world based on the car's surroundings.

00:00:48.274 --> 00:00:53.310
So, self-driving cars and many other AI systems need vision to build a physical model

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:59.000
of the world just like humans do to identify physical surroundings and respond to them.
