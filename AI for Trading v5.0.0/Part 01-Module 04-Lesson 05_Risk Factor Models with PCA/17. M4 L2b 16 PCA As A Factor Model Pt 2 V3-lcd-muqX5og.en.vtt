00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.975
The matrix that describes the coordinates of the principal components

00:00:03.975 --> 00:00:08.700
in the original basis is the matrix of factor exposures.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:16.120
The matrix of data transformed into the new language is the matrix of factor returns.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.560
How do we calculate the factor returns?

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.830
Well, we multiply the original data by the transpose of the factor exposures matrix.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.105
Remember, that for the risk model,

00:00:30.105 --> 00:00:33.524
we need to calculate the factor covariance matrix.

00:00:33.524 --> 00:00:37.670
How do we do that? Well, we have the matrix of factors.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:44.250
We just calculate their covariance the same way we always calculate a covariance matrix.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.710
Remember that since the factors are projections of the data onto the PCs,

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.795
the factors are orthogonal,

00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:56.995
just as the principal components are orthogonal.

00:00:56.995 --> 00:01:01.550
This means that the factor covariance matrix is a diagonal matrix.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.440
This is true for PCA,

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.860
but not necessarily true for other types of factor models.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.670
Finally, remember that the factors are returns time series.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.765
They don't necessarily have direct interpretations in the physical world,

00:01:17.765 --> 00:01:21.660
but you can think of them as returns time series for

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.580
some latent or unknown driver of return variance.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.805
If the returns time series are daily returns,

00:01:29.805 --> 00:01:32.115
then when we calculate their variances,

00:01:32.115 --> 00:01:37.099
we have estimates of the factor returns variances on a daily basis.

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:43.535
Typically, we annualize these by multiplying the whole matrix by an annualization factor.

00:01:43.535 --> 00:01:47.540
Remember, we don't need the square root of the factor because

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.985
our numbers here are variances, not standard deviations.

00:01:51.985 --> 00:01:54.920
So if we were going from daily to annualized,

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.230
we'd multiply by 252.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:06.190
Lastly, we need to calculate the idiosyncratic or specific risk matrix.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.040
We know that what's leftover from our model is

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.690
the original returns data minus the part we represent with the PCs.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.535
To calculate the specific risk matrix,

00:02:18.535 --> 00:02:22.405
we calculate the covariance matrix of the residuals,

00:02:22.405 --> 00:02:25.640
and set the off-diagonal elements to zero.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.960
Since we set the off-diagonal elements to zero,

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.680
we now do not have a perfect re-creation of the covariance matrix of the original data.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.950
But this is reasonable because we try to capture as much of the correlation

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.970
in the data as possible with the principal components that we decided to keep.
