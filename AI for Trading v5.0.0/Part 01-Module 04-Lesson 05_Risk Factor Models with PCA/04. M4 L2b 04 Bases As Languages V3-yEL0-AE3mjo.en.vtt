00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
PCA, amounts to finding a new and special basis for your dataset.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.199
But hang on, what does it mean to find a new basis?

00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:13.199
I'm guessing that you've heard about and even done this yourself before.

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:17.660
But before we move on, let's just briefly review exactly what this means.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.675
Let's return to thinking about vectors as directions in space,

00:00:21.675 --> 00:00:23.875
and start in the 2D plane.

00:00:23.875 --> 00:00:28.750
You know that we can represent a point living in the 2D plane with two coordinates.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.240
The coordinates tell you how to get to the point from the origin.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.690
For example, the vector 1,2 means go one unit to the right,

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:40.109
and two up to get to this point.

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:42.964
So, we see that we can decompose

00:00:42.965 --> 00:00:47.385
the overall movement represented by the vector into two movements;

00:00:47.384 --> 00:00:49.464
one to the right, and one up.

00:00:49.465 --> 00:00:51.910
Once we know the directions to go,

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:55.489
we can specify how far to go in each direction.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.855
Towards this goal, let's write down two vectors,

00:00:58.854 --> 00:01:00.639
i hat and j hat.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.439
The first one, we write as 1,0 which means move one unit to the right.

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:12.295
The second one, we write as 0,1 which represents moving one unit up.

00:01:12.295 --> 00:01:17.865
Our original vector is made up of one i hat and two j hats.

00:01:17.864 --> 00:01:25.969
We can write it as 1 times 1,0 plus 2 times 0,1 or 1,2.

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:31.929
In other words, our vector can be written as a linear combination of i hat and j hat.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.200
We call i hat and j hat a set of basis vectors for the 2D plane.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.939
A set of vectors is a basis for a space,

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:46.584
if no vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of the others,

00:01:46.584 --> 00:01:53.459
and any vector in the space can be written as a linear combination of vectors in the set.

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:57.684
If we want to express this using matrix multiplication,

00:01:57.685 --> 00:01:59.329
we could write it this way.

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:05.329
Now, we see that the number in the top position of this vector means how much of i hat,

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.120
or how much of the first basis vector.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:13.705
While the number in this bottom position means how much of the second basis vector.

00:02:13.705 --> 00:02:19.880
So, 1,2 is how we write our vector in the i hat, j hat basis.

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:23.579
Although we use i hat and j hat most of the time,

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.620
there are other bases we can choose for the 2D plane,

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.060
because there are different ways to get to our point.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.789
We could shoot out over here,

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:32.650
and then go back over here.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.520
Remember, that our choice of basis also effectively

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.689
sets up a coordinate grid for us to represent our vectors in.

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:44.359
We are used to seeing a grid made up of square boxes,

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.500
the usual X, Y coordinate system,

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.955
with the basis vectors i hat and j hat.

00:02:48.955 --> 00:02:53.590
But if we use these red and blue vectors as our basis vectors,

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.580
a more sensible grid would be made up of these parallelograms.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.330
Thus, we can represent our original vector with a different combination of basis vectors.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.840
We can think of this as another language for writing down our original vector,

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.390
because we see that we can write down a new set of

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:14.554
instructions for creating the original vector.

00:03:14.555 --> 00:03:18.870
Now, all we need is a way to translate between the two languages,

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.474
the original language, where we use i hat j hat,

00:03:21.474 --> 00:03:24.530
and this one with the blue and red vectors.
