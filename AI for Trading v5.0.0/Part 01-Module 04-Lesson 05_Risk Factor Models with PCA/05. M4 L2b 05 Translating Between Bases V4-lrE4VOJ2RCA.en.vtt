00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.495
Let's take a close look at these red and blue vectors.

00:00:03.495 --> 00:00:08.460
In fact, let's try looking at them in the original i hat j hat basis.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.285
In the original basis,

00:00:10.285 --> 00:00:13.220
the first vector can be written (1,0.5).

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.135
That is to say it can be created with one i hat and a half a j hat.

00:00:18.135 --> 00:00:24.910
The second vector is (-1,1) so it can be created with minus one i hat and one j hat.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.690
Here, we've learned how to write the vectors of

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.420
the new basis in the language of the old basis.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.120
So, we effectively know how to translate between them.

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:38.159
Now, let's see how we can use this information to take a vector expressed

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:42.449
in one basis and find out how to express it in another basis.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.070
We know that we need two copies of the blue vector and

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.384
one of the red vector to represent our original vector,

00:00:49.384 --> 00:00:51.309
let's write that down.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.105
When we multiply it out,

00:00:53.104 --> 00:00:56.299
we see that we recover our vector as written in the i hat,

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:59.899
j hat basis, which makes sense since we know that

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.804
these vectors are also written in the i hat j hat basis.

00:01:03.804 --> 00:01:08.444
So, now we can see how translation between the two languages works.

00:01:08.444 --> 00:01:13.264
We need to write the new basis vectors in the language of the old basis,

00:01:13.265 --> 00:01:16.849
then the formula for building the vector in the language of

00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:21.693
the new basis gives us our vector in the language of the old basis.

00:01:21.694 --> 00:01:27.049
Conversely, if we were starting with (1,2) in our original language of i hat,

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.890
j hat and we wanted to translate to this new basis,

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.879
we'd have to find out how to write i hat and j hat in the new basis.

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:37.834
Then, we'd multiply it by that matrix

00:01:37.834 --> 00:01:42.149
and outward pop our original vector in the new basis.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.430
It turns out that the matrix that tells you how to translate

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.745
from the language of the old basis to the language of the new basis

00:01:49.745 --> 00:01:52.820
is just the inverse of the matrix that tells you how to

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:56.854
translate from the language of the new basis to the language of the old basis.

00:01:56.855 --> 00:02:01.100
This makes sense because translating from the old basis to the new basis and

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:06.294
back should have the effect of doing nothing and give you back what you started with.

00:02:06.295 --> 00:02:09.960
I'll let you verify this for yourself.
