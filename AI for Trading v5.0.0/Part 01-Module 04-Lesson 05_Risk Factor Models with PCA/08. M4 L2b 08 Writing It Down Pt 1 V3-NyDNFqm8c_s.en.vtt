00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
Okay. So, what I told you is that we want to

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.685
maximize the variance of the data in the new basis direction.

00:00:06.684 --> 00:00:10.259
Now I want to show you exactly how what I showed you

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:14.035
in pictures translates into symbols that we write down.

00:00:14.035 --> 00:00:17.045
I don't think this is as essential for you to know,

00:00:17.045 --> 00:00:19.429
because you already have the core idea.

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:21.094
But I want to show this to you,

00:00:21.094 --> 00:00:24.419
so that if you read about PCA in books or online,

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.225
you'll be able to follow what's written,

00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:29.340
and because for myself I like to go through these things

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:33.365
step-by-step to make sure I really understand exactly what's going on.

00:00:33.365 --> 00:00:35.820
I think this is important for being able to make

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.215
inferences about the results of mathematical calculations,

00:00:39.215 --> 00:00:43.305
and for being able to compare among techniques that do similar things.

00:00:43.304 --> 00:00:46.340
I want to be able to afford to you the opportunity to

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.220
understand on a deep level to. So, let's get started.

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.519
What we're going to do here is go through what we already described in a bit more detail,

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.085
in a bit more rigorously.

00:00:57.085 --> 00:01:00.054
So, let's start with something I left out earlier.

00:01:00.054 --> 00:01:03.979
The very first thing we need to do when we do PCA is make

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:08.454
sure the data are centered around zero. What do we mean by that?

00:01:08.454 --> 00:01:13.620
Let's say the dataset we started with was over here in the 2D plane.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.605
The coordinates of this point are a and b.

00:01:17.605 --> 00:01:21.695
Here's the mean of all the points x coordinates,

00:01:21.694 --> 00:01:25.609
and here's the mean of all the ports y coordinates.

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:27.745
When we begin PCA,

00:01:27.745 --> 00:01:29.859
if these means are non-zero,

00:01:29.858 --> 00:01:31.834
we want to subtract the mean in

00:01:31.834 --> 00:01:36.099
each dimension so that we get a new dataset centered around zero.

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:40.125
First, we subtract the x mean from each data point.

00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:43.834
Then we subtract the y mean from each data point.

00:01:43.834 --> 00:01:46.544
Now the points are centered around zero,.

00:01:46.545 --> 00:01:51.269
This is called mean centering or mean normalizing the data.
