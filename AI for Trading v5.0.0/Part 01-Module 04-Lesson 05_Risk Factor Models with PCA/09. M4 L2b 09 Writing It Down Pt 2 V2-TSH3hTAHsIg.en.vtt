00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.365
Now for simplicity, let's look at just one of these mean centered data points.

00:00:05.365 --> 00:00:08.640
We're looking for a new basis for the data and we want to

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.464
write down the coordinates of this point in a new basis.

00:00:12.464 --> 00:00:15.379
This is the same thing we discussed earlier,

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.769
we are looking for two new basis vectors for the 2D plane

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:25.164
which give us an alternate way of describing our original points location.

00:00:25.164 --> 00:00:30.294
Okay. Let's say we've run PCA and it has spit out the new basis directions,

00:00:30.295 --> 00:00:35.170
these are called Principal Components PCs or just components.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:41.465
They are the directions of the new basis as written in the language of the old basis.

00:00:41.465 --> 00:00:44.720
It's required by the algorithm that these have

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.534
length 1 and be perpendicular to each other.

00:00:47.534 --> 00:00:50.074
So, let's show them slightly smaller.

00:00:50.075 --> 00:00:53.440
We'll consider them to be length 1 now.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.685
Now, let's find our points' coordinates in the new basis.

00:00:58.685 --> 00:01:01.484
Let's do one coordinate at a time.

00:01:01.484 --> 00:01:03.994
We'll start with the red basis vector.

00:01:03.994 --> 00:01:06.094
Let's write down some names,

00:01:06.094 --> 00:01:10.140
let's call the vector pointing to our original data point X and

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.670
the red basis vector W. Notice that what we've formed here is a right triangle.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.469
If X is the length of the X vector and Theta is the angle

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:26.459
between the X vector and the W vector and you remember your trigonometry,

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:31.079
you'll see that this distance is X cosine Theta.

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.405
Now, let's remember the formula for the dot product.

00:01:35.405 --> 00:01:39.159
X.W is the length of X times the length of

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.244
W times the cosine of the angle between them, Theta.

00:01:43.245 --> 00:01:48.030
So this length equals X.W divided by the length of

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:55.480
W. This quantity is the projection of our original point onto the new basis direction,

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.275
and it turns out it's exactly the quantity we're looking to maximize

00:02:00.275 --> 00:02:05.545
over all the data points when we pick our new basis direction.

00:02:05.545 --> 00:02:08.860
In fact, when I say maximize the variance,

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.580
I actually mean that if we have all these dot products

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.900
for all the X vectors pointing to each of our data points,

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.400
we want the variance of this new set of numbers to be as large as possible.
