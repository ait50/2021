00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.815
Variance, okay we know the formula for that.

00:00:03.815 --> 00:00:07.365
It's just the sum of the squared deviations from the mean,

00:00:07.365 --> 00:00:09.515
divided by n minus one.

00:00:09.515 --> 00:00:13.745
But if the mean of the original data coordinates is zero,

00:00:13.744 --> 00:00:18.204
so is the mean of their projections onto the new direction.

00:00:18.204 --> 00:00:22.879
So, we have that this term I call mu is zero.

00:00:22.879 --> 00:00:26.079
So, we're trying to maximize this thing.

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:30.149
Now, I'm going to show you how to write this in a more condensed fashion,

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:33.269
that you will see if you're reading about PCA.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.270
First, let's notice that if each of these quantities is a number and a vector,

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.950
the variance above is just the squared length of the vector.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.984
Now let's look at the thing inside the double bars.

00:00:46.984 --> 00:00:48.744
If you don't follow this step,

00:00:48.744 --> 00:00:52.000
try writing it down for yourself and multiplying it out.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.670
But see that we can write this as a matrix where x_1 is the first row,

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.439
x_2 is the second row and x_3 is the third row times the w vector.

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:06.590
Remember that this w is just the length of the w vector,

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.030
so it's just a number.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.465
I'll just pull it out over here.

00:01:10.465 --> 00:01:14.380
Now, let's write this in a more condensed form.

00:01:14.379 --> 00:01:17.030
See that the matrix on the left is

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.245
just our data matrix where the rows are the observations,

00:01:21.245 --> 00:01:23.990
so the number of rows is the number of data points

00:01:23.989 --> 00:01:27.295
and the columns are the features or dimensions.

00:01:27.295 --> 00:01:31.129
The vector on the right is just our w vector.

00:01:31.129 --> 00:01:35.994
Another way you might see this written is like this.

00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:41.570
Be sure to go through these steps on your own if you find you're a little fuzzy on them.

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:44.714
But now we've arrived at where we wanted to.

00:01:44.715 --> 00:01:48.034
This last quantity is called a Rayleigh quotient.

00:01:48.034 --> 00:01:51.854
This is exactly the quantity we try to maximize in PCA,

00:01:51.855 --> 00:01:53.424
when we're looking for w;

00:01:53.424 --> 00:01:56.530
the direction of the first dimension.
