00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.469
Let's summarize.

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:07.109
What I'm trying to tell you is that the goal of maximizing these links,

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:12.330
the projections of our data onto the first dimension can be written this way,

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.019
where this thing in here is the variance of this set of

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:20.074
projections of the X vectors onto the W direction,

00:00:20.074 --> 00:00:22.445
up to a constant factor.

00:00:22.445 --> 00:00:27.740
Then, we choose W so as to maximize that variance.

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:31.464
This is how we choose the first principle component,

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:34.939
what we would do to find the next principle component is,

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:37.144
subtract the component of

00:00:37.145 --> 00:00:42.095
each data vector in the direction of the first principle component.

00:00:42.094 --> 00:00:45.975
Remember that when you subtract a vector from another vector,

00:00:45.975 --> 00:00:50.875
you line up the first vector's tail with a second vector's tip.

00:00:50.875 --> 00:00:55.189
Then, we'd get a new set of data vectors that live

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:59.344
in the space orthogonal to the first principle component.

00:00:59.344 --> 00:01:01.179
In our example here,

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:06.894
this new space is only a straight line orthogonal to the first principle component.

00:01:06.894 --> 00:01:09.674
If we were working in three-dimensions,

00:01:09.674 --> 00:01:13.545
and we found the direction of the first principal component,

00:01:13.545 --> 00:01:18.474
we'd find the component of each data point along that direction,

00:01:18.474 --> 00:01:22.084
and subtract that from the data point.

00:01:22.084 --> 00:01:25.489
These new data vectors would all live in

00:01:25.489 --> 00:01:29.810
the 2D plane perpendicular to the first principle component.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.500
Then we'd apply the same procedure to find the next principle component,

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.799
until we had one for each dimension.
