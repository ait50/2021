00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.830
Okay, we're doing math now,

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.955
so let's start with something super simple; a vector.

00:00:04.955 --> 00:00:06.669
Oh my gosh you're thinking,

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:09.839
a vector dah, I've seen this a million times.

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:12.240
Well, I just want to remind you that there are

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.118
a couple of different ways of thinking about a vector,

00:00:15.118 --> 00:00:18.925
that we will transition between when discussing analysis methods.

00:00:18.925 --> 00:00:21.929
First, a vector is a collection of numbers,

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:25.019
as in you might make a bunch of measurements and put them into

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.714
a column in a spreadsheet application and think of that as a vector.

00:00:28.714 --> 00:00:31.259
For example, you could think of the returns of

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.690
several companies stocks on the same day as a vector.

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:36.829
But the other way to think of a vector,

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:38.879
which you may also be familiar with,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.615
is as a direction in space.

00:00:40.615 --> 00:00:44.090
Remember like a 3 D vector is also an arrow

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.965
pointing from the origin to a point in 3 D space.

00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:52.320
These are both valid views and we'll need both to get to where we're going.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.619
I want you to be comfortable with the idea that

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:56.884
we'll need to switch back and forth between them,

00:00:56.884 --> 00:00:59.409
as we move through this content.
