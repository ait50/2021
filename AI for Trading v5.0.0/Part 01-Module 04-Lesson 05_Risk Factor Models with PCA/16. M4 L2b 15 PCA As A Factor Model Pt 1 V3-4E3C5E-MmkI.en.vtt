00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.690
So, let's return to the main subject of this lesson,

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.275
which is factor models of risk.

00:00:06.275 --> 00:00:10.914
So, how do we use PCA to create a factor model of risk?

00:00:10.914 --> 00:00:13.094
What are our data?

00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:17.830
They are a set of time series of stock returns for many, many companies.

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:23.264
Our main motivations for using PCA are to reduce the dimensionality of these data

00:00:23.265 --> 00:00:29.304
and also find a representation of them that captures a maximum amount of their variance.

00:00:29.304 --> 00:00:33.630
We'll use this representation or model of risk later when

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.160
we seek to minimize risk as part of an optimization problem.

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:41.839
We're going to be talking about a lot of matrix multiplications here,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.255
so I'm going to try to always write down the dimensions.

00:00:45.255 --> 00:00:49.545
I think keeping track of the dimensions will help you keep track of what's going on.

00:00:49.545 --> 00:00:51.365
It's certainly helps me.

00:00:51.365 --> 00:00:54.204
When we use a factor model, remember,

00:00:54.204 --> 00:00:58.494
we have a representation of the returns that looks like this.

00:00:58.494 --> 00:01:02.604
In order to produce a factor model of risk using PCA,

00:01:02.604 --> 00:01:05.450
we need to look at what the PCA algorithm gives

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.810
us and map its outputs to each of these matrices;

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.290
the factor exposures, factor returns,

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.830
and the idiosyncratic risk matrix.

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:19.484
So, let's look at what these symbols represent in terms of matrices.

00:01:19.484 --> 00:01:25.754
The returns matrix has dimensions of number of companies by number of time points.

00:01:25.754 --> 00:01:29.414
The matrix of factor exposures has dimensions,

00:01:29.415 --> 00:01:32.750
number of companies by number of factors.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.230
The matrix of factor returns has dimensions

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.790
of number of factors by number of time points.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.250
Finally, the matrix of specific risk has

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.420
dimensions number of companies by number of time points.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.224
Let's take a look at what we get from running the PCA algorithm.

00:01:52.224 --> 00:01:56.750
Remember that PCA finds a new basis for the data.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.079
If we keep all the PCs,

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.679
then multiplying the representation of the data in the PC language by

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.409
the matrix of PCs completely recreates the data in the original basis.

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:14.120
On the other hand, if we drop some of the PCs then multiplying

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.990
the data matrix in the new basis by the matrix of PCs almost recreates the data.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.365
This is the compressed representation of the data.

00:02:23.365 --> 00:02:25.330
If we add in what's leftover,

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.705
then we have a complete representation of the data.

00:02:28.705 --> 00:02:31.820
Now, this is looking a lot like

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.284
the factor representation we discussed a little bit earlier.

00:02:35.284 --> 00:02:40.000
In fact, we're just going to use this as our factor model.
