00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
Okay. Let's get back to what we really want to talk about, PCA.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.380
In a nutshell, what is PCA?

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.705
PCA is a series of calculations that gives us a new and special basis for our data.

00:00:13.705 --> 00:00:15.275
Why is it special?

00:00:15.275 --> 00:00:17.795
Well, the first dimension is the dimension

00:00:17.795 --> 00:00:20.750
along which the data points are the most spread out,

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.609
we say they have the most variance along this dimension.

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:27.089
What do we mean exactly?

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:31.339
We mean that, if we start with a dataset and we consider

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:36.325
a new axis in the 2D plane represented by this line through the origin,

00:00:36.325 --> 00:00:40.820
then we find the coordinates of our points along this new axis

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.259
by projecting them by the shortest path to the new axis.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:54.130
Consider the variance or spread of this set of coordinates along the line.

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.820
When we do PCA or trying to choose our new axis in

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.549
such a way that the new coordinates are as spread

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:08.194
out as possible or have maximum variance,

00:01:08.194 --> 00:01:10.750
it turns out that the choice of line,

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.099
where the coordinates are most spread out,

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:16.219
is also the choice of line that minimizes

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:20.019
the perpendicular distance of each coordinate to the line.

00:01:20.019 --> 00:01:25.155
We say that the basis minimizes reconstruction error.

00:01:25.155 --> 00:01:30.105
Maximizing variance and minimizing reconstruction error go hand in hand.

00:01:30.105 --> 00:01:34.195
The squared distance from the origin to the projection,

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:37.949
plus the squared distance from the projection to the point,

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.719
equals the squared distance from the origin to the point,

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:44.474
this is just the Pythagorean theorem.

00:01:44.474 --> 00:01:47.719
So, when you change the orientation of the line,

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:50.799
if one increases the other must decrease.

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.039
The orientation of the line chosen by PCA is the one that

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.075
maximizes the squared distances along the line

00:01:59.075 --> 00:02:03.140
for all points and simultaneously minimizes

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.909
the squared perpendicular distances to the line for all points.

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.305
This is how we find the first basis direction.

00:02:12.305 --> 00:02:17.770
The next basis direction must be perpendicular or orthogonal to the first.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.429
In our little example,

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:21.890
there is only one choice for this dimension,

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:24.989
because we are working in a two-dimensional space.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.510
But if we were working in a higher-dimensional space,

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:32.449
the requirement for the next basis direction would be that it be

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:36.319
orthogonal to the first and also maximize

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.590
the variance of the points along that dimension and so

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.985
on until we have as many new dimensions as we had dimensions to start with.

00:02:45.985 --> 00:02:48.620
So, if we had data in four dimensions,

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.530
PCA would give us four new axes.
