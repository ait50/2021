00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.570
Great. So, we found this new and special set of basis vectors,

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.634
which are the principal components.

00:00:06.634 --> 00:00:10.300
What now? Well, let's look at what we have.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.355
We have these new basis dimensions.

00:00:13.355 --> 00:00:15.620
What are the significance of these?

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:16.984
How do we interpret them?

00:00:16.984 --> 00:00:18.655
What do they represent?

00:00:18.655 --> 00:00:23.089
Well, we've been talking about vectors in geometric space so far.

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:27.089
So, we picture the principal components as directions in space,

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:28.859
and they are that.

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.160
But when we have a data table,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.009
the dimensions have another meaning as well.

00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:37.629
Each dimension represents a feature in a dataset,

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.375
one type of measurement.

00:00:39.375 --> 00:00:42.590
For example, if we're talking about stock returns,

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.420
each dimension represents the returns of an individual company.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.030
The new basis dimensions,

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.719
the PCs, are combinations of the original dimensions.

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.159
Therefore, they have funny units,

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:03.019
some amount of returns of company A plus some other amount of returns of company B.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.810
These new units may or may not

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.704
correspond to any quantity that makes sense in the real world.

00:01:09.704 --> 00:01:13.355
We say they may or may not be interpretable.

00:01:13.355 --> 00:01:17.120
Whether or not we think the new basis dimensions represent

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.969
some real-world quantity and whether or not we

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:24.000
care depends on the problem we're trying to solve.
