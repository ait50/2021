00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.875
You now have gained some intuition for how the Central Limit Theorem works.

00:00:05.875 --> 00:00:09.214
But it doesn't work for all sampling distributions.

00:00:09.214 --> 00:00:14.785
Sure, a mean and proportion are normally distributed with large enough sample sizes.

00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:17.699
But what does it mean for a sample size to be large enough?

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.214
Is a sample size of 10 large enough?

00:00:20.214 --> 00:00:23.160
Or 30? Or 100?

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.759
You might memorize a list of statistics for which the Central Limit Theorem applies.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.755
It applies for the mean, and for proportions,

00:00:31.754 --> 00:00:33.935
and applies for the difference in means,

00:00:33.935 --> 00:00:35.925
and difference in proportions.

00:00:35.924 --> 00:00:37.699
However, the Central Limit Theorem doesn't

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.175
apply to the sampling distribution for the variance,

00:00:40.174 --> 00:00:42.539
or for the correlation coefficient.

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:46.329
It doesn't apply for the sampling distribution of the maximum value in a data set.

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.929
With all the data being collected in the world,

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:52.280
and tons of compute power available at our fingertips,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.524
the Central Limit Theorem is still useful for some sampling distributions.

00:00:56.524 --> 00:00:58.640
But instead of relying on this theorem,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.210
what if we just simulated whatever sampling distribution we were interested in instead?
