00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.384
You now have seen how a sampling distribution provides how a statistic varies.

00:00:08.384 --> 00:00:12.309
As we saw, the proportions change with different samples of students.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.914
However, we might also look at the distribution of other statistics,

00:00:16.914 --> 00:00:20.169
like how the sample standard deviation, the variance,

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.570
difference in mean or any other statistic varies from one sample to the next.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.335
Notice, we are not looking at the distribution parameters.

00:00:29.335 --> 00:00:31.394
As you saw in the first example,

00:00:31.394 --> 00:00:36.485
the parameter that is a numeric summary of a population is a fixed value,

00:00:36.485 --> 00:00:38.570
so these values do not change.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.719
However, statistics will change based on a sample you select from the population.

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:46.750
So what are the common traits of sampling distributions??
