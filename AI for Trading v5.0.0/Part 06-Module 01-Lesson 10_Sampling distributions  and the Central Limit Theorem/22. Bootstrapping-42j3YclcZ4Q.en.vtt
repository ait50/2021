00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.274
So in the last video,

00:00:02.274 --> 00:00:05.094
we talked about how relying on mathematical theorems,

00:00:05.094 --> 00:00:07.359
like the central limit theorem leads to

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.560
gaps in whether we've achieved a large enough sample size or,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.185
which statistics the theorem applies to,

00:00:14.185 --> 00:00:19.359
and that instead of relying on theorems we could simulate the sampling distribution.

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.210
This introduces a technique known as bootstrapping.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.800
Bootstrapping in statistics, means sampling with replacement.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.370
If we want to bootstrap sample five individuals from this group,

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.329
we could randomly sample these five here.

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.570
However, in bootstrap sampling,

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.750
we are sampling with replacement.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.710
So we could actually end up sampling these four,

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.990
and this one might end up being sampled again.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.774
We could look at this a bit slower.

00:00:45.774 --> 00:00:49.420
In sampling, we might end up choosing this individual.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.285
And immediately after choosing it as a part of the sample,

00:00:52.284 --> 00:00:55.589
it goes back to potentially be chosen again.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.115
It is possible, though unlikely,

00:00:58.115 --> 00:01:03.745
in bootstrap sampling to choose the same individual for every random draw.

00:01:03.744 --> 00:01:09.280
We could end up choosing this individual or any of these five times in a row.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.534
After a little more practice with this,

00:01:11.534 --> 00:01:15.500
you'll be ready to apply bootstrapping to simulate sampling distributions.
