00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.865
It's important to understand notation.

00:00:02.865 --> 00:00:04.661
You might not even know it,

00:00:04.661 --> 00:00:07.439
but you use notation all the time.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.782
Consider this example of five plus three.

00:00:10.782 --> 00:00:12.984
Plus is an English word.

00:00:12.984 --> 00:00:17.219
This symbol is notation, and it's universal.

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:21.699
Notation is a common math language used to communicate.

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:25.905
Regardless of whether you speak English, Spanish, Greek,

00:00:25.905 --> 00:00:27.510
or any other language,

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.910
you can work together using notation as a common language to solve problems.

00:00:32.909 --> 00:00:34.899
Like learning any new language,

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:36.854
notation can be frightening at first.

00:00:36.854 --> 00:00:42.039
But it's an essential tool for communicating ideas associated with data.

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:47.399
We will work together through some examples to assure you completely master this concept.
