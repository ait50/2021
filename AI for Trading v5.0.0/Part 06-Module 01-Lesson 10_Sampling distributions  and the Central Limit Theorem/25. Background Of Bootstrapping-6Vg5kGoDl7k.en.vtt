If bootstrap sampling seems pretty amazing,

00:00:05.884 --> 00:00:07.475
that's because it kind of is.

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:12.664
But the application of bootstrap sampling actually goes beyond even the use cases here.

00:00:12.664 --> 00:00:17.024
Bootstrapping techniques have been used for leading machine learning algorithms.

00:00:17.024 --> 00:00:20.224
More on this as provided in the instructor notes below.

00:00:20.225 --> 00:00:24.285
This technique is credited to Bradley Efron in 1979,

00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:26.638
a Minnesota born statistician.

00:00:26.638 --> 00:00:29.690
The name bootstrapping was given to the technique

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.350
because of the amazement and how well it works is similar to

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.829
the idea of being able to walk into quicksand and pull

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.644
yourself out of the quicksand to safety by your own bootstraps.

00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:45.410
The way we can draw inference about a population parameter by only

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:50.364
performing repeated sampling within our existing sample is just as amazing.

00:00:50.365 --> 00:00:53.929
We actually gain confidence about where parameter is likely

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:58.189
to exist without having to collect any additional data.

00:00:58.189 --> 00:01:02.000
This is an amazing concept and it's wowed people for years.
