00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:07.429
So you probably notice that though our sample is still five students,

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:09.969
our statistic changed, because we chose

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.380
five different students than were chosen in the first sample.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.425
We could select all possible combinations of five cups,

00:00:17.425 --> 00:00:22.774
and we could recompute the proportion of coffee drinkers for each of these samples.

00:00:22.774 --> 00:00:28.269
If we were to look at how these statistics change from one sample to the next, that is,

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:34.240
if we looked at the distribution of the proportions across all samples of size five,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.539
this is what is known as the sampling distribution.
