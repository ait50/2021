00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.216
In this video, we'll be defining the term Sampling Distribution,

00:00:07.216 --> 00:00:11.440
and looking at an example of one specific sampling distribution.

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:15.894
A sampling distribution is the distribution of a statistic.

00:00:15.894 --> 00:00:17.739
This could be any statistic,

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:19.349
but what does it really mean,

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.225
to look at the distribution of a statistic?

00:00:22.225 --> 00:00:26.480
Consider again the coffee drinking habits of all Udacity students.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.786
Let's say, each of these cups represents a student,

00:00:29.786 --> 00:00:33.600
and a green cup represents a student that drinks coffee,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.905
while a red cup represents a student that doesn't drink coffee.

00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:42.120
And even though there are more students than we represent here,

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:45.449
pretend that this represents all Udacity students.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.910
If we were to select this group of students to ask about their coffee drinking habits,

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:52.469
what would our population,

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.479
parameter, sample and statistic be?

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:58.084
Use the quiz below to answer.

00:00:58.085 --> 00:01:02.000
