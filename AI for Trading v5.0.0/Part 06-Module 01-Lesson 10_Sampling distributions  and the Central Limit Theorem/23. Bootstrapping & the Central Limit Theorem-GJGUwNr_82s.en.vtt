00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.280
Here's the idea of using bootstrapping to

00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:06.504
simulate the sampling distribution for any statistic.

00:00:06.504 --> 00:00:11.324
This might take more than one time through to fully grasp. So bear with me.

00:00:11.324 --> 00:00:13.689
We know that in inferential statistics,

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:16.059
we want to use a statistic to try and say

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.379
something about the corresponding population parameter.

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:23.899
Imagine we treat our sample as if it were the entire population.

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:28.794
So although these 21 cups represent only a sample of Udacity students,

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:33.125
imagine we treat them as though they were in our entire population.

00:00:33.125 --> 00:00:37.734
If these 21 individuals are truly representative of our population,

00:00:37.734 --> 00:00:40.929
we can bootstrap sample from them to understand how

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:45.274
the proportion of coffee drinkers might change from one sample to the next.

00:00:45.274 --> 00:00:48.399
Here, I set up an array of 21 ones and

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.329
zeroes to represent the cups and the previous image.

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:53.714
I also set the seed,

00:00:53.715 --> 00:00:56.800
in case you want to follow along and get the same results.

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:01.159
We can calculate the proportion of coffee drinkers in our original sample.

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:04.629
Now, let's take our first bootstrap sample of

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.129
the same size as the original sample and calculate the proportion of coffee drinkers.

00:01:10.129 --> 00:01:13.780
Notice, this proportion doesn't match the original because we're

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.439
not just sampling the original observations again but rather,

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:20.319
we're sampling them with replacement.

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:22.144
We could write a loop to reform

00:01:22.144 --> 00:01:27.564
the same sampling 10,000 times to see how the proportion will change.

00:01:27.564 --> 00:01:31.584
Finally, let's plot the proportions to look at the sampling distribution.

00:01:31.584 --> 00:01:36.129
Use your sampling distribution results to answer the questions in the next concept.
