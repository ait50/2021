00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.870
There are two mathematical theorems that are

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.964
commonly discussed when looking at sampling distributions,

00:00:08.964 --> 00:00:12.169
the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem.

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:15.182
First, let's go through the Law of Large Numbers.

00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:18.379
This theorem makes a lot of sense and it tells us that if

00:00:18.379 --> 00:00:21.964
we choose the right statistics to estimate a parameter,

00:00:21.964 --> 00:00:23.824
the larger our sample size,

00:00:23.824 --> 00:00:26.669
the closer the statistic gets to the parameter.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.430
Makes a lot of sense, right?

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.155
If you want to know the mean of a population and you estimate it with the sample mean,

00:00:33.155 --> 00:00:35.105
the larger the sample size,

00:00:35.104 --> 00:00:37.369
the better your sample mean will be,

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:39.599
estimating the population mean.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.925
So you might be wondering,

00:00:40.924 --> 00:00:44.869
what makes a statistic the right estimate of a parameter?

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:47.524
There are a number of ways to estimate parameters.

00:00:47.524 --> 00:00:49.339
In the instructor notes below,

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.000
I've provided links to some of the most popular methods.
