00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:07.540
In this lesson, you've looked a lot at sampling distributions.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.339
We might still not understand the use of this idea in practice.

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:12.919
In the next lessons,

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:14.884
you're going to learn more about inference.

00:00:14.884 --> 00:00:19.234
Specifically, you'll be learning about Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing.

00:00:19.234 --> 00:00:21.407
When looking at these techniques online,

00:00:21.407 --> 00:00:23.149
you might find a lot of formulas and

00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:26.959
built-in calculators for computing the final results for these techniques.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.850
However, these built-in calculators hide the assumptions and potential biases.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.329
With your new understanding of sampling distributions and bootstrapping,

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.899
you're ready to tackle not only using the built-in techniques,

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.320
but to extend these techniques to a multitude of other situations.
