00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.469
The second theorem is one of the most popular theorems in all of statistics.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.605
And it pertains specifically to the sample mean and sample proportions statistics.

00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:15.384
The central limit theorem states,

00:00:15.384 --> 00:00:17.469
that with a large enough sample size,

00:00:17.469 --> 00:00:21.684
the sampling distribution of the mean will be normally distributed,

00:00:21.684 --> 00:00:26.308
since a proportion is like a mean of zero and one data values,

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:28.780
it also abides by the central limit theorem.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.920
To give you some practice with this,

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.000
work through the notebook and quiz questions that follow.
