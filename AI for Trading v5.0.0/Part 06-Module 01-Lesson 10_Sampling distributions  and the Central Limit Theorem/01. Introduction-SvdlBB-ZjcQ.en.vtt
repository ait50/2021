00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.030
In this lesson, you'll be learning about sampling distributions.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.900
In order to gain a firm grasp of how sampling distributions work,

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.425
it's important to first have a strong grasp of inferential statistics.

00:00:12.425 --> 00:00:15.450
We will do a recap in the next concepts to make sure

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:19.230
you're comfortable with the ideas surrounding inferential statistics.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.914
This is also a shift from earlier content,

00:00:21.914 --> 00:00:24.599
where you were thinking of probability functions.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.965
From this point, you'll be thinking more about statistics.

00:00:27.964 --> 00:00:31.530
That is, we'll be learning from data to draw our conclusions,

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.390
rather than using probability to draw our conclusions.
