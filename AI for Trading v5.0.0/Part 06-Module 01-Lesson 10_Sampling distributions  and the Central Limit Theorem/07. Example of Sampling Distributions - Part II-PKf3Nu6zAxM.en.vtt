00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.554
If we wanted to identify the sample and statistic, from this visual,

00:00:07.554 --> 00:00:09.699
we would only use these cups,

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:14.734
which give a sample of five students where four of them don't drink coffee.

00:00:14.734 --> 00:00:19.359
This gives us a statistic that 20% of students drink coffee.

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:23.125
Remember, a population is our entire group of interest.

00:00:23.125 --> 00:00:26.230
Therefore, we have a population of 21 students,

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.225
and a portion that drink coffee of 71%.

00:00:30.225 --> 00:00:32.740
Moving back to our sample and statistic,

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.484
what if we didn't select these five individuals,

00:00:35.484 --> 00:00:38.755
but instead we selected these five here?

00:00:38.755 --> 00:00:42.295
How would you now answer the questions regarding the population,

00:00:42.295 --> 00:00:45.000
parameter, sample and statistic?
