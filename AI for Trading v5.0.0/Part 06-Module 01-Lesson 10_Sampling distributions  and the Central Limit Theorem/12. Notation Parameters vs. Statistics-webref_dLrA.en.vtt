00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:04.535
There are common ways to notate

00:00:04.535 --> 00:00:08.675
parameters that are different than the way we notate statistics.

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:12.589
In general, parameters are notated with Greek symbols,

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:14.869
where statistics are either notated by

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:19.309
lower case letters or the same Greek symbol with a hat on it.

00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:25.309
Here, this symbol called mu represents the mean of a population,

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:29.039
while these represent the mean of a sample.

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.399
Similarly, this Greek symbol called

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.123
sigma represents the standard deviation of a population,

00:00:35.124 --> 00:00:40.179
while either of these can be used to represent the standard deviation of a sample.

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:42.409
This same pattern continues.

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:45.875
Here, you can see common parameters and statistics.

00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:49.460
You can see the parameter and statistic values for

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.480
not only the mean and standard deviation but also for the variance,

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:57.274
proportions, and the values of coefficients and regression.

00:00:57.274 --> 00:01:01.729
You'll see all of these in later lessons in the statistics class.

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:05.509
This notation will be consistently used throughout these lessons,

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.310
as well as beyond this course,

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.000
in books, blogs, and other use cases.
