00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.910
So let's say we're studying the housing market and our task is

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.015
to predict the price of a house given its size.

00:00:06.015 --> 00:00:12.960
So we have a small house that costs $70,000 and a big house that costs $160,000.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.310
We'd like to estimate the price of

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.600
these medium-sized house over here. So how do we do it?

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.400
Well, first we put them in a grid where the x-axis represents the size

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.770
of the house in square feet and the y-axis represents the price of the house.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.960
And to help us out, we have collected some previous data in the form of these blue dots.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.840
These are other houses that we've looked at and we've

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.705
recorded their prices with respect to their size.

00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:47.640
And here we can see the small house is priced at $70,000 and the big one at $160,000.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.680
Now it's time for a small quiz.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.280
What do you think is the best estimate for the price of the medium house given this data?

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.090
Would it be $80,000, $120,000 or $190,000?

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.580
Submit your answer.
