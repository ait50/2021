00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.215
Well that was it. In this lesson,

00:00:02.215 --> 00:00:05.235
you have learned linear regression and some of its generalizations.

00:00:05.235 --> 00:00:07.170
You have also gone hands-on and implemented

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.560
the gradient descent algorithm for linear regression.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.690
You are now ready for the upcoming project in which you'll be implementing

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.880
a regression neural network to analyze real data. Great job.
