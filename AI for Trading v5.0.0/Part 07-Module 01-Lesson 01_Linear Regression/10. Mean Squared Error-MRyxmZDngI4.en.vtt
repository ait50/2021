00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.839
Now in this video we'll learn the Mean Squared Error.

00:00:02.839 --> 00:00:05.869
The Mean Squared Error is very similar to the Mean Absolute Error.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.820
Again, here we have our point and our prediction,

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.070
but now instead of taking the distance we're actually going to

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.099
draw a square with this segment as its side.

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.644
So the areas precisely y minus y hat squared.

00:00:16.644 --> 00:00:18.429
Notice that this is always non-negative,

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:20.789
so we don't need to worry about absolute values.

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.879
And our mean squared error is going to be the average of all these series of squares,

00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:28.269
and we're going to have this extra factor of one half for convenience later.

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:31.105
So in summary the area's one half times the average

00:00:31.105 --> 00:00:33.905
of the sum of all y minus y hat squared.

00:00:33.905 --> 00:00:37.030
Again, we can take the sum and call it the total square error,

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.615
but we take the average and this won't make a difference in the algorithm.

00:00:40.615 --> 00:00:43.719
Notice, if the point is over the line or underneath

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:46.659
the line the square is always going to be a non-negative number,

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:50.364
because the square of a real number is always going to be non-negative.

00:00:50.365 --> 00:00:52.685
The one half is going to be there for convenience

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:55.410
because later we'll be taking the derivative of this error.

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:57.899
Again, we can multiply this error by any constant and

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.589
the process of minimizing it will be the exact same thing,

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.215
so this one half does not affect anything.

00:01:03.215 --> 00:01:05.855
So here's a pictorial representation of the error.

00:01:05.855 --> 00:01:08.150
Here we have our points, our line,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.245
and the error is the average of the areas of all these squares.

00:01:12.245 --> 00:01:14.030
Here's our graph of the error.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.989
As we descend from this mountain we get to

00:01:15.989 --> 00:01:18.149
the place where the error is the smallest possible,

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.770
and that's the same as minimizing the average of the areas of the squares.
