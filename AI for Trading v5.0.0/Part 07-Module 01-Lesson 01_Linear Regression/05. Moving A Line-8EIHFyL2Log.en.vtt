00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.469
So, let's have a little refresher on how we move lines by changing the parameters.

00:00:04.469 --> 00:00:08.519
So, if we have a line of equation y equals w_1x plus w_2,

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.009
where w_1 and w_2 are constants,

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:14.279
it looks like this, w_1 is the slope and

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:18.674
w_2 is the y-intercept which is where the line intersects the y-axis.

00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:21.795
Now, what happens if we increase w_1?

00:00:21.795 --> 00:00:25.600
Well, we increase the slope so that means the line rotates like this.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.210
If we decrease w_1,

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.070
then we're decreasing the slope so the line rotates like this.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.774
Now, what happens if we increase the y-intercept w_2?

00:00:33.774 --> 00:00:36.979
Then the line moves in a parallel way up like this.

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:38.714
And if we decrease w_2,

00:00:38.715 --> 00:00:40.975
then the line moves like that to the bottom.

00:00:40.975 --> 00:00:43.520
That's really all we're going to need for the tricks that are coming.
