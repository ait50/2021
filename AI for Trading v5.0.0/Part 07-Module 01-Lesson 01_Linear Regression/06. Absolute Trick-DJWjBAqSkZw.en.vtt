00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.129
So, here's our first trick that we will align

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.734
closer to a point that we're going to use in a linear regression.

00:00:04.735 --> 00:00:07.620
It's called the absolute trick and it works like this,

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.224
we start with a point,

00:00:09.224 --> 00:00:14.919
and a line, and the idea is that the point wants the line to come closer to it.

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:16.949
So, let's put some numbers here,

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.379
the point has coordinates p comma q,

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:23.179
where p is a horizontal coordinate and q is the vertical coordinate.

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:27.870
The line has equation y equals w_1x plus w_2.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.215
In here w_1 is the slope and w_2 is the y-intercept.

00:00:32.215 --> 00:00:35.010
So, an easy way to move the line closer to the point

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:37.649
pq is to just add one to the y-intercept,

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.649
and then there is, the line moves up.

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:41.729
Now let's add something to the slope two to

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:43.909
make the line rotating the direction of the point.

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:47.489
This is going to look a little strange but it's going to make sense very soon.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.219
So, this distance over here is p because it's

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.409
the horizontal distance from the y-axis to the point.

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:55.904
So let's just add that, let's add p to the slope,

00:00:55.905 --> 00:00:58.859
and now our new slope is w_1 plus p,

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.320
and that rotates the line in this direction.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.939
Now our new equation is y equals w_1 plus p times x plus w_2 plus one,

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.230
and that's pretty much what the absolute trick is about.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.875
Notice some subtleties though,

00:01:11.875 --> 00:01:13.980
notice that we moved the line a little too much,

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.650
and we actually went over the point and kept going,

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.420
we don't want this, in general in

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.480
machine learning we never want to take big steps like this.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.475
Instead what we want to do is take tiny steps.

00:01:24.474 --> 00:01:26.849
So, in order to take a tiny step we'll just do

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:31.004
the exact same thing we did except we multiply everything by a small number.

00:01:31.004 --> 00:01:34.875
So let's take a small number called the learning rate, let's say alpha,

00:01:34.875 --> 00:01:39.340
and instead of adding one to the y-intercept and p to the slope,

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.710
we will add alpha times one to the y-intercept,

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:46.064
and alpha times p to the slope.

00:01:46.064 --> 00:01:49.349
Now the line moves up by a little bit and rotates a little bit,

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:51.674
so we don't have that risk of going too far.

00:01:51.674 --> 00:01:58.424
Our new equation is going to be w_1 plus p times alpha times x plus w_2 plus alpha.

00:01:58.424 --> 00:02:03.625
So our new slope is w_1 plus p times alpha and our new y-intercept is w_2 plus alpha.

00:02:03.625 --> 00:02:06.060
So we're doing better but there's still a little subtlety.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.560
What happens if the point is not on top of the line but underneath the line?

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.590
Well, same thing except now instead of adding we just subtract to get

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.969
our new equation w_1 minus b times alpha times x plus w_2 minus alpha.

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:24.419
The reason is if we subtract alpha to the y-intercept the line moves down instead of up

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:28.919
and if we subtract p times alpha to the slope the line rotates in this direction instead.

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:30.579
Something more interesting is this,

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.690
and that will explain the reason p is there.

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:36.509
If the point is not on the right of the y-axis but on the left of it,

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:40.378
than we still add one to the y-intercept because we need the line to move up,

00:02:40.378 --> 00:02:43.289
but the fact that now we're adding p to the slope and p is now

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:47.004
a negative number means that our line now rotates in this direction,

00:02:47.004 --> 00:02:49.240
so that's a reason for p to be there.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.280
Another reason for p to be there is this, check this out.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.914
If this distance is small then p is small,

00:02:54.914 --> 00:02:57.504
so we're adding a small number to the slope.

00:02:57.504 --> 00:02:59.990
Now, if the distance is large then p is

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.240
large so we're adding a large number to the slope.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.580
It makes sense that if the point is really

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.490
close to the y-axis we want to increase the slope by a little bit.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.265
Whereas if it's far want to move it by a lot more.

00:03:10.264 --> 00:03:12.824
So, let's do an example to make this more clear.

00:03:12.824 --> 00:03:17.185
Let's say we have the point 5 comma 15 and the line y equals 2_x plus three,

00:03:17.185 --> 00:03:20.890
so this means the distance from the point to the y-axis is five,

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:23.875
now let's say our learning rate is 0.1.

00:03:23.875 --> 00:03:26.699
So, we're adding 0.1 times one to

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:30.269
the y-intercept and that moves the line up by a little bit.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.555
Also we are taking five multiplying it by 0.1

00:03:33.555 --> 00:03:36.935
and adding that to the slope which makes the line move in this direction,

00:03:36.935 --> 00:03:42.979
this means our new equation is y equals 2.5 x plus 3.1.

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:45.599
Now, check out what happens if the point is in the left,

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.694
we're still adding 0.1 to the y-intercept to move the line up,

00:03:49.694 --> 00:03:53.025
but now to the slope we're going to add the product of

00:03:53.025 --> 00:03:57.000
0.1 and minus five, that's minus 0.5.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.199
This means our new equation is going to be 1.5 x plus 3.1.

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:05.349
As you can see the slope moved in

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.159
a different direction which made it go closer to the point.

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.145
So that's it, that's the absolute trick,

00:04:10.145 --> 00:04:13.320
and we're going to use it extensively in linear regression.
