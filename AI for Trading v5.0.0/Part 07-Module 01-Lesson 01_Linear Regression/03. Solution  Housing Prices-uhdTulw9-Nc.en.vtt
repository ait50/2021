00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
Well to help us out,

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.919
we can see that these points can form a line.

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:09.089
And we can draw the line that best fits this data.

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:13.500
Now on this line, we can see that our best guess for the price of the house is this point

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.660
here over the line which corresponds to $120000.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.685
So if you said $120000, that is correct.

00:00:22.684 --> 00:00:25.859
This method is known as linear regression.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.530
You can think of linear regression as a painter who would look at

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.914
your data and draw the best fitting line through it.

00:00:31.914 --> 00:00:34.829
And you may ask, "How do we find this line?"

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.000
Well, that's what the rest of the section will be about.
