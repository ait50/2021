00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
So this time there was a solution and the solution is

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.570
B and here's the reason which is more subtle.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.030
Our mean squared error is actually

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:13.484
a quadratic function and quadratic functions have a minimum at the point in the middle.

00:00:13.484 --> 00:00:17.785
Over here, we can see that the error for line A would be around here,

00:00:17.785 --> 00:00:20.339
the error for line C would be around here,

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:22.829
and the one for line B would be somewhere around here.

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:27.125
So we can see that the minimum mean square error is given by line B.

00:00:27.125 --> 00:00:29.879
Here's a diagram of the errors and you can check with your eyes

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:32.435
or even drawing a small example and calculating the areas;

00:00:32.435 --> 00:00:36.240
that line B would be giving you the smallest mean square error.
