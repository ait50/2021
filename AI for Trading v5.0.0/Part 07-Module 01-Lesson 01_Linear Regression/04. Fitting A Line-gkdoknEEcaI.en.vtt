00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.970
So here's a trick that will help us fit a line through a set of points.

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.505
Let's say that these are points and we start by drawing some random line.

00:00:08.505 --> 00:00:11.545
We're going to ask every point what it wants

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:14.219
for the model to be better and then listen to them.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.960
So let's go one by one,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.005
let's take this point over here and ask it what would it want the line to do?

00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:24.500
Well, the point would want the line to move closer.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.219
So, we listen to the point and move closer.

00:00:27.219 --> 00:00:30.829
Now, if we ask all the points they will tell us the same thing,

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:32.890
so we move closer to all of them.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.030
Then we'll listen to them again and we take another step that gets closer to all of them,

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.649
now it's trickier because we have a point

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:41.269
underneath that pulls it down but that's still okay.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.680
Basically, the idea is that we take a few steps that make us go

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:48.554
closer to all the points and that's it, that's linear regression.

00:00:48.554 --> 00:00:51.439
In the next few videos, we'll see this in a bit more detail.
