00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.620
Hi I'm Louis.

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.620
Welcome to the linear regression section of this Nanodegree.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.689
The two main families of algorithms and

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.199
predictive machine learning are classification and regression.

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:13.579
Classification answers questions of the form yes-no.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.609
For example, is this email spam or not,

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:19.044
or is the patient sick or not.

00:00:19.045 --> 00:00:22.415
Regression answers questions of the form how much.

00:00:22.414 --> 00:00:25.109
For example, how much does this house cost?

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.500
Or how many seconds do expect someone to watch this video?

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.925
In this lesson we'll learn how to answer this last type of questions.

00:00:31.925 --> 00:00:34.590
First, we will learn linear regression,

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.455
then some ways to improve it,

00:00:36.454 --> 00:00:40.119
and finally some ways to generalize it to non-linear cases.

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:42.759
Are you ready? Let's go!
