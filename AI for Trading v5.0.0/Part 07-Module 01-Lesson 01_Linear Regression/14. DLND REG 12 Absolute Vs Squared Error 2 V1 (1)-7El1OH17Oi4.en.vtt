00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.565
Well that was a tricky quiz.

00:00:01.565 --> 00:00:02.685
If you said the same,

00:00:02.685 --> 00:00:04.620
then you were correct because as you can see,

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.714
moving this line up and down actually keeps the mean absolute error the same.

00:00:08.714 --> 00:00:11.250
You can convince yourself by looking at the picture and

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.570
checking that as you move a line up and down,

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.379
you're adding a segment to two of the errors and

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.899
removing a segment of equal length to the other two errors.

00:00:19.899 --> 00:00:22.969
Now, let's repeat the quiz but with the mean squared error.

00:00:22.969 --> 00:00:25.529
The question is, which one of these three lines A,

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.490
B, and C would give us a smaller mean squared error?

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:30.399
Enter your answer below.
