00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.285
So here's a question, what is better the mean absolute error or the mean squared error?

00:00:05.285 --> 00:00:07.280
Well, there's no real answer to this.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.359
Both are used for a lot of different purposes,

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:12.074
but here's one property that actually tells them apart.

00:00:12.074 --> 00:00:14.609
So here's a set of data and we're going to try to

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:17.589
fit it by minimizing the mean absolute error.

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:21.054
So let's say we have line A, line B,

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:24.129
and line C. And the question is,

00:00:24.129 --> 00:00:27.789
which one of these lines gives us a smaller mean absolute error?

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:29.890
Enter your answer below.
