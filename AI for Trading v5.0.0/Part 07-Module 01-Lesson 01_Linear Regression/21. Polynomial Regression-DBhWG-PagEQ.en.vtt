00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.889
So what happens if we have data that looks like

00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:04.735
this where a line won't really do a good job fitting in?

00:00:04.735 --> 00:00:07.745
Maybe would like to have a curve or some polynomial.

00:00:07.745 --> 00:00:12.150
Maybe something along the lines of 2x cubed minus 8x squared, et cetera.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.900
This can be solved using a very similar algorithm than linear regression.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.429
All we have to do is instead of considering lines,

00:00:18.428 --> 00:00:20.769
we consider higher degree polynomials.

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:23.160
This would give us more weights to solve our problem.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.295
For example, this problem here we'll make a solve for four weights;

00:00:26.295 --> 00:00:29.105
w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4.

00:00:29.105 --> 00:00:31.629
But the algorithm is the same thing.

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:35.769
We just take the mean absolute or squared error and take the derivative with respect to

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.960
the four variables and use gradient descent to

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.094
modify these four weights in order to minimize the error.

00:00:41.094 --> 00:00:44.159
These algorithm is known as polynomial regression.
