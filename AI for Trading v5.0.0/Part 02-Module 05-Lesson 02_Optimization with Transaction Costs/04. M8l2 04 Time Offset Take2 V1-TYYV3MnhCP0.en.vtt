00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.009
An important thing to remember about

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:05.789
backtesting is that we're attempting to simulate live trading.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.169
So let's say we have some data from which we construct an Alpha,

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:14.504
and we also have the daily returns data that we use to

00:00:14.505 --> 00:00:19.185
realize gains or losses for our portfolio.

00:00:19.184 --> 00:00:22.934
If we look at the returns data recorded on Monday,

00:00:22.934 --> 00:00:27.750
we can't use data from that same day to construct the Alpha because

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.060
we may not actually have that data available until the market closes on that day.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:39.800
Now, what if we use Monday's data and returns from the next day on Tuesday?

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:44.854
Well, it means that we'd have the data before the market opens on Tuesday.

00:00:44.854 --> 00:00:49.144
But it would also assume that we make all our trades instantly

00:00:49.145 --> 00:00:53.905
that Tuesday morning in order to realize the returns for Tuesday.

00:00:53.905 --> 00:00:57.649
In reality, it takes time to execute a trade.

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.619
If you're updating portfolio positions daily,

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:04.730
then you'll also allocate a day to execute your trades.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.855
So a more realistic re-creation of live training would be to expect

00:01:08.855 --> 00:01:11.689
a two-day delay between when the data is

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.459
received and when the portfolio returns are realized.

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:18.279
This would mean that by the end of Monday,

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.495
we'd have the data to run portfolio optimization and choose the ideal positions,

00:01:23.495 --> 00:01:26.484
as well as decide how much to trade.

00:01:26.484 --> 00:01:28.679
We take the next day,

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.785
Tuesday to execute the trades that get us to the desired positions.

00:01:33.784 --> 00:01:37.250
Finally, on the day after on Wednesday,

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.504
we'd have the desired positions and realize the returns through that day.

00:01:42.504 --> 00:01:45.699
In other words, when constructing your backtest,

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.430
the data used to determine portfolio positions occurs

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.820
two days earlier than the returns that are realized on those portfolio positions.

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:58.934
In general, to make sure that your backtest is being setup properly,

00:01:58.935 --> 00:02:00.859
it helps to imagine yourself in

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:04.204
the situation where you're gathering the data on each day,

00:02:04.204 --> 00:02:07.774
making trade decisions, executing those trades,

00:02:07.775 --> 00:02:10.145
then realizing those returns.

00:02:10.145 --> 00:02:15.469
For instance, even though you may know that a certain company is bankrupt today,

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:19.159
your backtest data should still include that stock if

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:23.539
it's testing on a period in which that company was not yet bankrupt.

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:28.459
Another thing you may notice is that we're realizing returns every day,

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.270
but we're also executing trades every day.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.880
For example, on Wednesday,

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.960
we realized returns based on data received on Monday.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:45.370
Also on Wednesday, we are executing trades based on data received on Tuesday.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.115
So in live trading,

00:02:47.115 --> 00:02:50.719
the portfolio holdings are constantly changing throughout the day,

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:54.955
since trade executions occur every day, throughout the day.

00:02:54.955 --> 00:02:56.810
The portfolio holdings on

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.545
any given morning will have changed by the end of that same day,

00:03:00.544 --> 00:03:02.239
and we can expect this to have

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.575
a constant negative impact on the portfolio's expected return.

00:03:06.574 --> 00:03:12.004
We can account for this negative impact as part of the estimate of transaction costs,

00:03:12.004 --> 00:03:14.519
which we'll learn about in this lesson.
