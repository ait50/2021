00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.894
To get some intuition on transaction costs and the reason that trading impacts prices,

00:00:05.894 --> 00:00:09.960
let's look at what's called a limit order book which is a list of

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.195
all the bids and asks for an asset that are made by market participants.

00:00:15.195 --> 00:00:20.600
Bids are commitments to buy a certain quantity of an asset at a specified price.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.080
Asks also called offers,

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:28.109
are promises to sell a certain quantity of the asset at a specified price.

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.189
The lowest offer price is called the best offer,

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.949
because it's the one that is most likely to be picked up

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.010
by another participant who wishes to buy.

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:42.859
Similarly, the highest bid price is called a best bid,

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:47.104
since it's the highest price that a participant has committed to buy it.

00:00:47.104 --> 00:00:51.049
This means that another participant who wishes to sell will first

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:55.309
sell to this participant before selling at the other lower bids.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:01.204
The distance between the best bid and best offer is called the spread,

00:01:01.204 --> 00:01:04.010
as in, the bid-ask spread.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.890
The point at the middle of the bid-ask spread is called the midpoint price.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.674
The midpoint price is used as a benchmark from which to calculate transaction costs.

00:01:16.674 --> 00:01:20.069
We'll come back to the midpoint price in a little bit.

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:25.699
Let's say the execution desk of a hedge fund wishes to buy 300 shares of a stock.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.010
They can take a look at the existing offers to sell from other market participants.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.045
Notice how they could buy 100 shares at a particular price,

00:01:35.045 --> 00:01:39.740
but then they would either wait for other participants to offer at the same price,

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:43.009
or they could decide to pay slightly more to buy

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.880
additional shares because of what's being offered in the market.

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:51.304
In general, the total amount of shares that you may want to buy

00:01:51.305 --> 00:01:56.855
probably won't all be available from a single seller at a single price.

00:01:56.855 --> 00:02:03.290
So your original parent order is broken up into smaller child orders.
