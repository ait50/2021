00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
When doing optimization, you are usually write

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.269
the objective function and also its gradient.

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:10.169
Then you'll input both of these into an optimizer of your choice.

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:12.330
It's good practice to be able to write

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.035
both the objective function and its gradient in code.

00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:19.844
Even though some software packages calculate the gradient for you,

00:00:19.844 --> 00:00:24.974
in most cases, you want to be able to code the gradient explicitly by yourself.

00:00:24.975 --> 00:00:28.290
There are also different optimizers to choose from.

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.765
For example, if you check out the sai pi.optimize documentation,

00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:35.600
you'll see several optimizers listed.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.984
The BFGS method is a commonly recommended optimizer.

00:00:39.984 --> 00:00:43.835
In particular, the L-BFGS method

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:48.289
is designed to more efficiently handle large-scale problems.

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:53.253
You can also try out other methods that are suitable for large-scale problems,

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:54.820
such as the Powell,

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.350
Nelder-Mead, or Conjugate Gradient methods.
