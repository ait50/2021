00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.785
Now that we've moved beyond the Alpha research phase and into backtesting,

00:00:04.785 --> 00:00:08.339
we're going to refer to the set of positions on assets and

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:13.320
the portfolio as holdings as opposed to weights.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.030
In the research stage,

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:18.224
the weights are considered percentages of the portfolios

00:00:18.224 --> 00:00:22.574
notional and the notional doesn't need to be specified at this point.

00:00:22.574 --> 00:00:27.344
In backtesting, in order to increase the realism of the situation,

00:00:27.344 --> 00:00:32.729
the holdings are dollar amounts and we're testing with a specific portfolio size,

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:35.294
such as $50 million.

00:00:35.295 --> 00:00:37.500
Let's review how we define things in

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.480
the earlier factor modeling project and explain what's changed and why this matters.

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:45.875
Recall that in the factor modeling lesson and project,

00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:47.740
we're performing Alpha research.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.740
So we're not yet applying strategies to any particular portfolio.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.359
For standardization, we find weights whose sum of absolute values is one,

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:01.414
as in 100 percent of some portfolio size that is not yet defined.

00:01:01.414 --> 00:01:04.400
We do this by choosing to constrain the sum of

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.885
the absolute values of the positions to be less than or equal to one.

00:01:08.885 --> 00:01:12.740
Note that a strict equality constraint tends to make the optimization

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:16.954
infeasible which is why we set this to an inequality constraint.

00:01:16.954 --> 00:01:20.405
If the sum of the absolute values is less than 100 percent,

00:01:20.405 --> 00:01:26.000
we can assume this is as if we leave some cash on hand that isn't used to buy assets.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.355
If we assume no liquidity issues and no cost for executing trades,

00:01:31.355 --> 00:01:35.540
then we could apply the portfolio weights to a notional of for example

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.980
$50 million to convert those weights into holdings in units of dollars.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.469
When we're backtesting, we need to introduce

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:49.700
additional realities such as the cost of executing trades.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.990
We need to specify an actual portfolio size because

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:58.280
the size of a portfolio affects the cost of trade execution,

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.055
which in turn affects how well certain Alpha strategies perform.

00:02:03.055 --> 00:02:07.180
The size of the portfolio affects the size of the positions.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:13.765
The size of the positions in turn affects how costly it becomes to execute trades.

00:02:13.764 --> 00:02:16.688
Note that we'll define the size of the portfolio

00:02:16.688 --> 00:02:20.094
as the sum of the absolute values of the positions.

00:02:20.094 --> 00:02:23.305
So in backtesting, there's a difference between

00:02:23.305 --> 00:02:28.080
a $50 million portfolio and a $500 million portfolio.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.890
Strategies that may work on

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:34.224
a small portfolio may not work as well with a much larger portfolio.

00:02:34.224 --> 00:02:37.120
You may have heard about firms that purposely limit

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.939
their fund size in part because larger funds

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.639
encounter the challenge that there's an upper limit to

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:46.024
how much capital that can be deployed to a given Alpha strategy.

00:02:46.025 --> 00:02:49.730
This is due to limits in liquidity and transaction costs.

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:53.090
To make the distinction that the positions are dollar values,

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.789
we'll refer to the positions as holdings and not as weights.

00:02:57.789 --> 00:03:00.500
We'll make the distinction that these are holdings in order to be

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.213
more clear about what these positions represent,

00:03:03.213 --> 00:03:09.819
namely dollar values in a portfolio of a specified size as opposed to weights.
