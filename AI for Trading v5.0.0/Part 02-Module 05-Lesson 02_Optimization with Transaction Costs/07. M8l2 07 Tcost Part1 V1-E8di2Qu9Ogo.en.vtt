00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
An important reality of investment management is that

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.540
transaction costs are incurred when making trades.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.740
For institutional traders, the cost is due to the impact of trade

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.955
has on the market price of the asset being bought or sold.

00:00:14.955 --> 00:00:17.670
When you buy an asset in large enough amounts,

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.890
this tends to push the price upward.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.679
When you sell an asset in large enough amounts,

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:25.004
this tends to push the price downwards.

00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:27.719
This price movement is a cost to you as

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:30.344
the investment manager because when you're buying,

00:00:30.344 --> 00:00:33.435
you'd prefer to pay the lowest price possible.

00:00:33.435 --> 00:00:36.030
But the act of buying large quantities,

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.539
makes the price you pay more and more expensive.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:42.284
Similarly, when you sell an asset,

00:00:42.284 --> 00:00:45.079
you'd prefer to sell it at a higher price.

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.814
But when the act of selling starts to push the price downward,

00:00:48.814 --> 00:00:53.530
the cash that you receive for selling is also reduced.
