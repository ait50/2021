00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
Let's discuss how minimizing the terms in the objective function

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.369
serves a similar purpose as some commonly used constraints.

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:12.119
The parts of the objective function that we've seen before are

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:16.814
the portfolio's risk explained by the factors called the common risk.

00:00:16.815 --> 00:00:19.844
There's the specific risk of the portfolio

00:00:19.844 --> 00:00:23.565
that's due to individual assets in the portfolio.

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:26.865
There's also the expected portfolio return.

00:00:26.864 --> 00:00:31.634
The transaction costs term is the cost due to trading.

00:00:31.635 --> 00:00:37.410
First, there's the market neutral constraint that the sum of the holdings is zero.

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:43.189
In other words, the sum of long positions equals the sum of short positions.

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:48.250
When the optimizer minimizes the common risk that's due to the risk factors,

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.049
it is also adjusting the holdings in order to

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:54.184
reduce the imbalance between longs and shorts.

00:00:54.185 --> 00:00:57.500
Remember that market risk is also a factor.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.469
So the way an optimization can reduce exposure

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.890
to the market is by being close to dollar neutral.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.219
So this has a similar effect as the hard constraint that

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:11.090
requires the sum of holdings to be exactly zero.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.579
Next, let's think about constraining the risk due to large positions.

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:20.884
The leverage constraint limits the maximum of the absolute values

00:01:20.885 --> 00:01:25.910
to below a certain threshold in order to limit this position size risk.

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.549
If we look at the objective function,

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.530
the risk aversion parameter in

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.864
the objective function sets the total dollar risk of the portfolio.

00:01:34.864 --> 00:01:40.314
This means that the risk aversion parameter helps to control the portfolio size,

00:01:40.314 --> 00:01:45.454
which is the gross market value or sum of the magnitudes of the holdings.

00:01:45.454 --> 00:01:50.194
Now, let's think about the constraint that attempts to diversify the portfolio

00:01:50.194 --> 00:01:54.949
by setting a limit on the maximum holding on any single asset.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.530
Can you think of which terms in the objective function may serve a similar purpose?

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.284
Notice that we have a term for a specific risk,

00:02:04.284 --> 00:02:07.340
also called idiosyncratic risk.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.784
This is the risk that is specific to each individual asset.

00:02:11.784 --> 00:02:16.090
When the optimizer attempts to minimize the specific risk,

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.240
this also serves to diversify the portfolio by

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.960
limiting the portfolio's exposure to any single asset.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.040
In other words, minimizing the specific risk helps to keep

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:31.099
the holding on any single asset from getting too large.

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.359
Note that the transaction cost term would limit

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.440
the speed at which a concentrated position would be built,

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:42.919
but would not prevent that holding from increasing over time.
