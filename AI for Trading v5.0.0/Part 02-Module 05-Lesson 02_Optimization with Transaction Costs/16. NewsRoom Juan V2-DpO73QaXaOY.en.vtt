00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.654
Hello everyone, we're back with Gordon,

00:00:02.654 --> 00:00:05.264
and we're going to talk about reinforcement learning.

00:00:05.264 --> 00:00:08.910
So Gordon, you're most well known in the quant and

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.605
academic communities for your work on applying reinforcement learning in finance.

00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:17.730
How's reinforcement learning being applied in finance right now,

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.205
and what do you think it will be used for in the future?

00:00:21.204 --> 00:00:23.599
Well, right now, inside of some of

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.505
the largest investment banks that do algorithmic execution,

00:00:27.504 --> 00:00:30.980
reinforcement learning is being used to help those algorithms make

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.564
better decisions at the microstructure level.

00:00:34.564 --> 00:00:37.039
This is because reinforcement learning

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:40.714
does very well in situations where you have a lot of data,

00:00:40.715 --> 00:00:43.265
and yet a finite action space.

00:00:43.265 --> 00:00:45.649
So for example in execution,

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.039
the available actions typically take the form of choosing to

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:53.210
place limit orders at the bid or the ask or canceling orders.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.030
So it's a discrete action space and that makes

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.490
traditional optimization methods usually based on

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.255
a continuous space more challenging to apply.

00:01:02.255 --> 00:01:04.400
In the future, there are a lot of

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.890
potential applications for reinforcement learning to solve

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.620
various kinds of optimal hedging and optimal execution problems,

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.960
especially for options and other derivatives.

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:17.209
Interestingly, in some sense,

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:19.009
the derivatives community has been using

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.405
reinforcement learning all along without necessarily even realizing it.

00:01:23.405 --> 00:01:25.310
What I mean by that is,

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.379
financial derivatives are priced according to

00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:32.000
the optimal value function of the replicating strategy.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.609
Reinforcement learning is simply a way of finding

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:38.870
the optimal value function in a very general and often model-free way,

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.435
in a way that makes it easier to incorporate transaction costs.

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:46.430
Is there enough interest in reinforcement learning right now in the quant community?

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.150
Does it show a lot of promise?

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.760
Is it an active area of research?

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.545
I think it's a very active area of research.

00:01:53.545 --> 00:01:58.329
For example, my longtime friend and collaborator, Peter Comb,

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:01.825
and I were invited to contribute an article to

00:02:01.825 --> 00:02:06.234
the first inaugural issue of the Journal of Financial Data Science.

00:02:06.234 --> 00:02:10.150
Our article was on dynamic hedging of

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.844
option positions in illiquid markets using reinforcement learning.

00:02:14.844 --> 00:02:18.655
There have also been a number of very interesting papers by

00:02:18.655 --> 00:02:23.544
my colleague Igor Halperin from the NYU Tandon School of Engineering.

00:02:23.544 --> 00:02:26.679
Great. Are there any hedge funds or

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.135
trading firms that are using reinforcement learning right now?

00:02:30.134 --> 00:02:35.129
Yes. I believe the largest investment banks who are also the most sophisticated on

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.144
the algorithmic execution side have actually

00:02:38.145 --> 00:02:42.844
been researching it and potentially using it for years.

00:02:42.844 --> 00:02:45.349
That means that hedge funds are then using it indirectly

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.189
because they rely on those banks for execution services.

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:52.520
Great. Are there any limitations or

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.870
problems that you foresee in applying reinforcement learning through finance?

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.515
Yes. I think the technology itself needs to get better.

00:03:00.514 --> 00:03:04.174
There has been a lot of excitement around deep reinforcement learning,

00:03:04.175 --> 00:03:07.019
where the nonlinear function approximator

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.115
that is used to approximate the optimal value function,

00:03:10.115 --> 00:03:14.784
is everyone's favorite function approximator on neural network.

00:03:14.784 --> 00:03:16.650
So in this area, unfortunately,

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.539
the technology is often rather slow to converge.

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:23.959
Sometimes requiring days to train,

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.795
and even that is on specialized hardware.

00:03:26.794 --> 00:03:28.929
For example, AlphaGo Zero.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.870
Certain key theoretical results,

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.240
the one would ideally like to have on convergence of the method, are also lacking.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.025
Neural networks can get stuck in local minima, for example,

00:03:39.025 --> 00:03:44.480
that prevents proving a lot of convergence results that we have for simpler methods.

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:47.539
So is there a different nonlinear function approximator

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:49.495
that will be more convenient to work with?

00:03:49.495 --> 00:03:52.099
Maybe, but a lot more research needs to be done.

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.250
It feels like we're at the stage of development right now that

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.685
standard optimization methods were out in the 1960s.

00:03:58.685 --> 00:04:00.814
Well, thank you so much Gordon for your time.

00:04:00.814 --> 00:04:02.719
Looking forward to seeing you again soon.

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:04.419
Thanks for having me.
