00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.625
In this lesson, you learned about some core steps that you take to design a backtest.

00:00:05.625 --> 00:00:09.960
You practiced incorporating a time delay to account for when information is

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.280
received and to allow for trading into the desired position.

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:17.730
You also learn to model transaction costs and design

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.855
the optimization with computational efficiency in mind.

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:24.210
I hope you'll have some fun adjusting

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.980
the backtest design and seeing how this affects your backtest results.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.164
You'll also get a chance to customize your backtest in the project.

00:00:33.164 --> 00:00:38.399
Coming up next, we'll look at how to interpret the Profit and Loss of your alphas by

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.085
identifying what factors contributed to the final P&amp;L and by how much.

00:00:44.085 --> 00:00:47.329
This process is called performance attribution.

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.219
It's what you'll learn in the next lesson. Stay tuned.
