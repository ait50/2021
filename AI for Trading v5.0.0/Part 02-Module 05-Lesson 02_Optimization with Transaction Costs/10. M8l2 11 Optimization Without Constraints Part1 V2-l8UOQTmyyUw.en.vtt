00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
In previous projects, you've learned about various constraints that you might

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.524
apply to an optimization in order to adhere to certain requirements.

00:00:09.525 --> 00:00:13.875
A constraint in an optimization falls into one of two categories.

00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:17.190
Either the constraint does nothing to the solution,

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.420
or the constraint makes the solution sub-optimal.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.560
Constraints can also cause the optimizer to run more slowly,

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:28.154
and time is a real cost when your back-testing,

00:00:28.155 --> 00:00:32.250
as you want to be able to iterate and test in a reasonable amount of time.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.509
Also, we may choose from a different set of optimization algorithms,

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:39.869
and some may not support inequality constraints.

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:42.769
So in general, it would be better to avoid setting

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.445
explicit constraints unless it's mandated by the fund.

00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:49.880
For instance, if you're managing a long only fund,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.429
then you would still need to constrain the holdings to be

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:55.810
positive only to avoid short positions.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.480
The good news is, we can still satisfy the goals of

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:03.875
various constraints with the terms that we put into the objective function.

00:01:03.875 --> 00:01:06.019
Let's think about some constraints,

00:01:06.019 --> 00:01:08.854
such as making the positions market neutral,

00:01:08.855 --> 00:01:13.445
limiting risk from large positions which is the leverage constraint,

00:01:13.444 --> 00:01:16.714
and limiting the exposure to any single stock

00:01:16.715 --> 00:01:20.920
which is a maximum holding constraint for a single stock.
