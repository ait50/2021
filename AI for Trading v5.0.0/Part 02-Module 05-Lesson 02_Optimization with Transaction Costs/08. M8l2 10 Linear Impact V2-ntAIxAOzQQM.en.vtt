00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.575
Now that you have some intuition of how transaction costs arise,

00:00:04.575 --> 00:00:09.330
let's discuss how to model transaction costs as a function of the trade.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.839
Well, think about what's called a Linear Impact Model.

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:18.585
So we're looking for an independent variable that has an effect on a dependent variable.

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:23.760
The dependent variable is some measure that describes transaction cost.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.605
As we saw in our prior discussion about temporary and permanent price impact,

00:00:28.605 --> 00:00:33.585
the transaction cost comes from a change in the market price of the asset.

00:00:33.585 --> 00:00:39.270
Next, let's think about the independent variable that drives the change in price,

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.609
and hence the transaction cost.

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:43.740
Based on our prior discussion,

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.000
it's fair to assume that the larger the trade,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.119
the larger the impact on the market price.

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:52.640
But let's think about this for a moment.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.460
If you trade $10,000 of a stock,

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.465
is that considered a large trade or a small trade?

00:00:59.465 --> 00:01:03.230
You might want to know how many total dollars of that stock

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.295
were traded on that day by all market participants,

00:01:07.295 --> 00:01:12.314
in order to decide whether $10,000 is a lot or a little.

00:01:12.314 --> 00:01:14.700
If our trade makes up one-tenth of

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.245
one percent of the total dollars traded for that stock,

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:21.400
this might be considered a small amount.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.890
If our trade makes up 10 percent of the total dollars traded for that stock on that day,

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.665
then they would be considered a large trade and would be more likely to affect the price.

00:01:33.665 --> 00:01:37.100
So we can calculate the independent variable as

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:40.774
a fraction of total dollars traded that day.

00:01:40.775 --> 00:01:44.520
We'll call this the trade size.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.000
If we had execution data from market makers such as major banks,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.385
we could estimate the slope of that line.

00:01:52.385 --> 00:01:55.430
Since most of us don't have access to this data,

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.300
another way to find this slope is to look in academic papers,

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:05.370
especially ones where the researchers estimated this using real execution data.

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.710
A good estimate that we can use for our purposes,

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.040
is that each one percent of the average daily volume

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:17.314
traded moves the price by 10 basis points.

00:02:17.314 --> 00:02:24.125
The cost in dollar terms is the percent change in price times the dollar amount traded.

00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:26.870
Note that a Linear Impact Model gives

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.150
a readily understandable description of how trade impacts price.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.705
There is also evidence to support a Square Root Impact Model.

00:02:36.705 --> 00:02:39.713
That is to say, as trades get larger,

00:02:39.713 --> 00:02:45.539
the impact on price is not as strong as one would expect from a Linear Model.
