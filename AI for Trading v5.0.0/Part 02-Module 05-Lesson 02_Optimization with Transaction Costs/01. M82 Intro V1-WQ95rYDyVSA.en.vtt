00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
Hi. In this lesson,

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.370
we'll show you how to design the portfolio optimizer for a back-test.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.949
The major theme of this lesson is how to design the back-test,

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:13.629
so that it's realistic enough that it's results are meaningful.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.125
You'll get familiar with data provided by Bara,

00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:19.824
which is widely used in the quant industry.

00:00:19.824 --> 00:00:24.294
You'll practice adding the time delay that exist during live trading.

00:00:24.295 --> 00:00:28.775
You'll learn more about design considerations in the optimization,

00:00:28.774 --> 00:00:33.445
and we'll also learn to incorporate transaction costs in the optimizer.

00:00:33.445 --> 00:00:35.770
By the time you complete this lesson,

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.325
I hope you'll have a good foundation that you can build upon during the project.

00:00:40.325 --> 00:00:42.880
All right. Let's get started.
