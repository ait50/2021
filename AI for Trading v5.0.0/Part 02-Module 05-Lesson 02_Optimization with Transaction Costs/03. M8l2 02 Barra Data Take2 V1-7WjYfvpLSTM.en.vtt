00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.099
Barra data, we'll be using factor data that is generated by Barra.

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:10.274
This will be good practice because Barra data is used throughout the industry.

00:00:10.275 --> 00:00:12.179
Note that we've preprocessed

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.960
the raw Barra data files and sort the data into pickle files.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.675
The alternative would be to load the original data,

00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:20.880
and perform the parsing each time,

00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:22.544
each time you do the back-test.

00:00:22.545 --> 00:00:25.290
Since parsing and preprocessing takes time,

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.929
we recommend doing the preprocessing once and

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:31.710
saving the preprocessed data for later use in your back-test.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.899
Now, this is important because we did spend a lot of time preprocessing

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.280
the raw files so that when you actually run the back-test it would be faster.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.890
We want to bring this up so that when you're actually

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.140
on the job and working with the raw files,

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.969
you'll also understand the process of trying to optimize for speed by first

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:55.795
parsing out things like strings into numbers or strings into dates, for instance.

00:00:55.795 --> 00:00:59.840
Factors. Note that the data fields that start with

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.460
the prefix U-S-F-A-S-T are factor exposures.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:06.634
One column for each factor.

00:01:06.635 --> 00:01:12.350
We will use some of these as Alpha factors and the rest as risk factors.

00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:16.754
The reason this makes sense is that for the time periods in which we're back-testing,

00:01:16.754 --> 00:01:20.619
some of these factors were able to produce better than average returns.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.180
Barra works with his clients and gathers

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.300
information about Alphas that worked in the past.

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.060
These were calculated on historical data to

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.405
produce the factor exposure data found in Barra.

00:01:32.405 --> 00:01:37.370
Here's a partial list of the Barra factors in our dataset and their definitions.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.250
These are collected from documentation by Barra.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.314
There are style factors and industry factors.

00:01:44.314 --> 00:01:48.019
The industry factors will be used as risk factors.

00:01:48.019 --> 00:01:52.699
You can consider using the style factors as Alpha factors.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.685
Any factors not use as Alpha factors can be included in the risk factors category.

00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:00.969
So this will be in the exercise notebook.

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:04.265
So take your time reading through some of these descriptions,

00:02:04.265 --> 00:02:07.640
and when you look at the actual column names,

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.520
they will be abbreviated versions of what you see here.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.875
So these are the full descriptions,

00:02:12.875 --> 00:02:16.069
and you'll be able to match the full descriptions with

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.984
the shortened names in the headers of the tables.

00:02:19.985 --> 00:02:22.100
Now, one point I'll make is that there's

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.169
a separate variable DataFrame that's holding the covariances of the factors,

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:27.814
and it looks like this.

00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:33.349
There's a column for one of the factors and a column for another factor and a column

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:38.599
for the covariance between these two factors as well as the date that is recorded on.

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.449
So there's a DataFrame for each date,

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:43.099
and with any state or frame,

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.639
there's the pairwise covariances of each of the factors.
