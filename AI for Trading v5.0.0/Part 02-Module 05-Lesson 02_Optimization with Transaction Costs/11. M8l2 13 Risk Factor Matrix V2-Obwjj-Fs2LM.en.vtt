00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.835
Now, we'll discuss additional ways in which we can improve on the portfolio optimization.

00:00:05.835 --> 00:00:09.599
Let's think about the covariance matrix of factors.

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.619
If we have 70 risk factors in our model,

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:18.644
then the covariance matrix of factors is a 70 by 70 square matrix.

00:00:18.644 --> 00:00:22.469
The diagonal contains the variances of each factor,

00:00:22.469 --> 00:00:28.799
while the off-diagonals contain the pairwise covariances of two different risk factors.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.280
In general, it's good to have a healthy suspicion of correlations and covariances,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.405
and to ask if correlation data adds information or just more noise.

00:00:41.405 --> 00:00:44.480
One way to be conservative about the information in

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:50.439
a covariance matrix is to shrink the covariances or even reduce them to zero.

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:54.500
In other words, we could keep just the variances along the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.840
diagonal and set the covariances in the off-diagonals to zero.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.445
In the case where we're using the covariance matrix in a risk factor model,

00:01:04.444 --> 00:01:08.089
there's also some additional intuition for why we can use

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.530
just the variances and discard the covariances.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:19.030
The goal of the optimizer is to reduce the portfolio's exposure to these risk factors.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.760
So if the optimizer reduces the portfolio's exposure to

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.365
risk factor one and also reduces its exposure to risk factor two,

00:01:27.364 --> 00:01:32.060
then it's less important to know exactly how factor one varies with factor two

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.775
since the optimizer is already working to reduce portfolio exposure to both factors.

00:01:37.775 --> 00:01:41.359
In other words, you can still achieve the goal of reducing

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:46.254
portfolio exposure to all the factors if you're using just the variances,

00:01:46.254 --> 00:01:50.329
whether you include the factor covariances or not.

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.329
You may wonder, "What are the benefits of throwing

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:55.774
away the information about covariance?"

00:01:55.775 --> 00:01:57.620
In addition to making your model more

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.969
conservative and limiting possible noise in your data,

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:05.510
a diagonal matrix also makes matrix operations more efficient.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.080
This theme of computational efficiency is one that you'll come

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.015
across in many use cases including backtesting.

00:02:13.014 --> 00:02:17.359
Backtesting is a computationally and time-intensive process.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.610
So the more efficient you can make it,

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.070
the more quickly you can test your alphas and iterate to make improvements.
