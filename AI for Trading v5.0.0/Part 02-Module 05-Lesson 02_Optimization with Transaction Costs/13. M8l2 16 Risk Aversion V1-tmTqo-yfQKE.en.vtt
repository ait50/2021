00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.784
The risk aversion term,

00:00:01.784 --> 00:00:05.339
is set to target a particular size for the portfolio.

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.080
When we say "size",

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.740
this could be any measure of size such as gross market value,

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.269
value at risk, volatility, or leverage.

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.494
The risk aversion parameter maps one-to-one onto any of these size metrics.

00:00:21.495 --> 00:00:28.050
By that, I mean that decreasing the risk parameter increases the size of the portfolio,

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.330
and increasing the risk parameter,

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.524
decreases the size of the portfolio.

00:00:33.524 --> 00:00:39.614
The risk aversion parameter allows you to target whatever size metric that you prefer.

00:00:39.615 --> 00:00:42.469
The gross market value is the dollar value of

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.769
the absolute value of the long and short holdings,

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.350
also called the L1 norm.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.414
When we think about what it means to take more risks when investing,

00:00:52.414 --> 00:00:57.185
taking bigger bets with more money is a way to take on more risk.

00:00:57.185 --> 00:01:00.320
The risk aversion term controls how much risk we

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.679
take by controlling the dollar amount of our positions,

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:06.329
which is the gross market value.
