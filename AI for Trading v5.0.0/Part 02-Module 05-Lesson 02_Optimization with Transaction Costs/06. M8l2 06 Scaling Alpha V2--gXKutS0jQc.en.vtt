00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.459
Note that the terms we're calculating for the objective function will be in dollar units.

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:09.089
So the expected portfolio return defined

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:12.990
as the dot product of the alpha vector with the holding vector,

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.224
will be in dollar units.

00:00:15.224 --> 00:00:19.230
The vector of portfolio holdings will be in dollar units.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.269
So now, let's think about the vector of alpha factor exposures.

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.519
To keep the whole expression of portfolio return in dollar units,

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.064
the factor exposures will be in units of percent change.

00:00:34.064 --> 00:00:36.719
The question is, how much?

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.004
Barra usually scales the factor exposures

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:43.130
so that they are between negative five and positive five.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.380
Centered around zero and transform it to make it more of a normal distribution.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.390
Based on the size of the exposure values,

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.829
we will make an assumption that a factor exposure of

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:01.405
one unit maps to one basis point of daily return on that stock.

00:01:01.405 --> 00:01:06.870
Note that, a basis point is one percent of one percent or,

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.400
one divided by 10,000, which is 0.0001.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.454
To see why this assumption is reasonable,

00:01:15.453 --> 00:01:21.439
let's use these assumed daily returns of one basis point per day and analyze them.

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.909
Over 252 trading days,

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.435
the annualized return is about 2.55 percent.

00:01:28.435 --> 00:01:33.590
Similarly, a stock with daily return of negative one bases point per

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.915
day would have an annualized return of negative 2.49 percent.

00:01:38.915 --> 00:01:41.780
This means that the spread between

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.969
the positive return stock and negative returns stock would be about five percent.

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:49.129
So the spread between a stock with

00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:54.739
a positive one factor exposure and a stock with a negative one factor exposure,

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:58.219
would have an annualized return difference of about five percent.

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:01.405
This is a reasonable order of magnitude.

00:02:01.405 --> 00:02:04.394
To see why this is a decent assumption,

00:02:04.394 --> 00:02:09.139
we can compare it to a different assumption that does not lead to a reasonable spread.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:13.549
For instance, let's see what happens if we assume that one unit of

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.689
factor exposure leads to ten basis points of daily return.

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.164
For a stock with plus ten basis points of daily return,

00:02:23.164 --> 00:02:27.909
this is an annualized return of 28.6 percent.

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:32.210
For a stock with a negative ten basis points of daily return,

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.980
this is an annualized return of negative 22.3 percent.

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:42.259
So the spread between these two stocks would be 51 percent,

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:46.024
which is too large to be in the right order of magnitude.

00:02:46.025 --> 00:02:50.330
For our back-test, we can make an assumption that one unit of

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.695
factor exposure translates to about one basis point in daily returns.

00:02:54.694 --> 00:03:00.859
In other words, the estimated daily return is one basis point times the factor exposure,

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:08.080
where one basis point is 0.0001 or ten raised to the negative four.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.094
Note that if we want it to be more precise,

00:03:11.094 --> 00:03:13.580
we could estimate a linear relationship between

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.730
the factor exposures and the daily return on a stock.

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:19.310
But for now, we'll make this assumption and

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.550
multiply one basis point to the alpha vector of

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:29.189
factor exposures so that the expected portfolio return expression is in dollar units.
