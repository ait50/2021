00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
Recall that the mid-point price is the middle of the bid-ask spread.

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.414
Before we begin to execute a parent order,

00:00:08.414 --> 00:00:10.469
the mid-point price can serve as

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.280
the benchmark from which we estimate the transaction cost.

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:16.994
For each child order that is traded,

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:19.920
the difference between the price paid and

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.410
this benchmark is a measure of the trade cost which is called slippage.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.410
We can think of slippage as the sum of two kinds of price impact.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.659
There's the temporary price impact and permanent price impact.

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:39.169
Temporary impact refers to the slippage that always

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.890
exists even when the bid-ask spread does not change.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.829
This is because, the price you pay when buying

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.539
the asset is always a bit more than the mid-point benchmark price.

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.379
The permanent impact refers to an actual shift in

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.280
the bid-ask spread and therefore, the mid-point price.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.490
This is what we refer to when we say a trade is

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.875
large enough that it begins to impact the market price.

00:01:05.875 --> 00:01:11.459
Here's an example of how a sell order is broken up into several child orders,

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:14.524
where the orders are shown as red triangles.

00:01:14.525 --> 00:01:18.005
Looking at the chart from left to right, we can see that,

00:01:18.004 --> 00:01:20.390
during the execution of the sell order,

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.040
the price initially drops quite a bit which becomes a cost of the transaction.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.240
Some of this price shift may have been due to the market participants as a whole

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:34.179
and some of it could have been due to the individual trader himself.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.030
Note that, we can't be sure what part of the price drop is caused

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.719
by our own trading or by the rest of the markets trading.

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:46.234
It could be the case that the price would have dropped without us making any trades.

00:01:46.234 --> 00:01:50.329
In which case, our decision to sell the asset was a good decision.

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.420
It could also be that our trades make up enough of

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.430
the total volume traded that we're moving the market price.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.185
Near the middle of the chart,

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:03.620
we can see additional sell orders where the price did not drop significantly.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.980
Here, we can assume more of the slippage is due to

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.770
temporary price impact unless it's due

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.840
to a permanent impact that has shifted the market price.
