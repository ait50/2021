If you aren’t the author, you can still upvote the answer you find most helpful.\n- When you write a new question, make sure to include all relevant details—tag a specific project if necessary.\n\nIf you see a question that you think you know the answer to, answer it! (And don’t worry—there’s no penalty for being wrong about an answer.)\n",
