In fact, its precise meaning depends on the way the interest rate is measured. For an interest rate statement to be clear, the magnitude and time dependence of the rate of interest, as well as the frequency of compounding, must be clearly stated.\n\nIf the interest rate is measured with annual compounding, the bankâ€™s statement that the interest rate is 4% means that $100 grows to <span class=\"mathquill\">\\$100\\times(1 + .04) = \\$104 </span> at the end of 1 year. \n\nWhen the interest rate is measured with semiannual compounding, it means that 2% is earned every 6 months, with the interest being reinvested. In this case, $100 grows to <span class=\"mathquill\">\\$100\\times(1 + .04/2)\\times(1 + .04/2) = \\$100\\times(1 + .04/2)^2 = \\$104.04</span>, at the end of 1 year. \n\nWhen the interest rate is measured with quarterly compounding, the bankâ€™s statement means that 1% is earned every 3 months, with the interest being reinvested. The $100 then grows to <span class=\"mathquill\">\\$100\\times(1 + .04/4)^4 = \\$104.06</span> at the end of 1 year.\n\n",

If you assumed that the benefit of compounding more and more frequently had a limit, you would be right! How do we calculate this limit? Well, first we write down the formula for compounding,\n\n<span class=\"mathquill\">p_t = p_{t-1}(1 + \\frac{r}{n})^n</span>,\n\nand then we notice that what we'd like to do is make n bigger and bigger. We want the limit as n goes to infinity. Well, it turns out that this limit is: \n\n<span class=\"mathquill\">\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left( 1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^n = \\mathrm{e}^r\n</span>\n\nCompounding infinitely often is called _continuous compounding_. So what does this mean?

An important first step is to think of these prices and returns as _random variables_, i.e. outcomes of random phenomena, that take on values as described by _distributions_. Distributions allow us to summarize the behavior of random variables.

              "text": "Let's summarize what we just learned. These are some generally accepted reasons that quantitative analysts use log returns:\n\n1. Log returns can be interpreted as continuously compounded returns. \n2. Log returns are time-additive. The multi-period log return is simply the sum of single period log returns. \n3. The use of log returns prevents security prices from becoming negative in models of security\nreturns.\n4. For many purposes, log returns of a security can be reasonably modeled as distributed according to a normal distribution.\n5. When returns and log returns are small (their absolute values are much less than 1), their values are approximately equal.\n6. Logarithms can help make an algorithm more numerically stable.\n\nStepping back, it may not be immediately obvious why all these attributes are benefits. Don't worry about this. As you progress in this course and beyond, you will see more applications of returns and log returns in trading strategies and algorithms and you'll be able to better appreciate why they are used.",
