00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.030
Looking at the next category of machine learning,

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:12.029
unsupervised learning creates models for

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:15.189
data when there are no preexisting labels to train on.

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:16.530
So, in a sense,

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.870
it can be called unsupervised.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.530
It turns out that the applications for these techniques are pretty vast,

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.190
from reducing a dataset to a fewer number of useful features,

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.170
to grouping similar items,

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.830
to building music recommendation systems.

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.409
The final type of machine learning is known as reinforcement learning,

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:39.649
which is used to train algorithms that learn based on taking

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.935
certain actions and receiving rewards for those actions.

00:00:43.935 --> 00:00:48.500
The applications of reinforcement learning includes self-driving cars and

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.619
game-playing agents like the recent agent that beat experts at the game of Go.

00:00:53.619 --> 00:01:00.390
This map gives a nice overview of the prominent areas of machine learning in use today.
