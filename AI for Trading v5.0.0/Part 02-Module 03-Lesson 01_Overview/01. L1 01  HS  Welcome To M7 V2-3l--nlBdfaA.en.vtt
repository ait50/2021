00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.279
Welcome back. Right now,

00:00:02.279 --> 00:00:05.294
we're two projects into the term with two more to go.

00:00:05.294 --> 00:00:09.120
So far, you've mainly learned about basic and advanced techniques in

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:11.594
natural language processing that you can use

00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:14.700
to generate alpha signals from alternative data.

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:18.000
Now we're going to switch gears a little bit and think about

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.109
combining several alpha signals together to build a portfolio.

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.559
We did this before in the multi-factor models project,

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:28.079
but then we just combined alpha signals and

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.719
a robust but fairly simple linear way by averaging them.

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.899
In this project, we're going to combine the alpha factors in

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.504
a much smarter non-linear way using machine learning to help us.

00:00:40.505 --> 00:00:44.810
I'm especially excited about the next set of lessons and project,

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.429
not only because they were designed by

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:50.119
Jonathan Larkin but also because they will teach you one way to

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:55.789
apply AI in a finance context in a manner that suits the strengths of the algorithm,

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.859
avoids overfitting and aligns with industry practice.
