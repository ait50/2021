00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.089
Machine Learning has three main categories,

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:13.634
Supervised, Un-supervised, and Reinforcement Learning.

00:00:13.634 --> 00:00:15.734
In Supervised Machine Learning,

00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:18.390
our algorithms learn from labeled data.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.728
After studying the labeled data,

00:00:20.728 --> 00:00:25.544
these techniques are able to determine which label should be given to new data,

00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:27.210
based on observing patterns,

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.170
and associating those patterns to new unlabeled data.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.965
Supervised Learning can be divided into two categories, classification and regression.

00:00:37.965 --> 00:00:42.345
Classification models predict a category that an item belongs to.

00:00:42.344 --> 00:00:45.439
Many people believe that these models are used for

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:48.289
events with only two possible outcomes,

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:50.494
like whether an email is spam or not.

00:00:50.494 --> 00:00:55.640
But most can actually be extended to predict any number of categories.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.329
For example, there are classification techniques that allow us

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.379
to predict which of many breeds a dog belongs to.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:09.314
Alternatively, regression models predict a numeric value like home price,

00:01:09.314 --> 00:01:11.560
or an individual's height.
