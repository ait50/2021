00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.745
All right. So, back to vector addition and multiplication by numbers.

00:00:03.745 --> 00:00:08.544
After all, every topic in linear algebra is going to center around these two operations.

00:00:08.544 --> 00:00:11.484
Luckily, each one's pretty straightforward to define.

00:00:11.484 --> 00:00:13.219
Let's say we have two vectors,

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.540
one pointing up and a little to

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:17.224
the right and the other one pointing right and down a bit.

00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:19.145
To add these two vectors,

00:00:19.144 --> 00:00:23.369
move the second one so that its tail sits at the tip of the first one.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.730
Then, if you draw a new vector from the tail

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.010
of the first one to where the tip of the second one now sits,

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.395
that new vector is their sum.

00:00:32.395 --> 00:00:34.460
This definition of addition by the way,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.219
is pretty much the only time in

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:39.859
linear algebra where we let vectors stray away from the origin.

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:42.155
Now, why is this a reasonable thing to do?

00:00:42.155 --> 00:00:45.355
Why this definition of addition and not some other one?

00:00:45.354 --> 00:00:50.224
Well, the way I like to think about it is that each vector represents a certain movement,

00:00:50.225 --> 00:00:53.950
a step with a certain distance and direction in space.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.855
If you take a step along the first vector,

00:00:56.854 --> 00:01:00.439
then take a step in the direction and distance described by the second vector,

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:02.750
the overall effect is just the same as if you

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.694
move along the sum of those two vectors to start with.

00:01:05.694 --> 00:01:08.069
You can think about this as an extension of how we

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:10.389
think about adding numbers on a number line.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.575
One way that we teach kids to think about this,

00:01:12.575 --> 00:01:15.219
say with 2 + 5 is to think of moving

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:18.715
two steps to the right followed by another five steps to the right.

00:01:18.715 --> 00:01:22.740
The overall effect is the same as if you just took seven steps to the right.

00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:26.399
In fact, let's see how vector addition looks numerically.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.770
The first vector here has coordinates 1,2.

00:01:28.769 --> 00:01:32.649
And the second one has coordinates 3,-1.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.965
When you take the vector sum using this tip to tail method,

00:01:37.965 --> 00:01:42.189
you can think of a four-step path from the origin to the tip of the second vector.

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:46.674
Walk one to the right then two up then three to the right then one down.

00:01:46.674 --> 00:01:50.729
Reorganizing these steps so that you first do all of the rightward motion,

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.365
then do all the vertical motion,

00:01:52.364 --> 00:01:55.944
you can read it saying first move 1 + 3 to the right,

00:01:55.944 --> 00:01:59.739
then move 2 - 1 up.

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:05.875
So, the new vector has coordinates 1 + 3 and 2 + -1.

00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:08.560
In general, vector addition in this list of

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.830
numbers conception looks like matching up their terms and adding each one together.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.170
The other fundamental vector operation is multiplication by a number.

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:22.299
Now this is best understood just by looking at a few examples.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.675
If you take the number two and multiply it by a given vector,

00:02:25.675 --> 00:02:30.620
it means you stretch out that vector so that it's two times as long as when you started.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.594
If you multiply that vector by say one third,

00:02:33.594 --> 00:02:37.805
it means you squish it down and so that it's one third the original length.

00:02:37.805 --> 00:02:41.965
When you multiply it by a negative number like negative 1.8,

00:02:41.965 --> 00:02:47.340
then the vector first gets flipped around then stretched out by that factor of 1.8.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.420
This process of stretching or squishing or sometimes

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:53.819
reversing the direction of a vector is called scaling.

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.849
And whenever you catch a number like two or one third or

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.394
negative 1.8 acting like this scaling some vector,

00:03:00.395 --> 00:03:02.110
you call it a scalar.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.220
In fact, throughout Linear Algebra,

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:07.590
one of the main things that numbers do is scale vectors.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.125
So, it's common to use the word scalar pretty much interchangeably with the word number.

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:15.469
Numerically, stretching out a vector by a factor of say,

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:20.500
two corresponds with multiplying each of its components by that factor two.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.270
So, in the conception of vectors as lists of numbers,

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.920
multiplying a given vector by a scalar means

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:29.959
multiplying each one of those components by that scalar.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.360
You'll see in the following videos what I mean when I say that

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.840
linear algebra topics tend to revolve around these two fundamental operations,

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.710
vector addition and scalar multiplication.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.849
So, they're your vector basics and in the next video,

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.275
I'll start getting into some pretty neat concepts surrounding vectors like span,

00:03:47.275 --> 00:03:50.550
basis and linear dependence. See you then.
