00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.474
The fundamental root of it all building block for linear algebra is the vector.

00:00:15.474 --> 00:00:17.280
So, it's worth making sure that we're all on

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.160
the same page about what exactly a vector is.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.890
You see, broadly speaking,

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.824
there are three distinct but related ideas about vectors,

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:26.849
which I'll call the physics student perspective,

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.500
the computer science student perspective and the mathematician perspective.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.689
The physics student perspective is that vectors are arrows pointing in space.

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:36.324
What defines a given vector,

00:00:36.325 --> 00:00:39.030
is its length and the direction it's pointing.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.945
But as long as those two facts are the same,

00:00:40.945 --> 00:00:43.530
you can move it all around and it's still the same vector.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.429
Vectors that live in the flat plane,

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:47.979
are two-dimensional and those sitting in broader space,

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:50.924
that you and I live in, are three-dimensional.

00:00:50.924 --> 00:00:56.009
The computer science perspective is that vectors are ordered lists of numbers.

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:59.640
For example, let's say you were doing some analytics about house prices,

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.075
and the only features you cared about were square footage and price.

00:01:03.075 --> 00:01:05.650
You might model each house with a pair of numbers,

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.040
the first indicating square footage and the second indicating price.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.640
Notice, the order matters here.

00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:16.109
In the lingo, you'd be modeling houses as two-dimensional vectors,

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:20.155
where in this context vector is pretty much just a fancy word for list,

00:01:20.155 --> 00:01:21.823
and what makes it two-dimensional,

00:01:21.823 --> 00:01:24.920
is the fact that the length of that list is two.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.340
The mathematician, on the other hand,

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.640
seeks to generalize both these views,

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.060
basically saying that a vector can be anything

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.590
where there's a sensible notion of adding two vectors,

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.430
and multiplying a vector by a number,

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.185
operations that I'll talk about later on in this video.

00:01:39.185 --> 00:01:41.790
The details of this view are rather abstract,

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.100
but the reason they bring it up here,

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:45.530
is that it hints at the fact that the ideas of

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.075
vector addition and multiplication by numbers,

00:01:48.075 --> 00:01:50.870
will play an important role throughout linear algebra.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.015
But before we talk about those operations,

00:01:53.015 --> 00:01:56.064
let's just settle in on a specific thought to have in mind,

00:01:56.064 --> 00:01:57.670
when I say the word vector.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.239
Given the geometric focus that I'm shooting for here,

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:02.909
whenever we introduce a new topic involving vectors,

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.364
I want you to first think about an arrow, and specifically,

00:02:06.364 --> 00:02:09.284
think about that arrow inside a coordinate system,

00:02:09.284 --> 00:02:10.659
like the x, y plane,

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:12.620
with its tail sitting at the origin.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.509
This is a little bit different from the physics student perspective,

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:18.514
where vectors can freely sit anywhere they want in space.

00:02:18.514 --> 00:02:21.029
In linear algebra, it's almost always

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.034
the case that your vector will be rooted at the origin.

00:02:24.034 --> 00:02:28.699
Then, once you understand a new concept in the context of arrows in space,

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:31.479
we'll translate it over to the list of numbers point of view,

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:34.334
which we can do by considering the coordinates of the vector.

00:02:34.335 --> 00:02:38.250
Now, while I'm sure that many of you are already familiar with this coordinate system,

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.789
it's worth walking through explicitly,

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:42.209
since this is where all of the important back and

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.280
forth happens between the two perspectives of linear algebra.
