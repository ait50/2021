00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.009
Focusing our attention on two dimensions for the moment,

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:07.950
you have a horizontal line called the x-axis and a vertical line called the y-axis.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.449
The place where they intersect is called the origin,

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:13.954
which you should think of as the center of space and the root of all vectors.

00:00:13.955 --> 00:00:16.545
After choosing an arbitrary length represent one,

00:00:16.545 --> 00:00:19.850
you make tick marks on each axis to represent this distance.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.920
When I want to convey the idea of 2D space as a whole,

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.929
which you'll see comes up a lot in these videos,

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:27.179
I'll extend these tick marks to make grid lines,

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:29.600
but right now they'll actually get a little bit in the way.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.800
The coordinates of a vector is a pair of numbers that basically gives

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:38.494
instructions for how to get from the tail of that vector at the origin to it's tip.

00:00:38.494 --> 00:00:41.849
The first number tells you how far to walk along the x-axis.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.905
Positive numbers indicating rightward motion,

00:00:43.905 --> 00:00:46.024
negative numbers indicating leftward motion,

00:00:46.024 --> 00:00:51.089
and the second number tells you how far to walk parallel to the y-axis after that.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.125
Positive numbers indicating upward motion,

00:00:53.125 --> 00:00:55.844
and negative numbers indicating downward motion.

00:00:55.844 --> 00:00:57.839
To distinguish vectors from points,

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.685
the convention is to write this pair of numbers

00:00:59.685 --> 00:01:02.780
vertically with square brackets around them.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.724
Every pair of numbers gives you one and only one vector,

00:01:07.724 --> 00:01:12.129
and every vector is associated with one and only one pair of numbers.

00:01:12.129 --> 00:01:13.879
What about in 3-dimensions?

00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:17.500
Well, you add a third axis called the z-axis which is

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.510
perpendicular to both the x and y axis and in this case,

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.545
each vector is associated with an ordered triplet of numbers.

00:01:24.545 --> 00:01:27.600
The first tells you how far to move along the x-axis,

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:31.569
the second tells you how far to move parallel to the y-axis and

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:36.029
the third one tells you how far to then move parallel to this new z-axis.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.870
Every triplet of numbers gives you one unique vector in space.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.719
And every vector in space gives you exactly one triplet of numbers.
