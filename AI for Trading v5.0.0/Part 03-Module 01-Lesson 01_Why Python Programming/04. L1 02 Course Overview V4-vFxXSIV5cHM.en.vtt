00:00:02.299 --> 00:00:07.710
Whether you're a beginner in programming or have experience in other languages,

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.000
this course is well-structured to help you develop fluency in Python.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.015
Each lesson includes videos,

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:19.710
text summaries, quizzes and coding activities for each concept.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.245
If you'd like to move through the course faster,

00:00:22.245 --> 00:00:26.250
you can skip directly to text summaries and quizzes to test your knowledge,

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.085
and go back to videos if you get stuck.

00:00:29.085 --> 00:00:31.964
However, if you are new to programming,

00:00:31.964 --> 00:00:37.009
I strongly recommend watching the videos for a detailed walk-through of each topic.

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:39.989
Here's an overview of what you learn.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.575
You'll start off learning about the basics of python in lesson two;

00:00:43.575 --> 00:00:46.310
data types and operators.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.195
These are the building blocks you use to write your programs.

00:00:50.195 --> 00:00:54.429
In lesson three, you'll dive into control flow tools.

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:56.740
You learn about conditional statements,

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.609
loops, built-in functions, and list comprehensions.

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:02.545
With control flow tools,

00:01:02.545 --> 00:01:06.055
you'll be able to write more complex and creative code.

00:01:06.055 --> 00:01:10.945
In lesson four, you'll learn about function definitions, variable scope,

00:01:10.944 --> 00:01:16.479
documentation, lambda expressions, iterators, and generators.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.000
This is where things can become a little tricky.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.650
But these are also some of

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.450
the most important tools you'll need to use in day-to-day practice.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.600
Finally, the last lesson will show you how to run your code

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:33.265
locally and scripts that take in raw input and work with files.

00:01:33.265 --> 00:01:37.480
You'll also learn about error handling and importing different libraries.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.030
I know this looks like a lot of content,

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.144
but there's plenty of review and practice

00:01:42.144 --> 00:01:45.000
throughout the course to reinforce what you're learning.
