00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.939
As you learn Python throughout this course,

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.519
there are a few things you should keep in mind.

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:12.759
First, unlike languages like SQL,

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:14.908
Python is case sensitive,

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:18.519
meaning these two words mean two different things.

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:22.059
Second, spacing is important in Python.

00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:25.584
Since it isn't very heavy on syntax like other languages,

00:00:25.585 --> 00:00:27.460
it relies a lot on spacing,

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.620
which can be confusing at first,

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.039
but really nice and clean when you get the hang of it.

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:37.284
Third, there will be times you get errors in this course.

00:00:37.284 --> 00:00:40.649
Keep in mind, errors don't make you a bad programmer.

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.894
It's just a computer telling you it doesn't understand.

00:00:43.895 --> 00:00:47.465
Use error messages to help you learn how to write code

00:00:47.465 --> 00:00:51.780
that can be interpreted the way you wish. Let's get started.
