Hi there. I'm Juno and I'm really excited you want to learn Python.

00:00:08.654 --> 00:00:10.544
Before coming to Udacity,

00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:14.625
I worked as a data scientist and used Python for data analysis,

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:17.445
machine learning, and deep learning projects.

00:00:17.445 --> 00:00:22.019
Python is one of the most widely used programming languages in industry.

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.064
It's a powerful, general purpose language with

00:00:25.065 --> 00:00:28.695
applications ranging from web development to data science.

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:31.859
In this course you'll learn how to apply Python

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.689
and good programming practices to solve practical problems.
