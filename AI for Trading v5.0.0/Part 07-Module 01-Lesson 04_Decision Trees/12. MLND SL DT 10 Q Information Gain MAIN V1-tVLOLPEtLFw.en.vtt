00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.399
Okay, so now, we'll use what we know about

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.995
entropy and information gain to build Decision Trees.

00:00:04.995 --> 00:00:06.690
Let's say, we have our data in the form of

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.929
these red and blue points and we want to split it into two.

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.244
So, I'll show you three ways of splitting it,

00:00:12.244 --> 00:00:14.564
and here are the three ways.

00:00:14.564 --> 00:00:17.640
Now, let's have a small quiz: In which of

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.730
these do you think we have gained more information about

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.530
our data and in which one did we gain less information? Enter your answers below.
