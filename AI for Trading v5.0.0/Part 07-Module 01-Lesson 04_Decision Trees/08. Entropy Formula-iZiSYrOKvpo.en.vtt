00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
In order to cook up a formula for entropy,

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.750
we'll consider the following game.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.540
In this game, we'll start with a configuration of balls;

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.955
say red, red, red,

00:00:08.955 --> 00:00:12.150
and blue, and we'll put them inside the bucket.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.509
Now, what we do is we pick four balls out of this bucket with

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.585
repetition and we try to get the initial configuration;

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:22.440
red, red, red, blue and if we do, we win.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.140
Let's say we pick our first ball and it's red.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.080
We record the color and put it back.

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:30.464
Then, we pick a second ball and it's red.

00:00:30.464 --> 00:00:33.030
So, we again record the color and put it back.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.575
Then, we pick a third ball,

00:00:34.575 --> 00:00:37.965
say red and record the color and put it back.

00:00:37.965 --> 00:00:40.110
Notice that we pick the same ball again.

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:43.469
This is completely okay. Finally, we pick a fourth ball.

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.515
Now, we got blue, we record it, and put it back.

00:00:46.515 --> 00:00:48.105
We recorded red, red, red,

00:00:48.104 --> 00:00:49.889
blue. So, we win a lot of money.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.484
If say we got the colors red,

00:00:52.484 --> 00:00:56.789
blue, blue, red, then we will win no money at all.

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.504
That's the game. Now, the quiz question is,

00:00:59.505 --> 00:01:02.190
which one of the three buckets is the best to play the game

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:06.200
with and which one is the worst? Enter your answer below.
