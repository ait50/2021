00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.679
Well, let's try both.

00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:05.280
The best horizontal line would be somewhere around here.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.699
It does an okay job, but it doesn't really separate the points that well,

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:11.579
at least a lot of blue points in the red area and vice versa.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.650
So, what happens if we try a vertical line?

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.500
Well, it seems that the best cut is here around five.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.629
That does a pretty good job and only leaves

00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:22.304
five red points on the blue side and five blue points on the red side.

00:00:22.304 --> 00:00:23.925
So, let's go for that one,

00:00:23.925 --> 00:00:26.219
and our answer is vertical line.

00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:30.269
This means that the best feature to separate this data is test,

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.564
and the best threshold is five.

00:00:32.564 --> 00:00:37.655
Therefore, we can add our first node to the decision tree and this node asks,

00:00:37.655 --> 00:00:41.960
"Is your test greater than or equal to five or is it less than five?"

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.880
And now, we can do even more.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.570
We can try dividing each of the two halves with a horizontal line,

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.130
which is the equivalent of saying, "Okay.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.455
I've seen your tests.

00:00:51.454 --> 00:00:53.899
Now, let's see how you did in the grades."

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.280
The left half can be cut with a vertical line over here at height seven.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.134
This means, if your test score is less than five,

00:01:02.134 --> 00:01:05.365
then you need seven or more in the grades to get accepted,

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:07.689
otherwise, you get rejected.

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:11.819
The right half can be separated with a vertical line at height two.

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:15.959
This means, if your test score is greater than or equal to five,

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:19.328
then you need to have two or more in your grades in order to get accepted,

00:01:19.328 --> 00:01:21.404
otherwise, you get rejected.

00:01:21.405 --> 00:01:24.195
So, we've built our Decision Tree in a similar way as before,

00:01:24.194 --> 00:01:25.964
except now at each node,

00:01:25.965 --> 00:01:27.855
we don't have a yes/no question,

00:01:27.855 --> 00:01:31.329
but we have a threshold which would cut the values in two.
