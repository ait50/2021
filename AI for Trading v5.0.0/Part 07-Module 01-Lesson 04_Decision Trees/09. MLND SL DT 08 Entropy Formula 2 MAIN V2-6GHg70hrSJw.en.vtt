00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
Well, it seems that the first bucket is the best one,

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.810
because no matter what we do,

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:04.980
we'll always pick red, red,

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.065
red, red so we'll win every time.

00:00:07.065 --> 00:00:11.040
We can see that although it's not very easy to win in any of the other two,

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:12.389
it's easier to pick red,

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:13.919
red, red, blue in the second one,

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:15.629
and much harder to get red,

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.595
red, blue, blue in the third one.

00:00:17.594 --> 00:00:21.193
Thus, the answers are: the best bucket is the first one,

00:00:21.193 --> 00:00:22.419
the next one is okay,

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.750
and the third one is the worst.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.910
But by how much more specifically?

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.589
Let's ask the following question.

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:32.369
What is the probability of winning in each of these games?

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.884
So, let's start by the easy one.

00:00:33.884 --> 00:00:36.039
How likely is it to winning this game?

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:38.869
Well, to get the first ball to be red,

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:40.909
the probability is actually one.

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:43.144
Same thing for the second one,

00:00:43.145 --> 00:00:46.010
the third one, and the fourth one.

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:49.219
Since we put the ball back after recording each color,

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:51.649
then these events are completely independent.

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:57.004
So, the probability that they all occur is the product of the four probabilities.

00:00:57.005 --> 00:00:59.090
This means the probability is one,

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.925
which matches our intuition that no matter what we do,

00:01:01.924 --> 00:01:04.564
we'll always pick red, red, red, red.

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:05.959
Now let's go to the red,

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:07.714
red, red, blue case.

00:01:07.715 --> 00:01:11.465
What is the probability that the first ball we'd pick is red?

00:01:11.465 --> 00:01:17.810
Well, it's three over four or 0.75 since there are three red balls, and four in total.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.045
Same thing for the second,

00:01:20.045 --> 00:01:21.980
and the third balls.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.189
Now what's the probability of the fourth ball we pick his blue?

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.269
Well now it's one over four since there's only one blue ball among four.

00:01:29.269 --> 00:01:33.140
Therefore again, since the events are independent the probability

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.754
of the four of them happening is the product of the four probabilities,

00:01:36.754 --> 00:01:43.250
which is 0.75 times 0.75 times 0.75 times 0.25.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.694
This is 0.105 or around ten 10 percent probability of winning here.

00:01:47.694 --> 00:01:51.422
And for the last one, well the chances here of getting a red ball are 50 percent,

00:01:51.423 --> 00:01:53.805
since there are two red balls and two blue balls.

00:01:53.805 --> 00:01:56.745
And the chance of getting a blue ball are the same.

00:01:56.745 --> 00:02:00.480
Thus, the chance of these balls being red, red, blue,

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.219
and blue is the product,

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.859
which is 0.0625 or roughly six percent for winning in this game.

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:10.080
We summarize these results in the table over here,

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.930
where the first column has a probability of a ball being red,

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.224
the second one off the ball being blue,

00:02:15.224 --> 00:02:18.539
and the last one we highlight the probability of winning.

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:21.449
Now products are confusing mainly for two reasons.

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:23.189
The first one is that if we have,

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:24.560
say a a thousand balls.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.205
Now, we take the product of a thousand numbers all between zero and one.

00:02:28.205 --> 00:02:29.990
This could be very tiny.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.090
The other reason is that a small change in one of

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.729
the factors could drastically alter their product.

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:36.739
We want something more manageable.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.495
And what's better than products?

00:02:38.495 --> 00:02:40.189
Let's ask our friend here.

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:42.050
Yes, he is right.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.895
Sums are better than products.

00:02:43.895 --> 00:02:46.909
And now we just need to turn the products into sums.

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:49.579
Would any of the following functions be able to help us?

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.365
The options are sine,

00:02:51.365 --> 00:02:54.770
cosine, logarithm, or exponential.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.400
Enter your answer below.
