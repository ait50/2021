00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And the approximate answer is 0.236.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
That's the probability of exactly 9 heads out of 12 coin flips

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
for this heavily loaded coin that mostly gives you heads.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And again, the answer is 12!/12-9. This is 3! 9!.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Then we have to compute the probabilities being (0.8)⁹

00:00:25.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and 1-0.8 is 0.2³ and that is the number over here.
