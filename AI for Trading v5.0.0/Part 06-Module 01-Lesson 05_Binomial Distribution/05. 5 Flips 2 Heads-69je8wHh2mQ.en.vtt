00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And the answer is 10 and this is a non-trivial answer.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So you could go and place the first heads anywhere in these five elements--say here--

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and there's five different ways to place heads.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
You can now place the second heads among the remaining four--for example, you could place it

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
over here and it gives you a factor of four different ways of placing the second heads.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
But when you do this, you over count--you over count exactly by a factor of 2 in the business.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
You place the first heads over here, the second over here, but if it was chosen to place

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
the first head on the right side and the second head over here on the left side,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and the outcome would've been exactly the same, so you counted the one twice

00:00:44.000 --> 99:59:59.999
which means we have to divide it by 2--5 times 4/2 is 10
