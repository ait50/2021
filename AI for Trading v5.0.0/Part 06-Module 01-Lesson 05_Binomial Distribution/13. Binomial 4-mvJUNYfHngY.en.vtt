00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's now say for the same loaded coin, we flip that coin five times with that same load of probability

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
over here and we care about the out of five times heads comes exactly four times.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Now, I want you to compute this probability over here, It's a completely nontrivial question.

00:00:16.000 --> 99:59:59.999
