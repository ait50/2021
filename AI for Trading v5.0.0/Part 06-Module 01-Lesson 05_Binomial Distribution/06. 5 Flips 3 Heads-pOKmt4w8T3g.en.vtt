00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And that log is 10 again. There's two proofs.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
One is I can just flip heads and tails. So three heads means two tails.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I can do the exact same game as before where I placed tails as opposed to heads

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and it gives me the same equation as before, but let's do it the new way, three heads.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I can place 5*4*3--the first heads, the second and the third.**

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
For the first, I have five positions, for the second--four, and for the third--three are left.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This gives me the combinatorics for those heads, but now I'm over counting.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
How much am I over counting?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Well, suppose I'm committed to put the three heads into the three slots over here and that's not given.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And I just wonder in which order I've put them in,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
so I might put the first one here, the first one here, the first one here.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Then for the first one placed in here, there's now three different ways of placing it.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
For the second one, there's two different ways of placing it.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
For the third one, it's not deterministic--there's just one slot left.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So I over count this by a factor of 6--there are 6 different ways of placing these three heads

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:17.000
into these three slots, so the result is 543/321 producing the 5*2=10.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And that is insightful.
