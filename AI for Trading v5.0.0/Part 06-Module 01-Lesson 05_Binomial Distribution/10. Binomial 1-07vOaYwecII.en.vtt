00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now, we know from our previous consideration

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that there are five ways in which the number of heads could be one.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
5!/4! 1! happens to be 5.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We also know that there are 32 possible outcomes. It is 2⁵=32 outcomes.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
This is the size of a truth table. So, 5 out of 32 outcomes has exactly 1 head.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So, I would suggest that the answer is 5/32, and my calculator tells me this is 0.15625.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So, that is actually interesting.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
If you flip a coin five times, there's a chance that it only comes at head exactly once

00:00:39.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and that is the probability 0.15625.
