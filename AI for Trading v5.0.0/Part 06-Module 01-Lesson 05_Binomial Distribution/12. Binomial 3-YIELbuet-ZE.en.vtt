00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So here is my truth table of these eight different outcomes.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The ones that has head exactly once are this one, this one, and this one,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
but they're not all equally likely.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Heads, heads, heads is much more likely than say tails, tails, tails

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
because heads has a probability of 0.8^3.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This one here has an outcome probability of 0.8Â³ while this one has an outcome probability of 0.2^3.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
All of the green ones have the same outcome probability.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
They all have exactly one head 0.8 and two tails.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So as before, we took the probability to be one of these heads in the truth table.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:50.000
This time each of those has a probability of 0.032. That's each one of the three.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Now, we have to consider all of these three outcomes, which means you're going to add 0.032

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
for each one of those three guys over here and this gives me as an answer 0.096.

00:01:02.000 --> 99:59:59.999
That's a nontrivial question.
