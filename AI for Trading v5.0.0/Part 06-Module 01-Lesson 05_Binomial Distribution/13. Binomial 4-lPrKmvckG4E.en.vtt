00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So interestingly enough, we can do the trick as before 5!/4!*1!,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
which is the number of outcomes at exactly 4 heads and we know that's 5.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Four heads means one tails. There's five ways to place one tails and this one over here.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The question now what's the probability of those?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Well, they have heads four times, (0.8)โด and tail once to (0.2)ยน.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So we do is we multiply the total number of outcomes that have this property

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
with each one probability, which happens to be the same because we get exactly four times heads

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and 1 times tail and multiplying these things together gives us 0.4096.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:02.000
This over here is indeed 0.4096 and the 5*0.2 cancels the others out,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
so that's the result in this specific case.

00:01:04.000 --> 99:59:59.999
The cancellation doesn't always happen. It's a rare circumstance.
