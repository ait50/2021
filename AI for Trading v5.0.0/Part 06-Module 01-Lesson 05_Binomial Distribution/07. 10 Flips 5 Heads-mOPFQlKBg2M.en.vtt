00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Let's say I have 10 coins. You just get 10 of these shiny silver coins here. So we got 10 coins.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And I want about 4 heads in these 10 coins, and just apply the same logic to find an answer.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The first time I'll do it for you.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I can place those heads in 1098*7 different slots if they were counted.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Now that I'm committed to having chosen these slots, the implementations of those are 432*1.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:50.000
That gives me 5,040/24, also known as 210, so that's 210 outcomes out of 2 to 10th outcomes

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
which is 1024 in which exactly 4 heads are observed and 5 tails.

00:00:56.000 --> 99:59:59.999
Now it's your turn. 5 heads out of 10 coins. One of them coming up to heads.
