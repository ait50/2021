00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.839
In this lesson, we found the probability that

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.679
a coin would land on heads k times out of n flips.

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.859
If the probability of heads for the coin is p,

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:18.405
we get the following formula for the probability that the number of heads will be k.

00:00:18.405 --> 00:00:25.525
The first half is n factorial over n minus k factorial times k factorial.

00:00:25.524 --> 00:00:28.484
This part keeps track of the total number of ways

00:00:28.484 --> 00:00:32.519
we can get k heads and n total flips of the coin.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.825
For example, if we were looking at three heads and four flips,

00:00:36.825 --> 00:00:39.030
we could get this set of flips,

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.795
or this set, or this set, or this set.

00:00:43.795 --> 00:00:48.600
There are four possible ways we can get three heads out of four flips.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.090
This part of the formula keeps track of

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.380
how many possible ways we can get these k heads and n flips.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.340
In this case four.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.510
Each one of these ways have the following probability of event occurring.

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:05.870
P to the k times 1 minus p to the n minus k. The p

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.575
to the k keeps track of the probability associated with the number of heads.

00:01:10.575 --> 00:01:15.305
And this part keeps track of the probability associated with the number of tails.

00:01:15.305 --> 00:01:17.210
Altogether, this formula gives

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:20.534
the probability of what's called the binomial distribution.

00:01:20.534 --> 00:01:24.319
You've now seen how you can take very large experiments with

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:27.229
many coin flips and compute the probability that

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.325
the coin will land heads a certain number of times with this formula.

00:01:31.325 --> 00:01:34.915
Although the examples in this lesson use coin flips,

00:01:34.915 --> 00:01:39.740
you can really perform these calculations with any events that have two outcomes.

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:41.405
Does a customer buy or not?

00:01:41.405 --> 00:01:43.415
Is a transaction fraud or not?

00:01:43.415 --> 00:01:46.210
Or if a coin flip is heads or tails.

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:50.759
Binomial distributions are used to give us insight about all of these.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.140
Later in the course,

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.019
you will explore large experiments again using the normal distribution.

00:01:56.019 --> 00:01:57.780
But first, let's move on to

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.570
conditional probability where events are no longer independent.

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:03.839
Let's explore cases where the outcome of

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.000
an event can affect the outcome of the events that follow.
