00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The key observation is that this thing over here is n!/(n-k)!

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and to see this let's go back to the case where we had 4 heads.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
In the 4 heads case, we multiplied all the way to times 5 over here.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We only multiplied all the way to 7. These are the 4 heads that we placed.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So n! goes from 10 all the way to 1. (n-k)! goes from 10-4 and that's 6 all the way to 1.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So this blue expression over here will go from 10 x 9 x 8 and so on all the way to 1

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
over now n-k, 10-4 is 6. 6*5*4 and so on.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
When you look at this, the 6*5*4 occurs on top as well.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So we can cut those out and what remains is 10*9*8*7. This one over here.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Now once we place these 4 heads, we have to divide by a 4 factorial

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
which is different ways of placing those 4 points into the predefined bins.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So put differently, this is k! so if we put all this together you get n!/(n-k)!*k!

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
This is the expression over here. Let's practice this one last time.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Say you have 125 coins and you ask how many ways exists in which 3 coins come up heads.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
What is the resulting outcome? Be careful when you use your calculator.

00:01:42.000 --> 99:59:59.999
It might result in an overflow, but the answer is easy to compute.
