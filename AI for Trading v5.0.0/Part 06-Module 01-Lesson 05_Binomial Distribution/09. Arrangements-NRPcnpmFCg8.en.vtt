00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So, I get 317,750, and the logic is I just plug in these numbers, 125!/122! 3!.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:25.000
When I evaluate this, I find that these guys can be easily reduced to 125*124*123.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:34.000
From 122 on, these factors exactly cancel. 3 expands to 3*2*1 also known as 6.

00:00:34.000 --> 99:59:59.999
When you divide these two things, you get 317,750.
