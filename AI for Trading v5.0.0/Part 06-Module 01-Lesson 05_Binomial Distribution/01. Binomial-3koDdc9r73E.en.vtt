00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So we talked about coin flips, and we flipped some coins.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now, I want to flip many coins including this 2-dollar coin

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
whose country of origin I just don't remember.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Perhaps you can post on the forum where this 2-dollar coin might be from.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So let's ask an easy quiz. Suppose we do 2 coin flips.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I would like to know how many outcomes of these 2 coin flips are there

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and which number of heads equals the number of tails

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
which in this example means you would have head exactly once and tails exactly once.

00:00:31.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Give me that number.
