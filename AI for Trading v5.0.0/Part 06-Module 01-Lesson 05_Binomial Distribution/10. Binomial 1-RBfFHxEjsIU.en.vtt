00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And let's really ask about probabilities.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's say for now, we have a fair coin with a probability of heads is 0.5.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
If I flip a coin five times, what's the probability the number of heads is exactly 1.

00:00:12.000 --> 09:59:59.000
You should be able to compute this.
