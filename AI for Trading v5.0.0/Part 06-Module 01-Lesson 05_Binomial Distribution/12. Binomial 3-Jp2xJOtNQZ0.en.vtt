00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now, I'm going to make it really difficult. I'm going to give you a coin--let's call it loaded.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So, the probability for heads will now be 0.8 and therefore the probability for tails is 0.2.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
To make it easier, assume only a 3 coin flips

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and ask the probability of heads coming up exactly once.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
What is that probability for the loaded coin that I gave you here.

00:00:26.000 --> 99:59:59.999
I recommend answering it using a truth table.
