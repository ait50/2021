00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So let me give you the mathematical formula that you might be familiar with.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:23.000
n! for any number n is the same as n(n-1)(n-2) all the way to times 1.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Let's call it factorial. So 10 factorial for example will be 109876 and so on.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
If you look at this equation over here, I'll give you a couple of choices how to write it.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:48.000
It could be n!; it could be n!/k! where this over here is k which is 5

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and this over here is n.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It could be n!/k!*k! or it could be n!/k!*(n-k)!

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
These are four choices. One of this is actually correct for the formula

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
that we've computed before.

00:01:12.000 --> 99:59:59.999
Pick the correct one.
