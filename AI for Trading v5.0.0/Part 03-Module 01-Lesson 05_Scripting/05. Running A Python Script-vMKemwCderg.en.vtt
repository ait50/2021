00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.955
Now that you've successfully installed Python,

00:00:02.955 --> 00:00:06.169
let's try to run a script in your terminal.

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:09.689
First, download the file first_script.py

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:14.334
attached at the bottom of this page and move it to an appropriate directory.

00:00:14.335 --> 00:00:19.190
I put my file here by dragging it from the downloads folder to this folder.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.075
This might be a good time to set up

00:00:21.074 --> 00:00:24.730
a new directory for your learning if you don't have one already.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.600
Next, open your terminal and use CD

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.340
to navigate to the directory containing the downloaded file.

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:38.070
I can double check that the file is located here by typing ls or dir on Windows.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.409
Now that you're in the directory with the file,

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:43.319
you can run it by typing python followed by

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.304
the name of the file like this. Then press enter.

00:00:47.304 --> 00:00:51.134
You'll know you've run the scripts successfully if you see this message.

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:55.844
Whenever you type Python followed by the file name for a Python script,

00:00:55.844 --> 00:01:00.664
that script is run and the output is shown immediately afterwards.

00:01:00.664 --> 00:01:02.429
Once the codes finished running,

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:04.379
and all the output has been shown,

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.074
your command line prompt reappears.

00:01:07.075 --> 00:01:10.920
Note if you typed and entered just Python without a script to run,

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.340
it'll start an interactive interpreter for Python.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.480
You'll learn more about this later.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.885
For now, you can just type in exit with parentheses to get out or alternatively,

00:01:21.885 --> 00:01:27.719
control D on Mac and Linux or control Z and enter on Windows.

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:30.269
Now, I'm back to the command line prompt.

00:01:30.269 --> 00:01:35.000
It's your turn. Download the file below and run the script in your terminal.
