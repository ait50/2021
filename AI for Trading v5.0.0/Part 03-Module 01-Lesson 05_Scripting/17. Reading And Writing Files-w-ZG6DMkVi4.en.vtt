00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
In order for a program to be really useful,

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.254
it needs to interact with real-world data.

00:00:06.254 --> 00:00:11.370
Images, web pages, and databases are all examples of files,

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:14.070
and we routinely create, move,

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.925
manipulate, and read these files in our daily digital lives.

00:00:17.925 --> 00:00:21.420
All the data we've used so far has been defined inside

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.820
the Python script or raw input from the user during execution of the script.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.890
Next, we're going to massively increase the variety of what we can achieve in

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.155
our Python programming by introducing how to read and write files in Python.

00:00:37.155 --> 00:00:40.425
This will allow us to interact with and process

00:00:40.424 --> 00:00:44.070
larger amounts of information from many more sources.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.895
All kinds of files have a similar structure on a computer.

00:00:47.895 --> 00:00:51.930
There are strings of characters that encode some information.

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:53.969
The specific file format,

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.448
often indicated by the extension of the file name such as.py,

00:00:58.448 --> 00:01:02.730
TXT, HTM, CSV, and many more,

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:06.224
will indicate how those characters are organized.

00:01:06.224 --> 00:01:09.059
The characters in a file are interpreted by

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.225
the various programs we use to interact with them.

00:01:12.224 --> 00:01:15.299
For example, an image editing program will interpret

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.620
the information of a digital photograph file and display the image.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.275
If we then edit the image in the program,

00:01:22.275 --> 00:01:26.535
were using this program to make changes to the characters in the file.

00:01:26.534 --> 00:01:30.159
In Python, we can read those file characters directly.

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:35.344
The experience will seem quite different from opening a file in a desktop application.

00:01:35.344 --> 00:01:38.105
Opening files in Python gives us

00:01:38.105 --> 00:01:41.240
a common programmatic interface to all kinds of

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:44.824
files without the need for a graphical user interface,

00:01:44.825 --> 00:01:49.500
which means we can automate tasks involving files with Python programs.
