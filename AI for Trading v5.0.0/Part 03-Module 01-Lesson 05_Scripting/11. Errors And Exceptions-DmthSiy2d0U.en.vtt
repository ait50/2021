00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.609
As you saw in the last video,

00:00:02.609 --> 00:00:05.730
trying to handle every kind of scenario when

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.330
dealing with unexpected input can be a bit much.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.080
There's actually a much simpler way of dealing with this in Python.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.570
Here, you learn how to handle errors with try and except blocks.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.644
First, let's learn more about what errors in Python are.

00:00:22.644 --> 00:00:26.429
We've seen error messages due to several reasons in this course,

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:29.195
and we can separate them into two types,

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:32.075
syntax errors and exceptions.

00:00:32.075 --> 00:00:35.450
Syntax errors occur when Python can't interpret

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.850
our code since we didn't follow the correct syntax for Python.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.484
These are errors you're likely to get when you make a typo,

00:00:43.484 --> 00:00:45.585
or you're first starting to learn Python.

00:00:45.585 --> 00:00:48.149
Here, I get a syntax error because I

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.269
missed the ending quotation mark at the end of the string.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.325
I can see this in the error message,

00:00:53.325 --> 00:00:57.680
SyntaxError: End of line when scanning string literal.

00:00:57.679 --> 00:00:58.979
The other kind of error,

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:04.409
exceptions occur when unexpected things happen during the execution of the code.

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.694
Here, although our code is syntactically correct,

00:01:07.694 --> 00:01:11.114
we run into an exception because a string spelling out

00:01:11.114 --> 00:01:14.899
10 isn't a valid argument for the int function.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.045
There are different types of built-in exceptions in Python,

00:01:18.045 --> 00:01:22.769
and you can see which exception is being thrown here in the error message.

00:01:22.769 --> 00:01:25.694
Value error is one type of exception.

00:01:25.694 --> 00:01:29.879
It occurs when a built-in operation or function is

00:01:29.879 --> 00:01:34.539
given an argument with the correct type but an inappropriate value.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.300
Here's another example that there was an exception.

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.489
Here, we try to reference a variable name that we didn't define yet.

00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:44.114
So, we get a name error exception.

00:01:44.114 --> 00:01:47.399
Again, this code is syntactically correct,

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.150
but when Python gets to this line of code,

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.590
it can't find the value for this variable when it tries to run it.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.530
So, it raises an exception and stops the code.
