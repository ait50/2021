00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.359
Here, the code in the except block occurs

00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:07.264
when any kind of exception occurs while executing the try block.

00:00:07.264 --> 00:00:11.309
Really though we just want to adjust the ValueError exception.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.600
If I try to exit the program with Ctrl C,

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.364
it doesn't stop the program because the except handles any error,

00:00:19.364 --> 00:00:21.664
including the KeyboardInterrupt error.

00:00:21.664 --> 00:00:26.280
We can actually specify which error we want to handle like this.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.770
Now it catches the ValueError exception,

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.745
but not other exceptions like KeyboardInterrupt.

00:00:31.745 --> 00:00:34.814
Notice in this case when I press Ctrl C,

00:00:34.814 --> 00:00:36.809
it ends the program.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.185
This is because a KeyboardInterrupt exception was raised,

00:00:40.185 --> 00:00:43.350
which isn't handled by this try statement.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.215
Also notice that although the program crashed,

00:00:46.215 --> 00:00:50.010
this code in the finally block was still executed.

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:55.585
Attempted Input is printed no matter what as the program is exiting this try statement,

00:00:55.585 --> 00:00:57.945
even if that means exiting the program.

00:00:57.945 --> 00:01:02.115
If we want this handler to address more than one type of exception,

00:01:02.115 --> 00:01:06.915
we can include a tuple after the except with the exception like this.

00:01:06.915 --> 00:01:11.865
Or if we want to execute different blocks of code depending on the exception,

00:01:11.864 --> 00:01:15.015
you can have multiple except blocks like this.

00:01:15.015 --> 00:01:17.349
Here, I have two handlers,

00:01:17.349 --> 00:01:20.559
one for ValueError and one for KeyboardInterrupt.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.795
When I press Ctrl C,

00:01:22.795 --> 00:01:26.890
it says No input taken and breaks from the while loop.
