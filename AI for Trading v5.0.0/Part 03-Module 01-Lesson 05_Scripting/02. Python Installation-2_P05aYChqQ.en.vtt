00:00:02.859 --> 00:00:05.599
In all of the previous lessons,

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:09.619
we've been using these boxes to represent a code editor where

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:13.844
we wrote our Python code and output window where we viewed results.

00:00:13.845 --> 00:00:15.245
And in the classroom,

00:00:15.244 --> 00:00:18.705
you use these programming quizzes to write Python and run

00:00:18.705 --> 00:00:22.850
your code but instead of running your code online in the classroom,

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.240
you can run Python on your own computer by installing

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:29.989
Python and useful tools for your programming environment.

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:33.394
Since Python is a popular open-source programming language,

00:00:33.395 --> 00:00:34.700
it's free to download,

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.140
change and use and the fact that it's already popular means

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.240
there are online instructions to help you get it

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.150
installed for most common operating systems.

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.949
Because it's popular and open-source,

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.660
there's a large global community working on developing Python.

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:52.669
For you, as a Python user,

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.760
that means there'll be new versions coming out as Python is improved by the community.

00:00:57.759 --> 00:01:02.299
You might find yourself needing to update Python from time to time especially if you're

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:04.640
collaborating with other people as you write

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.534
Python programs that are compatible with the version they're using.

00:01:08.534 --> 00:01:11.000
Now, it's time for you to install Python.
