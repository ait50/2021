00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
I remember my first time reading a 10k.

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.790
My immediate impression was "wow",

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.564
this document is long and complicated.

00:00:08.564 --> 00:00:13.859
These extra complication exists because companies are required by law to disclose

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:18.675
potential risks and problems in detail so that down the road,

00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:21.644
they won't be liable for deceptive reporting.

00:00:21.644 --> 00:00:24.839
The level of complexity of the texts might then

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:28.214
be related to potential risk factors for the company.

00:00:28.214 --> 00:00:31.859
How do we quantify the complexity of a document?

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.060
One way to capture the complexity of a document is by calculating

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:42.295
readability indices that capture how easy a given text or document is for reading.

00:00:42.295 --> 00:00:47.885
The readability indices are constructed based on two heuristic observations.

00:00:47.884 --> 00:00:54.739
The first one, longer sentences tend to be less readable and the second one,

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.625
longer words tend to be less readable.

00:00:57.625 --> 00:01:00.710
The length of words can be calculated by the number of

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.825
syllables or roughly the number of distinct sounds in each word.

00:01:05.825 --> 00:01:08.405
With this observations in mind,

00:01:08.405 --> 00:01:11.930
we can construct two common readability indices.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.775
The first one, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Index given by the equation here,

00:01:18.775 --> 00:01:22.115
which combines the average length of sentences

00:01:22.114 --> 00:01:25.554
and average syllable counts of all the words.

00:01:25.555 --> 00:01:29.870
The second one, the Gunning-Fog Index that

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.460
combines the average length of sentences and the fraction of hard words,

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:40.224
where hard words are defined as words having three syllables or more.

00:01:40.224 --> 00:01:44.809
These indices are constructed heuristically so that they roughly

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.615
corresponds to the education level required for reading the underlying document.

00:01:50.614 --> 00:01:53.569
This readability metrics are commonly used by

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:57.694
researchers and educators to assess reading abilities.

00:01:57.694 --> 00:02:01.009
For example, young adult novels like

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.615
the Harry Potter series will have an average grade level of about eight

00:02:05.614 --> 00:02:08.509
to 10 while an academic paper in

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.134
theoretical Physics could easily have grade level beyond 16.

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:16.729
What about financial documents?

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:20.689
