00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.669
So far, we have considered metrics that are focused on individual documents.

00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:09.404
Given that financial documents are released periodically,

00:00:09.404 --> 00:00:14.474
it will be useful to quantify changes of these documents over time.

00:00:14.474 --> 00:00:20.820
We could simply track the readability index or negative sentiments over time.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.440
But this metrics tend to capture one specific feature of a document.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.105
It would be nice to find a way to directly compare two documents.

00:00:30.105 --> 00:00:35.429
Why is this useful? Well, a significant change in financial documents from

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:40.795
one period to the next might indicate changes in the market or company structure,

00:00:40.795 --> 00:00:45.035
and could lead to extra risks for the underlying stock.

00:00:45.034 --> 00:00:47.899
How do we compare the two documents?

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.554
This is where similarity metrics come in.

00:00:50.554 --> 00:00:56.284
This metrics convert two documents into a number representing the degree of similarity.

00:00:56.284 --> 00:00:58.054
To construct these metrics,

00:00:58.054 --> 00:01:01.024
we can use TF-IDF.

00:01:01.024 --> 00:01:05.840
We can convert a document into a list of TF-IDF weights,

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.034
which converts each document into a vector.

00:01:09.034 --> 00:01:11.015
Now that we have vectors,

00:01:11.015 --> 00:01:14.480
we can use linear algebra to construct this matrix.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.630
One common metric, is the cosine similarity.

00:01:17.629 --> 00:01:21.454
Think of two documents as two vectors in space.

00:01:21.454 --> 00:01:27.125
The cosine similarity is simply the cosine of the angle between the two vectors.

00:01:27.125 --> 00:01:30.109
Mathematically, this is the dot product of

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:33.679
the two vectors divided by the product of their length.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.595
You might ask, why do we use the angle instead of say,

00:01:37.594 --> 00:01:39.739
the distance between the two vectors?

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:44.569
This is because the concept of length doesn't really make sense intuitively.

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:49.384
So, using angles removes the dependence on the length of vectors.

00:01:49.385 --> 00:01:53.165
Another common metric, is the Jaccard similarity metric.

00:01:53.165 --> 00:01:58.835
We can understand it intuitively by thinking of each vector as a histogram.

00:01:58.834 --> 00:02:03.214
Here we see each vector or histogram in the same plot.

00:02:03.215 --> 00:02:07.719
Then, we construct the new histogram by comparing them.

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:10.090
To construct the minimum histogram,

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.289
we take the minimum of the two.

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:16.984
Then, we construct the maximum histogram by comparing the two.

00:02:16.985 --> 00:02:19.835
If vectors u and v are the same,

00:02:19.835 --> 00:02:23.485
the minimum and maximum histogram will be the same.

00:02:23.485 --> 00:02:26.570
The Jaccard similarity, is simply the volume of

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.574
the min histogram over the volume of the max histogram.

00:02:30.574 --> 00:02:34.594
There is another way of interpreting the Jaccard similarity.

00:02:34.594 --> 00:02:37.099
We can think of the histograms as sets.

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.250
So, the volume of the minimum histogram can also be

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.050
thought of as the volume of the intersection of the two sets.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.540
Similarly, the volume of the maximum histogram can be

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:50.629
thought of as the volume of the union of the two sets.

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:55.069
The Jaccard similarity can be rewritten as the size

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.900
of the intersection of the two sets over the size of the union of the two sets.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.219
Now, there are many other similarity metrics we haven't covered.

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:06.199
Some are based on heuristics,

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:11.209
like the minimal number of edits to transform one document into another document.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.420
This metrics may or may not be useful,

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:17.589
and I encourage you to explore them and experiment.
