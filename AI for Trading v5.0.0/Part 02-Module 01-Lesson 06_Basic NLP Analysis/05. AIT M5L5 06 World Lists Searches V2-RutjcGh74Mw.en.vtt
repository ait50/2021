00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
Now that we've learned how to harvest our bag of words, what can we do with it?

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.794
As a simple next step,

00:00:06.794 --> 00:00:09.210
we could categorize our bags.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.865
Not all apples are created equal.

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:14.894
Some may be good and some may be bad.

00:00:14.894 --> 00:00:19.259
For instance, words like loss, bankruptcy,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.480
and damage are likely to indicate negative problems,

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.580
so we can move them to the negative pile.

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:29.339
Words like great, breakthrough,

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:33.149
and innovation are associated with positive conditions,

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.060
so we can move them to the positive pile.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.234
We can perform this procedure systematically using a wordlist.

00:00:41.234 --> 00:00:46.744
So, all the words matching the word list can be moved to their corresponding categories.

00:00:46.744 --> 00:00:50.149
In the end, we can get a sentiment score by

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.945
computing the proportion of words matching our wordlist.

00:00:53.945 --> 00:00:56.450
In addition to positive or negative,

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.030
there could also be other possible categories,

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.895
like law-related or uncertain.

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:05.525
You may even come up with other brand new categories.

00:01:05.525 --> 00:01:08.109
So, where do we find this wordlist?

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:12.384
Researchers have compiled different wordlists for analyzing documents,

00:01:12.384 --> 00:01:17.329
and you can find some examples in the links we've included below the video.

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:23.009
Although, the best wordlist may be ones that are tailored specifically to your needs.
