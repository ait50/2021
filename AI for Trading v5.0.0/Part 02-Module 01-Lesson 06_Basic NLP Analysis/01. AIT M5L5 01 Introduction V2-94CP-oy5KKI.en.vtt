00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
In this lesson, we will learn different ways of

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.030
converting text in financial statements into

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:12.629
quantitative data so that they may be used as input for developing trading strategies.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.644
We will mainly focus on three frequently used metrics for financial analysis.

00:00:18.644 --> 00:00:21.089
The first one, readability.

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:23.640
How easy is the text for reading.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.280
The second, sentiments.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.700
How positive or negative the text is.

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.564
And the third one, similarity.

00:00:32.564 --> 00:00:36.449
That describes changes of periodic documents over time.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.970
In the next three lessons,

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.134
we'll we'll take a look at each of these items individually,

00:00:42.134 --> 00:00:44.869
and you will implement your own Python code to

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:48.094
compute these variables on real 10-K documents.

00:00:48.094 --> 00:00:50.670
Are you ready? Let's get started.
