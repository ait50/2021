00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
When analyzing a financial document,

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.035
we can gain deeper insights looking at the word compositions.

00:00:07.035 --> 00:00:11.164
For instance, a document filled with words like lawsuits,

00:00:11.164 --> 00:00:17.684
risks, losses, bankruptcy, might be indicative of problems within the company.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:20.434
How do we quantify this information?

00:00:20.434 --> 00:00:24.960
This can be done by condensing a document into a bag of words.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.210
Reviewing the bag of words concept,

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.839
we can imagine a document or a sentence as shown

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:34.835
here as an apple tree and the words as apples on the tree.

00:00:34.835 --> 00:00:40.954
That is, after all the pre-processing steps like lemmatization and stop-word removal,

00:00:40.954 --> 00:00:45.320
then we can harvest the apples into a bag of words.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.070
There is a potential issue with bag of words though.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.429
Since the bag of words ignore word orders.

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:55.655
For example, consider the following sentence,

00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:58.600
"No employees have left the company."

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.500
Now compare that to the next sentence,

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.394
"The company has no employees left."

00:01:04.394 --> 00:01:09.319
These two sentences have exactly the same words in different order.

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:14.404
So they have the same bag of words but completely opposite meaning.

00:01:14.405 --> 00:01:19.325
Another issue with bag of words is that for a long document there could be

00:01:19.325 --> 00:01:24.454
many different words which could lead to a large number of bags.

00:01:24.454 --> 00:01:29.900
These might dilute the amount of useful information in the bag of words framework.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.910
Despite these shortfalls, bag of words is useful because of its simplicity,

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.859
and it's a good starting point for learning more complex analysis methods.
