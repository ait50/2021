Congratulations on finishing this lesson.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.629
Now you know how to use bag-of-words to analyze documents

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.785
to see how similar they are and see if a company is doing well or not.

00:00:10.785 --> 00:00:16.019
Now, you will apply everything you learned in this lesson to the project to

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:20.774
actually do this for a real 10-K. Good luck in the project.

00:00:20.774 --> 00:00:23.799
I will see you all in lesson six.
