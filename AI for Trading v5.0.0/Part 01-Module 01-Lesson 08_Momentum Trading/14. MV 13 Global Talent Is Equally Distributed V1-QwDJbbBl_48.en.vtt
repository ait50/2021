00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
We believe that the community of students who are taking

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.609
this nanodegree are doing more than just getting

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.595
themselves ready to enter the quant trading industry.

00:00:08.595 --> 00:00:11.700
You and your community of classmates are helping us to

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:15.724
prove that talent exists in every corner of the world.

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:20.269
I have to admit that from the outside of the finance world there's a sense that

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:25.445
banking and finance tends to be more suited for students from elite universities,

00:00:25.445 --> 00:00:28.155
but when we step inside the financial industry,

00:00:28.155 --> 00:00:32.149
we actually see that there are people from all kinds of backgrounds,

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.729
former nonprofit policy analysts,

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:39.339
chemists, and also very successful people who never got a college degree.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.270
So, I think that your community of classmates are collectively setting out to prove

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.180
that no matter where you're from or what your parents did or what school you went to,

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:52.920
you have the capability to find Alpha.
