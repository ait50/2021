00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.540
Formulating trading strategies often starts with an observation.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.310
A pattern that seems to be recurring in the market over time.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.710
At that point, your creativity and

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.105
intuition tell you that there might be an opportunity for monetization.

00:00:15.105 --> 00:00:17.504
Your job as a contrator then,

00:00:17.504 --> 00:00:20.338
is to turn this observation into an expression,

00:00:20.338 --> 00:00:25.849
both mathematically and programmatically and verify it using historical data.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.335
This is alpha research.

00:00:28.335 --> 00:00:33.240
Statistical analysis lets you very quickly and scientifically test whether

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.300
an observed pattern or trading signal that you come up

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:40.379
with has the potential to turn into a profitable trading strategy.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.070
Once this is proven,

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.545
then you can proceed to define your trading strategy in a more detailed manner.

00:00:46.545 --> 00:00:49.414
Which will lead to a full back-testing exercise,

00:00:49.414 --> 00:00:52.359
as the last step of the research process.

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:54.414
As a point of clarification,

00:00:54.414 --> 00:00:59.884
the Alpha of the t-test is not the same as the Alpha in Alpha analysis.

00:00:59.884 --> 00:01:04.409
The same Greek symbols are just used to represent many different things.

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.109
Later in the program,

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:08.689
we shall look more closely at the caveats and

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.920
techniques of finding trading signals using time series.
