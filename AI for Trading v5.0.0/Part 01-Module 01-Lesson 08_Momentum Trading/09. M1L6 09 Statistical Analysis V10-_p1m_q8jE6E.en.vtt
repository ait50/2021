00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.049
Now we are ready to perform our analysis.

00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:05.459
The resulting returns time series is

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:09.254
the theoretical monthly performance of our long-short portfolio.

00:00:09.255 --> 00:00:13.750
Our goal is to see if the mean monthly return is greater than zero.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.599
Let's calculate that.

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.789
So, our mean is indeed greater than zero at 0.53 percent,

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.089
but does this mean that we got this value because

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:27.519
on average this trading strategy yields positive returns?

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:31.335
That is to say that the true mean is greater than zero?

00:00:31.335 --> 00:00:36.000
It could be that on average this trading strategy will not yield positive returns.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.789
Maybe the true mean is less than or equal to zero,

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:41.689
and this value is just a random fluctuation.

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:47.474
Well, one approach to assess this is to perform a statistical test on our hypothesis.

00:00:47.475 --> 00:00:52.715
A t-test is a way of testing the probability of getting as bigger mean as we did,

00:00:52.715 --> 00:00:57.980
assuming all the assumptions we made to build our model of strategy returns were correct.

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:01.640
In our case, we can compute the t-statistic by dividing

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.775
the mean return x bar by the standard error of the mean SE x bar.

00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:10.400
Using this t-statistic, we can measure the probability

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.880
of getting a mean monthly return of 0.53 percent or

00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:16.949
larger if the true mean monthly return is

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.655
zero given that the assumptions we made to build our model are correct.

00:01:21.655 --> 00:01:24.364
This probability is called the p-value.

00:01:24.364 --> 00:01:26.829
If the probability is very small,

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:30.879
we might infer that it's unlikely that the true mean is zero.

00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:33.079
Now, before running the test,

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.799
we should decide how small the p-value needs to

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.405
be for us to conclude that the true mean is not zero.

00:01:39.405 --> 00:01:41.219
To denote this threshold,

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:44.025
we usually use the Greek symbol alpha.

00:01:44.025 --> 00:01:47.325
A commonly used value is 0.1.

00:01:47.325 --> 00:01:51.005
Setting alpha sets the false positive rate for the test.

00:01:51.004 --> 00:01:53.849
So, if we set alpha equals 0.1,

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:57.158
we're effectively saying that if we use this threshold,

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.690
we are incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis when the true mean

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.795
is zero in 10 percent of many hypothetical users of this test.

00:02:06.795 --> 00:02:09.409
By performing a one-tail t-test on

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:11.659
the alternative hypothesis that the mean of

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:14.629
these returns is statistically greater than zero,

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.129
we calculate the p-value with

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:21.219
the stats package using a degrees of freedom of n minus one equals 47,

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:25.495
and we find that the t-statistic is about 1.618,

00:02:25.495 --> 00:02:28.875
with the p-value of 0.0566.

00:02:28.875 --> 00:02:34.129
Meaning that the result is not significant at P less than 0.05 level,

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:37.254
but insignificant at P less than 0.1.

00:02:37.254 --> 00:02:40.609
This means that we are fairly unlikely to get a mean of

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.390
0.53 percent if the true mean is zero.

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:46.909
This result shows some initial promise

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:50.159
that there could be some alpha contained in the strategy,

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.859
and thus serves as a quick sanity check to justify investigating further and

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.925
fine-tuning the strategy leading to a full backtesting exercise in the end.

00:02:59.925 --> 00:03:03.030
If we measure the monthly performance of the SPDR,

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.735
S&amp;P 500 ETF, SPY over the same period,

00:03:06.735 --> 00:03:11.065
we would find that the mean monthly return is 0.83 percent,

00:03:11.064 --> 00:03:13.859
which is actually greater than that of the strategy,

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.155
at least at this preliminary stage.

00:03:16.155 --> 00:03:20.180
To be clear, comparing our momentum strategy to the strategy of

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.175
investing directly in S&amp;P 500 ETF is not really a fair comparison.

00:03:25.175 --> 00:03:27.660
These are two very different strategies.

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:31.323
For one thing, ours involves taking long and short positions,

00:03:31.324 --> 00:03:35.330
while investing in the S&amp;P only involves taking long positions.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:41.770
However, this gives us a vague idea of what values portfolio returns might take.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.330
Also, while our strategy's obviously simplistic to begin with,

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.860
this shows that it is actually not

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.820
an easy task to find a strategy that can outperform the market.

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.719
Note that if you get a very large p-value at this early stage,

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:59.569
you wouldn't want to go back and make meaningless changes to

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.430
your strategy like changing a parameter a little until you got a very low p-value.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.610
Doing this is called data snooping or p-hacking,

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.250
and would just fine tune your strategy to exploit

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.090
the particular random fluctuations in the dataset you have.

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.014
A strategy device that way would be unlikely to perform well on future data.

00:04:19.014 --> 00:04:23.159
What you should do instead is make meaningful changes to your strategy.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.860
In other words, you should come up with

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.600
a different idea for a strategy and test that instead.
