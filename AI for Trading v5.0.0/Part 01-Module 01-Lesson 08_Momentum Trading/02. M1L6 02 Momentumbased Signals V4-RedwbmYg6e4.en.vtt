00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.689
Newton's first law of motion states that an object at rest stays at rest,

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:12.009
and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction,

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.219
unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.399
While Newton's laws may seem to have little to do with the vagaries of the stock market,

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:24.884
a similar behavior is often noted in security prices, that is,

00:00:24.885 --> 00:00:28.590
rising stock prices seem to continue to rise for some time,

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.589
while falling stock prices continue to fall.

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:35.755
This observed phenomenon is popularly known as momentum.

00:00:35.755 --> 00:00:38.780
But, stocks are not like physical objects,

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.579
so what causes this effect?

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:42.875
Honestly, no one really knows.

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:47.715
There are several factors that seem to contribute to it including human behavior.

00:00:47.715 --> 00:00:50.840
People don't want to miss out on an opportunity to make money,

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.610
and tend to follow the heart.

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:55.744
People also tend to under-react to news.

00:00:55.744 --> 00:01:01.445
New information propagates over time leading to a prolonged effect on stock prices.

00:01:01.445 --> 00:01:06.650
There is a branch of trading strategies that attempts to capitalize on such trends,

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.275
and while there is no standard method to quantify momentum signals,

00:01:11.275 --> 00:01:16.790
a few common techniques include: technical indicators such as moving averages,

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.380
large price movements with volume,

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:21.839
and stocks making new highs.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.189
In the next section,

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.269
we shall look at one example momentum strategy and

00:01:26.269 --> 00:01:29.679
evaluate its potential using statistical analysis.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.055
The general premise of this trading signal is that,

00:01:33.055 --> 00:01:37.385
out-performing stocks tend to keep their momentum and continue to remain

00:01:37.385 --> 00:01:39.710
out-performers for some more time in

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:43.379
a particular market and vice versa for under-performers.

00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:47.179
If you believe in momentum being a repeating market phenomenon,

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.040
it may be a good opportunity to buy out performers and sell under-performers,

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.730
capitalizing on the continuation of their movement.
