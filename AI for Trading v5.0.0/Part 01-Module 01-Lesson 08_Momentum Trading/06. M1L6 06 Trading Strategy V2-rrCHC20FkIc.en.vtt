00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.054
Here's how you might approach the problem of formulating the complete trading strategy.

00:00:05.054 --> 00:00:10.019
Our goal is to construct a stock portfolio of long and short positions,

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.740
and the selection process for stocks to go into the portfolio is

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.714
based on the stock's returns performance relative to other stocks.

00:00:17.714 --> 00:00:19.679
For this example, we shall assume

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:24.855
we are periodically re-evaluating and re-balancing stock holdings every month-end.

00:00:24.855 --> 00:00:27.754
Let's use the S&amp;P stocks universe.

00:00:27.754 --> 00:00:33.405
The top 500 stocks trading in the US tracked by the S&amp;P 500 index.

00:00:33.405 --> 00:00:37.640
A stock universe, is a general term in finance that refers to

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.689
a group of stocks that share certain common features,

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:45.049
belong to the same market or simply a set of stocks that

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:48.625
are used in verifying or simulating trading strategies.

00:00:48.625 --> 00:00:54.210
First, we fetch the daily closing prices of each toxins mid-2013.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.990
Please note that it is important that we use

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.134
adjusted closing prices for analysis purposes.

00:01:00.134 --> 00:01:04.640
Also note that the composition of stock universes changes over time.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.510
For example, around 10 to 40 companies leave or enter the S&amp;P 500 every year.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.090
When you test your strategy,

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.829
it is important that your dataset for 2013 for example,

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:19.724
contained the companies that were part of the universe in 2013.

00:01:19.724 --> 00:01:22.849
In fact, your dataset for any point in time,

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:26.579
should contain the companies that were in the universe at that time.

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:29.269
If you use the current composition for example,

00:01:29.269 --> 00:01:32.435
the current S&amp;P 500 index in 2017,

00:01:32.435 --> 00:01:35.344
then you will effectively be testing your strategy

00:01:35.343 --> 00:01:39.004
on the subset of stocks that survive to 2017.

00:01:39.004 --> 00:01:42.739
These stocks probably performed better than the ones that left the universe.

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:46.819
So the performance of your strategy will look better than it should.

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:49.939
This is a subtle error that analysts often make,

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.284
and is known as survivorship bias.

00:01:52.284 --> 00:01:55.969
Now, since we are only interested in month-end prices,

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:00.355
we can re-sample the daily closing prices into monthly prices,

00:02:00.355 --> 00:02:05.150
then we can form a log returns time-series from the monthly prices.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.060
For each month-end observation period,

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.750
we rank the stocks by their month-end returns from the highest to the lowest.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.419
Select the top performing end stocks into

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:20.194
our long portfolio and the bottom performing end stocks into our short portfolio.

00:02:20.194 --> 00:02:23.055
You could also choose a fraction of stock say,

00:02:23.055 --> 00:02:25.290
the top and bottom 10 percent.

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:27.239
To simplify this example,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.270
we'll assume every stock gets an equal dollar amount of investment.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.610
This makes it easier to compute the portfolios monthly returns

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.020
performance as the simple arithmetic average of the stock returns.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.710
Lastly, the combined portfolios monthly returns is

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.189
the difference between the long portfolio's return and that of the short portfolio.

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:50.090
Now, continue doing this for each month and

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.530
period and you have a momentum based trading strategy.
