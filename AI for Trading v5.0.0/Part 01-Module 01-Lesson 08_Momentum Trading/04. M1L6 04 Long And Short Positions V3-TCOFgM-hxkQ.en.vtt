00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.915
Once you have found a signal that seems to indicate the future performance of a stock,

00:00:04.915 --> 00:00:06.919
it is time to put it to action.

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:10.560
For instance, if you think that a stock has upward momentum,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.120
you might want to buy some shares and hold onto it for a fixed period of time,

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:17.484
or until you start seeing the stock fall.

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:20.769
This is known as taking a long position on the stock.

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:22.794
When you sell your stock, hopefully,

00:00:22.795 --> 00:00:24.545
at a higher price than you bought it,

00:00:24.545 --> 00:00:27.030
that is known as closing your position.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.770
But what if the stock has a downward momentum?

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:33.289
And you believe that it is going to keep falling for some time?

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:37.585
In this case, you can take what is known as a short position on the stock,

00:00:37.585 --> 00:00:40.225
selling first and then buying back later,

00:00:40.225 --> 00:00:42.024
hopefully, at a lower price.

00:00:42.024 --> 00:00:45.289
If this is the first time you're hearing about shorting,

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:46.984
it might sound bewildering.

00:00:46.984 --> 00:00:50.619
But what it boils down to is borrowing shares from someone,

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:52.939
usually your broker, and then promising to

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:55.734
return them once your short position is closed.

00:00:55.734 --> 00:00:58.865
The brokers incentive here is that they typically

00:00:58.865 --> 00:01:02.130
earn a commission on the profit you make from the short sale.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.760
At the same time, they are taking a risk.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.820
What if you bail out and never buy back the shares?

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:11.509
For this reason, brokers typically require you to keep some money in

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.885
a margin account that they can charge if you fail to keep your promise.

00:01:15.885 --> 00:01:20.420
The whole process of short selling is a bit more complex with interests,

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.790
fees, and margin calls coming into the picture.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.670
But, all you need to know when evaluating

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.594
a potential trading signal is that shorting is one possible action you can take.

00:01:30.594 --> 00:01:33.314
So, when you think a stock is going up,

00:01:33.314 --> 00:01:35.099
you can buy or go long,

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:38.604
and if you believe it is going to keep falling, you can short it.

00:01:38.605 --> 00:01:43.445
However, dealing with individual stocks can be tricky and unpredictable.

00:01:43.444 --> 00:01:46.254
You don't want to put all your eggs in one basket.

00:01:46.254 --> 00:01:50.629
Therefore, it is recommended to adopt a cross-sectional strategy,

00:01:50.629 --> 00:01:54.109
where you invest in multiple stocks at the same time.

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:59.450
One smart way to do this is to use your signal to rank order the stocks,

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.770
and use the rankings to select stocks for long and or short positions.

00:02:03.769 --> 00:02:06.858
For instance, if you're using a momentum signal,

00:02:06.858 --> 00:02:09.519
the top performers are likely to keep rising,

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.180
so you can go long on them,

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.705
and the bottom performers,

00:02:12.705 --> 00:02:15.400
that are falling, are likely to keep falling.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.159
So, you can short them.

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.219
This has the added benefit that you're using

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:22.270
the relative performance of stocks to compare them.
