00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
A trading strategy is a set of steps and

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.390
rules that help you decide what stocks to buy or sell,

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:10.274
when to perform these trades and how much money to invest in them.

00:00:10.275 --> 00:00:14.910
Designing a successful training strategy that reliably generates profits for

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.690
you while minimizing the risk of losing money is indeed a complex task,

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.320
but it starts with looking for signals that might

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.445
hold a clue about the future performance of stocks.

00:00:25.445 --> 00:00:26.765
You might be wondering,

00:00:26.765 --> 00:00:28.484
where do we find such signals?

00:00:28.484 --> 00:00:31.390
Is there a book that I can read? Well, yes.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.765
There are some ideas that have led to good strategies,

00:00:34.765 --> 00:00:36.825
but if an idea becomes popular,

00:00:36.825 --> 00:00:39.840
chances are, everyone will try to exploit it.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.940
In order to have a competitive advantage over other traders,

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:46.849
you should try and come up with your own ideas or variations.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.939
Your idea could be something simple.

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:51.559
For example, retail stocks rise during

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.965
the holiday shopping season or something more complicated,

00:00:54.965 --> 00:00:57.110
like oil stocks that deviate from

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.564
the oil sector index beyond a certain threshold are bound to fall back.

00:01:01.564 --> 00:01:03.474
Whatever your idea might be,

00:01:03.475 --> 00:01:06.469
it is important to treat it as a hypothesis

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:09.840
and test it against data to see if it holds up.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.680
This will allow you to build a strong foundation for your trading strategy.
