00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
So, let's do this calculation a bit more in detail.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.640
Since we have eight emails in total and three of them are

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:09.179
spam and five of them are non-spam or ham,

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:15.955
then our prior probabilities are three over eight for spam and five over eight for ham.

00:00:15.955 --> 00:00:18.829
So, onto calculate the posteriors.

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:20.529
Say we have a spam email,

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.005
since there are three of them and one contains the word easy and two don't.

00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:28.079
Then, the probability for containing the word easy is one-third,

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.129
and for not containing it is two-thirds, if you're spam.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.615
And as we had calculated before,

00:00:34.615 --> 00:00:38.340
the probability of containing the easy if your ham is

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.915
one-fifth and of not containing it if your ham is four-fifths.

00:00:42.914 --> 00:00:45.280
Now, by the rule of conditional probability,

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.630
probability of the email spam containing the word easy is the product of these two,

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.620
three over eight times one-third, which one-eighth.

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:55.219
In a similar way, we calculate the probability of being

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.204
spam and not containing the word easy, which is one-fourth.

00:00:58.204 --> 00:01:02.054
And probabilities of being ham containing the word easy is one-eighth,

00:01:02.054 --> 00:01:04.424
and not containing it is one-half.

00:01:04.424 --> 00:01:06.545
Now, this is where we apply Bayes' rule.

00:01:06.545 --> 00:01:08.590
We know that the email contains the word easy,

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.295
so our entire universe consists of only these two cases: when the is spam or ham.

00:01:14.295 --> 00:01:17.704
Those two have the same probability, one-eighth of happening.

00:01:17.704 --> 00:01:19.698
So, once we normalize the probabilities,

00:01:19.698 --> 00:01:22.935
they both turn into 50 percent.

00:01:22.935 --> 00:01:26.625
Thus, our two posterior probabilities are 50 percent.

00:01:26.625 --> 00:01:29.034
For ham emails, we can do the same procedure.

00:01:29.034 --> 00:01:33.114
Our prior are three over eight and five over eight as before.

00:01:33.114 --> 00:01:36.184
Our probabilities of containing the word money and not

00:01:36.185 --> 00:01:39.734
containing it are two-thirds and one-third for the spam emails,

00:01:39.734 --> 00:01:43.015
and one-fifth and four-fifths for the ham emails.

00:01:43.015 --> 00:01:46.484
Our products of probabilities are then one-quarter,

00:01:46.484 --> 00:01:49.545
one-quarter, one-eighth, and one-half.

00:01:49.545 --> 00:01:52.439
But since the email contains the word money,

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.424
then we only care about these two.

00:01:54.424 --> 00:01:57.644
Since one-fourth is twice as much as one-eighth,

00:01:57.644 --> 00:02:03.599
when we normalize them we get two-thirds or 66.7 percent for spam,

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:07.379
and one-third or 33.3 percent for ham.

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:10.000
These are the posteriors.
