00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.665
Now, here's where the word naive comes in Naive Bayes.

00:00:03.665 --> 00:00:06.765
We're going to make a pretty naive assumption here.

00:00:06.765 --> 00:00:09.505
Let's look at the probability of two events happening together,

00:00:09.505 --> 00:00:11.600
so P of A and B.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.090
We can also read this a P of A intersection B.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.935
And we're going to say that this is the product of P of A and P of B.

00:00:19.935 --> 00:00:22.770
Now, this only happens when the two events are independent.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.735
If they're not, then this is not true.

00:00:25.735 --> 00:00:28.260
For example, if A is the event of it being hot

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.395
outside and B is the event of it being cold outside,

00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:34.050
then they both have a positive probability.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.190
But now, what's the probability of both events happening at the same time?

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.570
This will be zero, since it can't be hot and cold at the same time.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.060
So, this formula doesn't follow because the events of

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.540
being hot and being cold are dependent on each other.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.360
But in a Naive Bayes, we will assume that our probabilities are independent.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.070
This, as we said, is a false and naive assumption,

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.675
but in practice, it works very well and it makes our algorithm very fast.

00:00:59.675 --> 00:01:03.000
Another formula I will use is a formula for conditional probability.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.024
These are two ways of writing P of A intersection B.

00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:08.775
And this is the basis for our base theorem.

00:01:08.775 --> 00:01:12.665
But the trick we'll use here is to forget about P of B.

00:01:12.665 --> 00:01:14.935
And now, we don't have these being equal.

00:01:14.935 --> 00:01:20.865
But we have P of A given B to be proportional to P of B given A times P of A.

00:01:20.865 --> 00:01:23.230
This will work very well because in the practice,

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.385
P of B will cancel out,

00:01:24.385 --> 00:01:27.738
so the fact that these two are proportional is very useful.

00:01:27.738 --> 00:01:29.315
And now, here's what we want.

00:01:29.315 --> 00:01:32.175
We have an email that contains the words easy and money,

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:34.125
and we want to know if it is spam.

00:01:34.125 --> 00:01:37.170
So we want this, the probability of the email being

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.020
spam given that it contains the words easy and money.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.600
We'll start by using a conditional probability rule that we just reviewed to write it as

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.970
a product of the probability that the email

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.400
contains the words easy and money given that it is spam,

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.555
times the probability of the email being spam.

00:01:54.555 --> 00:01:57.660
In this formula, A represents being

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.670
spam and B represents containing the words easy and money.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.235
Now, we are ready to use our naive assumption.

00:02:05.235 --> 00:02:08.280
This first factor over here is a probability of the email

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.775
containing the words easy and money given that it is spam.

00:02:11.775 --> 00:02:13.950
We can write it as a probability of

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.790
the email containing the word easy given that it is spam,

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.455
times the probability of the email containing the word money given that it is spam.

00:02:21.455 --> 00:02:24.725
Again, huge naive assumptions as these may be dependent.

00:02:24.725 --> 00:02:27.750
It could be that containing the word easy actually makes it more likely that

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.075
the email contains the word money. But that's okay.

00:02:31.075 --> 00:02:33.120
In many cases, this assumption won't affect

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.550
the results and it will make our calculations much easier.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.940
And this is the heart of the Naive Bayes algorithm.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.040
And now, we do the same thing for hand emails.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.575
We have both probabilities written as a product of factors.

00:02:46.575 --> 00:02:48.540
But what are these factors?

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.435
Well, we've calculated them before based on our data.

00:02:52.435 --> 00:02:56.040
The first one P of containing the word easy given that it is spam,

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.940
is one-third since there are three spam emails and one of them contains the word easy.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.420
For P of containing money given spam,

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.770
that's two-thirds since there are

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.995
three spam emails and two of them contain the word money.

00:03:07.995 --> 00:03:09.970
And P of spam is very simple.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.410
It's three over eight since there are eight emails and only three of them are spam.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.580
We do a similar calculation for the bottom one and get one-fifth,

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.550
one-fifth, and five over eight.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.760
Now we multiply them and we get that the probability of spam given

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.390
that it contains the word easy and money is proportional to one over 12.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.240
And for ham, it's proportional to one over 40.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.846
Now remember that these values are not the actual probabilities,

00:03:33.846 --> 00:03:36.210
they are proportional to the actual probabilities.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.515
So what do we do to get the actual probabilities? Here's the magic.

00:03:40.515 --> 00:03:43.405
We know that an email has to be either spam or ham,

00:03:43.405 --> 00:03:45.545
so these two should add to one.

00:03:45.545 --> 00:03:48.000
So we need to normalize them, namely,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.760
multiply them both by the same factor so that they are still

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.155
proportional to one over 12 and one over 40, but they add to one.

00:03:55.155 --> 00:03:59.910
Let's try that in a quiz. Can you find two numbers that add to one and that they are

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.445
in the same proportion to each other as one over 12 and one over 40?

00:04:04.445 --> 00:04:06.000
