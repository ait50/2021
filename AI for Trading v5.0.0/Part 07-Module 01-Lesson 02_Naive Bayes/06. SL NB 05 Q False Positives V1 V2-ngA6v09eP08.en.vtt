00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
Now, let's look at an interesting application of Bayes Theorem.

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.554
Let's say we're not feeling very well and we go to the doctor,

00:00:06.554 --> 00:00:09.844
the doctor says there's a terrible disease going on,

00:00:09.845 --> 00:00:11.669
I'll administer a test for you.

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:16.094
Moreover, she says that the test has 99 percent accuracy.

00:00:16.094 --> 00:00:20.070
More specifically, she says that for every 100 patients that are sick,

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.115
the test correctly diagnosis 99 of them and for every 100 patients that are healthy,

00:00:25.114 --> 00:00:27.984
the test correctly diagnosis 99 of them.

00:00:27.984 --> 00:00:31.994
If we want to be tactical, these are actually called sensitivity and specificity.

00:00:31.995 --> 00:00:33.884
Then while we're waiting for our test,

00:00:33.884 --> 00:00:36.699
we researched the Internet and find that on average,

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.585
one of every 10,000 people suffers from the disease.

00:00:40.585 --> 00:00:42.929
The next day the doctor calls with terrible news.

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:45.784
She says that we have tested positive for the disease,

00:00:45.784 --> 00:00:47.259
so now we're panicking.

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:50.579
But before panicking, let's turn to math and actually

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.439
calculate what is the probability of being sick. So here's a quiz.

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:59.195
Given the two pieces of information that the test has 99 percent accuracy,

00:00:59.195 --> 00:01:02.549
and that one out of every 10,000 people have the disease,

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:06.344
what do you think the probability is that we're sick?

00:01:06.344 --> 00:01:10.094
Is it from 0-20 percent, from 20-40,

00:01:10.094 --> 00:01:14.435
40-60, 60-80, or 80-100?

00:01:14.435 --> 00:01:17.070
Take your guess and enter it below.
