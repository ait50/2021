00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
So let's see. We have

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.500
three spam emails and one of them contains the word 'easy,' which means

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.245
the probability of an email containing the word 'easy' given that it's spam is one-third.

00:00:10.244 --> 00:00:14.160
Since two out of the three three spam emails containing the word 'money,' then

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.675
the probability of an email containing the word money given that it's spam is two-thirds.

00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:21.240
And similarly, since there are five ham emails

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:23.849
and one of them contains the word 'easy,' then

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.070
the probability of an email containing the word 'easy' given that it is ham is one-fifth.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.094
And same thing for the word 'money.'

00:00:31.094 --> 00:00:33.750
And the main gist of Bayesian learning is the following,

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.130
we go from what's known,

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.140
which is P of 'easy' given spam and P of 'money' given spam,

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.695
to what's inferred, which is P of

00:00:43.695 --> 00:00:47.609
spam given that it contains the word 'easy,' which is one-half,

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:52.590
since there are two emails containing the word 'easy' and only one of them is spam.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.229
And P of spam given that it contains the word 'money,' which is two-thirds

00:00:58.228 --> 00:01:03.869
since there are three emails containing the word 'money' and two of them are spam.
