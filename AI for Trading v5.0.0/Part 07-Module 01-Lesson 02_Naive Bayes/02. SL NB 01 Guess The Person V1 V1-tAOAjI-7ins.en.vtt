00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.370
We'll start with an example.

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:03.750
Let's say we're in an office and there are two people,

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.740
Alex and Brenda, and they're both there the same amount of time.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.505
When they were in the office and we see someone passing by really fast,

00:00:11.505 --> 00:00:13.110
we can't tell who it is,

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:14.830
but we'd like to take a guess.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.690
So far, with all we know,

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.789
all we can infer is that since they're both in the office the same amount of time,

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.339
the probability of the person being Alex is

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:28.064
50 percent and the probability of the person being Brenda is also 50 percent.

00:00:28.065 --> 00:00:30.720
But now, let's try to use more information so we

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:33.435
can make a better guess of who the person is.

00:00:33.435 --> 00:00:35.580
When we saw the person running by,

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.859
we notice that they were wearing a red sweater.

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:40.594
So, we'll use that piece of information.

00:00:40.594 --> 00:00:42.854
We've known Alex and Brenda for a while,

00:00:42.854 --> 00:00:46.859
and actually we've noticed that Alex wears a red sweater two days a week,

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:49.579
and Brenda wears a red sweater three days a week.

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.515
We don't know which days, but we are sure of this fact.

00:00:52.515 --> 00:00:54.480
Also, when we say week we mean workweek,

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:57.554
so five days, although at the end this won't matter much.

00:00:57.554 --> 00:00:59.189
So now what we'll do,

00:00:59.189 --> 00:01:03.104
is we'll use this piece of information to help us make a better guess.

00:01:03.104 --> 00:01:06.659
First off, since Alex wears a red sweater less than Brenda,

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.119
It's easy to imagine that it's a bit less likely that

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.060
the person we saw is Alex than that it is Brenda.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.894
But exactly how likely?

00:01:13.894 --> 00:01:17.509
Well, let's say that if we saw a person pass by five times,

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.560
it would make sense to think that two of this times it was Alex,

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.939
since he wears a red sweater twice a week.

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:24.789
And the other three times it was Brenda,

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.225
since she wears a red sweater three times a week.

00:01:27.224 --> 00:01:33.369
Therefore, from here we can infer that the probabilities are 40 and 60.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.600
We've used the formation about the color of the sweater to obtain

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:40.439
better probabilities about who was the person who passed by.

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.459
This is Bayes' theorem and we'll learn in more in detail in the next few videos.

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:47.534
The initial guess we had, the 50/50 guess,

00:01:47.534 --> 00:01:48.989
is called the prior,

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:53.640
since it's all we could infer prior to the new information about the red sweater.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.109
The final guess we have,

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:57.644
the 60/40 guess is called the posterior,

00:01:57.644 --> 00:02:01.399
since we've inferred it after the new information has arrived.
