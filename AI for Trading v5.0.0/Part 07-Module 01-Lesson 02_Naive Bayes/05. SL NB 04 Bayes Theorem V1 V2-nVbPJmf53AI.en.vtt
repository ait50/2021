00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
So, let's look at a formal version of Bayes Theorem.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.935
Initially, we start with an event,

00:00:04.934 --> 00:00:06.959
and this event could be A or B.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.414
The probabilities for each are here,

00:00:09.414 --> 00:00:12.029
P of A, and P of B.

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:14.339
Now, we observe a third event,

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:20.129
and that event can either happen or not happen both for A and for

00:00:20.129 --> 00:00:26.804
B. R is going to help us find more exact probabilities for A and B in the following way.

00:00:26.804 --> 00:00:31.864
Let's say we can calculate the probability of R given A,

00:00:31.864 --> 00:00:37.479
and also, of R complement which is node R given A.

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:40.169
And similarly for R given B,

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.270
and R complement given B.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.645
Now, our set of scenarios are these four,

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:48.585
R n A, R complement n A,

00:00:48.585 --> 00:00:52.064
R n B, and R complement n B.

00:00:52.064 --> 00:00:54.634
But since we know R occurred,

00:00:54.634 --> 00:00:57.929
then we know that the second and the fourth events are not possible.

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:01.719
So, our new universe consists of the two events,

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.250
R n A and R n B.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.454
We calculate the probability for A n R or equivalently A intersection R,

00:01:10.454 --> 00:01:12.640
and by the Law of Conditional Probability,

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.885
this is P of A times B of R given A.

00:01:15.885 --> 00:01:20.280
Similarly, for B intersection R. Now,

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.219
since these probabilities do not add to one,

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:26.099
we just divide them both by their sum so

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:29.684
that the new normalized probabilities now do add to one.

00:01:29.685 --> 00:01:34.394
Thus, we get the following formulas for P of A given R,

00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:37.920
and P of B given R. These are

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.530
our new and improved probabilities for A and B after we know that R occurred.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.180
Again, P of A and P of B are called the prior probabilities which is,

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.970
what we knew before we knew that R occurred.

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:53.849
P of A given R and P of B given R,

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:56.309
are posterior probabilities which is,

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.775
what we inferred after we knew that R occurred.

00:01:59.775 --> 00:02:01.500
And here it is,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.599
the formula for Bayes Theorem..
