Hello again and welcome to the Naive Bayes section.

00:00:03.265 --> 00:00:06.030
Naive Bayes is a more probabilistic algorithm which is based

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.096
on playing with the concept of conditional probability.

00:00:09.096 --> 00:00:13.305
This algorithm has great benefits such as being easy to implement and very fast to train.

00:00:13.305 --> 00:00:17.655
We'll be studying one of very interesting applications, natural language processing.

00:00:17.655 --> 00:00:19.080
In the lectures and in the lab,

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.460
we'll use it to analyze text,

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.440
and emails, and speeches.
