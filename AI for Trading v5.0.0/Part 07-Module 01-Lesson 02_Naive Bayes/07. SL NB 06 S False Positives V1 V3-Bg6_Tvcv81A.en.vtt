00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
Well, let's see. Let's use Bayes theorem to calculate it.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.285
We'll use the following notation,

00:00:05.285 --> 00:00:07.129
S will stand for sick,

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:09.025
H will stand for healthy,

00:00:09.025 --> 00:00:12.290
and the plus sign will stand for testing positive.

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:15.474
So since one out of every 10,000 people are sick,

00:00:15.474 --> 00:00:20.050
we get that P of S is 0.0001.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.365
Similarly, P of H is 0.9999.

00:00:24.364 --> 00:00:27.209
Since the test has 99 percent accuracy,

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.315
both for sick and for healthy patients,

00:00:29.315 --> 00:00:32.990
we see that P of plus,

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.650
given S is 0.99,

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.100
the probability that the sick patient will get correctly diagnosed.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.020
And that P of plus given H is 0.01,

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.710
the probability that the healthy patient will get incorrectly diagnosed as sick.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.509
So plugging that into the new formula,

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:59.359
we get the probability of being diagnosed as positive when you're sick is exactly 0.0098,

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.125
which is less than 1 percent.

00:01:02.125 --> 00:01:04.180
Really? Less than 1 percent?

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.730
When the test has 99 percent accuracy?

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.760
That's strange, but I guess that's the answer to the quiz.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.035
So, less than 1 percent falls in this category of 0 to 20 percent.

00:01:14.034 --> 00:01:16.709
I'm still puzzled though, why less than 1 percent If

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:19.754
the test is correct 99 percent of the time.

00:01:19.754 --> 00:01:23.155
Well, let's explore. Let's go back to the tree of possibilities.

00:01:23.155 --> 00:01:25.905
Let's say we start with 1 million patients,

00:01:25.905 --> 00:01:28.715
and they have two options, healthy and sick.

00:01:28.715 --> 00:01:31.825
Now, since 1 out of every 10,000 patients is sick,

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:34.305
then from this group of 1 million patients,

00:01:34.305 --> 00:01:40.330
100 will be sick and the remaining 999,900 will be healthy.

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:43.250
Now let's remember that for every 100 patients,

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.230
99 get correctly diagnosed and one gets incorrectly diagnosed,

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.950
this happens both for sick and for healthy patients.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.525
So, let's see how many of these patients will get diagnosed positively or negatively.

00:01:55.525 --> 00:01:58.120
Out of the 100 sick ones,

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.520
99 will be correctly diagnosed as

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:05.034
positive and one will be incorrectly diagnosed as negative.

00:02:05.034 --> 00:02:06.769
Now, out of the healthy ones,

00:02:06.769 --> 00:02:12.789
1 percent or 9,999 will be incorrectly diagnosed as positive and

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:20.155
the remaining 99 percent or 989,901 will be correctly diagnosed as negative.

00:02:20.155 --> 00:02:22.360
Now let's really examine these four groups.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.175
The first group is the sick people who we will send for more test or treatment.

00:02:27.175 --> 00:02:31.615
The second is the unlucky sick people that will be sent home with no treatment.

00:02:31.615 --> 00:02:36.790
The third is a slightly confused healthy people who will be sent for more tests.

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:39.389
And the fourth group or the majority is

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:42.754
the people who are healthy and were correctly diagnosed healthy and sent home.

00:02:42.754 --> 00:02:44.439
But now, here's the thing,

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:46.164
we know we tested positively,

00:02:46.164 --> 00:02:48.784
so we must be among one of these two groups,

00:02:48.784 --> 00:02:54.699
the sick people who tested positively or the healthy people who tested positively.

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:56.199
One group is much larger,

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:58.750
it has 9,999 people,

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.379
whereas the other one has only 99 people.

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:07.359
The probability that we're in this group is much larger than that we're in this group.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.640
As a matter of fact, the probability that we are in the small group is

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:17.834
99 divided by the sum, 99 plus 9,999,

00:03:17.835 --> 00:03:22.625
which is, you guessed it, 0.0098,

00:03:22.625 --> 00:03:24.955
which is smaller than 1 percent,

00:03:24.955 --> 00:03:30.925
this is the probability of being sick if you are diagnosed as positive.

00:03:30.925 --> 00:03:34.320
But why is the group of healthy people who tested positively so

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.745
much larger than the group of sick people who tested positively?

00:03:37.745 --> 00:03:39.060
The reason is because,

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.030
even though the test only fails 1 percent of the time,

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.740
that 1 percent is much,

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.825
much larger than the one out of 10,000 rate of sickness among the population.

00:03:48.824 --> 00:03:53.294
In other words, in a group of 10,000 healthy people,

00:03:53.294 --> 00:03:57.219
1 percent or a 100 of them will get misdiagnosed as sick.

00:03:57.219 --> 00:03:58.594
On the other hand,

00:03:58.594 --> 00:04:00.634
in a group of 10,000 people,

00:04:00.634 --> 00:04:02.599
around one will be sick,

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:04.150
this is much less.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.555
So if you know you've tested positively,

00:04:06.555 --> 00:04:12.425
you are still more likely to be among the 100 errors than among the ones sick.

00:04:12.425 --> 00:04:13.910
And how much more likely?

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:16.920
Around 100 times, and that's why our probability of being

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.730
sick while being diagnosed positively is around 1 percent.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.280
This phenomenon is called the False Positive,

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:25.079
and it has been a nightmare for the medical world,

00:04:25.079 --> 00:04:26.930
the legal world and many others.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.084
Search False Positives on Google,

00:04:29.084 --> 00:04:34.229
and you'll see many cases in which people have been misdiagnosed, misjudged etc.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.330
So always be aware of false positives,

00:04:36.329 --> 00:04:38.129
they are very sneaky.
