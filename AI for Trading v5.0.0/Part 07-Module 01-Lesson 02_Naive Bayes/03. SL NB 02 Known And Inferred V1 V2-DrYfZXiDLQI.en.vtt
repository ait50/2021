00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.609
In the last video, we saw an example of Bayes theorem.

00:00:02.609 --> 00:00:06.334
But here's the main idea fit and it's a very powerful theorem.

00:00:06.334 --> 00:00:11.835
What it does is it switches from what we know to what we infer.

00:00:11.835 --> 00:00:14.850
What we know in this case is the probability that Alex

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.434
wears red and the probability that Brenda wears red.

00:00:18.434 --> 00:00:20.369
And what we infer is the opposite,

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.575
is the probability that someone wearing red is

00:00:22.574 --> 00:00:25.724
Alex or that someone wearing red is Brenda.

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:29.700
In other words, initially we know the probability of an event A.

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.408
And to give us more information,

00:00:31.408 --> 00:00:35.265
we introduce a new event R which is related to A.

00:00:35.265 --> 00:00:37.770
We know the probability of R given A.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.290
What Bayes' theorem does is from these two,

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:44.039
it infers the probability of A given R. This

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:49.530
is the new probability of A once we know that the event R has occurred
