00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.514
Now the question is, how do we use this wonderful Bayes theorem to do machine learning.

00:00:04.514 --> 00:00:06.644
And the answer is repeatedly.

00:00:06.644 --> 00:00:08.669
Let's look at this example,

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:11.009
a spam email classifier.

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:14.189
So let's say, we have some data in the form of a bunch of emails.

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:17.894
Some of them are spam and some of them are not spam, which we call ham.

00:00:17.894 --> 00:00:20.820
Spam are, "Win money now!" "Make cash easy!"

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.320
et cetera. And the ham are,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.925
"How are you?" "There you are!"

00:00:23.925 --> 00:00:27.030
et cetera. And now, what we'll do is,

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.429
a new email comes in say,

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.090
"easy money" and we want to check if it's spam or ham.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.830
So, we take it word by word.

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.179
Of course, we can be more effective if we took into account the order of the words,

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:41.085
but for this classifier, we won't.

00:00:41.085 --> 00:00:43.380
It's surprising how good it can be even if it

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.915
doesn't take into account the order of the words.

00:00:45.914 --> 00:00:48.314
So let's study the first word say, "easy."

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:50.820
We can see that the word "easy" appears once among

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.140
the three spam emails and once among the five ham emails.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.899
And the word "money" appears twice among

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.229
the three spam emails and once among the five ham emails.

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:05.280
So, let's start with calculating some preliminary probabilities as an exercise.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.049
Given the data we have,

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.509
what is the probability of an email containing the word

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.530
"easy" given that it is spam? Here are some options.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.230
And let's also calculate it for the other word.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.640
Again given our data, what's the probability of an email being

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.890
spam given that it contains the word "money"?

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:24.920
Here are the options.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.400
Enter your answer below.
