00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.589
Bayes Theorem can get a little more complex.

00:00:02.589 --> 00:00:04.839
Let's take a look at a small example and what we'll

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:07.810
do here is we'll mess a bit with the prior probability.

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:10.759
So again, we have Alex and Brenda in the office,

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:14.849
and we saw someone pass by quickly and we don't know who the person is.

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.570
So let's say we look more carefully at their schedules and we

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.195
realized that Alex actually works from the office most of the time.

00:00:21.195 --> 00:00:23.704
He comes by three days a week.

00:00:23.704 --> 00:00:26.119
And Brenda travels a lot for work, so,

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.630
she actually comes to the office only one day a week.

00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:32.314
So initially, without knowing anything about the red sweater,

00:00:32.314 --> 00:00:37.609
all we know is that it's three times more likely to see Alex than to see Brenda.

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:45.394
Therefore our prior probabilities are 0.75 for Alex and 0.25 for Brenda.

00:00:45.395 --> 00:00:48.840
And let's say that we have this happening throughout all the weeks,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.680
but now we use our extra knowledge which is that the person we saw had a red sweater.

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:55.655
The rule is still as before,

00:00:55.655 --> 00:01:01.329
as Alex wears red twice a week and Brenda wears red three times a week.

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.739
So, naively we would think that the real probabilities are not exactly

00:01:06.739 --> 00:01:12.009
0.75 or 0.25 because Brenda wears a red sweater more than Alex,

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.395
so they should be a little closer to each other.

00:01:14.394 --> 00:01:17.924
Let's calculate them. So, we'll do the following,

00:01:17.924 --> 00:01:21.105
let's think of the columns as weeks instead.

00:01:21.105 --> 00:01:24.350
So, now for each five-day work week,

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:27.959
Alex wears red twice and Brenda three times.

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:30.489
So, we colored the days they wore red.

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:33.199
Now, since we know the person wore red,

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.375
we forget about the times that they didn't.

00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:38.489
So we have nine times someone wore red.

00:01:38.489 --> 00:01:41.939
Six of them are Alex and three of them are Brenda.

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.504
Therefore, among nine times we saw someone wearing red,

00:01:46.504 --> 00:01:50.569
two-thirds of the times it with Alex and one third of the time it was Brenda.

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:55.199
Thus, our posterior probabilities are two-thirds

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.225
or 0.67 for Alex and one third or 0.33 for Brenda.

00:02:01.224 --> 00:02:03.194
So it looks like we did a little bit of magic.

00:02:03.194 --> 00:02:05.454
Let's do this again in a more mathematical way.

00:02:05.454 --> 00:02:10.079
We saw a person and initially all we know is that it's Alex with

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.390
a 75% probability and Brenda with

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:15.699
a 25% probability since

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:19.185
Alex comes to the office three times a week and Brenda once a week.

00:02:19.185 --> 00:02:23.439
But now new information comes to light which is that the person is wearing

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:29.229
a red sweater and the data says that Alex wears red two times a week.

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:31.069
So now we look at Alex.

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.689
What is the probability that he's wearing red?

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:36.729
Since a work week has five days and the probability of him

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:40.974
wearing red is two-fifths or 0.4.

00:02:40.974 --> 00:02:45.780
And the probability of him not wearing red is the complement, so 0.6.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.590
Same thing with Brenda, since she wears red three a week,

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.629
then the probability of her wearing red today is

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:58.215
0.6 and the probability of her not wearing red is 0.4.

00:02:58.215 --> 00:03:00.729
Now, by the formula of conditional probability,

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:02.679
the probability that these two will happen is

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.085
the product of the two probabilities P of Alex,

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:08.034
times P of red given Alex.

00:03:08.034 --> 00:03:11.819
Therefore, the probability of the person we saw is Alex and that they're

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.814
wearing red is precisely 0.75 times 0.4.

00:03:16.814 --> 00:03:19.465
We multiply them and put the result here.

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:22.050
We calculate the other probabilities in the same way,

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.700
that probability of the person we saw is Alex and that he's not

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:28.219
wearing red is 0.75 times 0.6.

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:31.539
The probability of the person we saw is Brenda and that she's wearing red,

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:33.539
is again the product of these probabilities,

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:35.799
which is 0.25 times 0.6.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.700
And finally, the probability of the person we saw is Brenda and

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:42.159
she's not wearing red is 0.25 times 0.4.

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:45.310
And now here's where the Bayesian magic happens, are you ready?

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.504
We have four possible scenarios

00:03:47.504 --> 00:03:50.125
and you can check that these four probabilities add to one.

00:03:50.125 --> 00:03:52.055
But we know one thing,

00:03:52.055 --> 00:03:54.990
that the person we saw was wearing red.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.844
Therefore, out of these four scenarios,

00:03:57.844 --> 00:03:59.539
only two are plausible,

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:02.364
the two when the person is wearing red.

00:04:02.365 --> 00:04:04.409
So, we forget about the other two.

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:08.495
Now, since our new universe consists of only these two scenarios,

00:04:08.495 --> 00:04:10.865
then the probability should be higher,

00:04:10.865 --> 00:04:15.155
but their ratio should still be the same with respect to each other.

00:04:15.155 --> 00:04:19.365
This means, we need to normalize them or equivalently,

00:04:19.365 --> 00:04:22.615
divide them by something so that they now add to one.

00:04:22.615 --> 00:04:24.300
The thing we should divide them by,

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.790
is the sum of the two.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:31.085
So, our new probability of the person being Alex is the top one, namely,

00:04:31.084 --> 00:04:35.544
0.75 times 0.4 divided by the sum of the two,

00:04:35.545 --> 00:04:38.025
namely, 0.75 times four,

00:04:38.024 --> 00:04:40.839
plus 0.25 zero times 0.6.

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:45.169
This is precisely two-thirds or 0.67,

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.145
and now we can see that the complement is the probability that the person is Brenda,

00:04:49.144 --> 00:04:52.379
which is one third or 0.33.

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:55.629
If we take Brenda's probability and divide it by the sum of

00:04:55.629 --> 00:05:00.154
both probabilities we can see that we get one third as desired.

00:05:00.154 --> 00:05:04.399
And that's it, that is Bayes Theorem at its full potential.
