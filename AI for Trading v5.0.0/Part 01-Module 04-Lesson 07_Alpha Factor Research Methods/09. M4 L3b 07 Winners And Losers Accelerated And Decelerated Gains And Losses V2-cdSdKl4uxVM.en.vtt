00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.129
The paper titled, The Formation Process of Winners and Losers in Momentum Investing,

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:09.300
discusses how the trajectory of a stock is

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.535
an indicator for whether its momentum is accelerated or decelerated.

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:17.949
When a stock is recently showing higher returns,

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:21.660
this paper refers to these as accelerated gains.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.975
When a stock is recently showing minimal positive returns,

00:00:25.975 --> 00:00:30.185
the paper refers to these as decelerated gains.

00:00:30.184 --> 00:00:35.344
If you look at a stock price trajectory of an accelerated gain,

00:00:35.344 --> 00:00:38.174
the shape will be convex.

00:00:38.174 --> 00:00:41.919
In case you can't remember what a convex curve looks like,

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.635
the plot of y equals x squared is an example of a convex function.

00:00:47.634 --> 00:00:52.914
Essentially, the trajectory is showing an accelerated increase.

00:00:52.914 --> 00:00:54.490
On the other hand,

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:00.775
a stock price trajectory of a decelerated gain will have a concave shape.

00:01:00.774 --> 00:01:03.679
As a reminder of what concave means,

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:09.224
a plot of y equals the square root of x is an example of a concave function.

00:01:09.224 --> 00:01:13.834
The trajectory is showing a decelerated increase.

00:01:13.834 --> 00:01:20.375
We can also describe accelerated losses and decelerated losses as concave or convex.

00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:23.765
An accelerated loss has a concave shape.

00:01:23.765 --> 00:01:29.155
You can imagine the plot of y equals negative x squared as a concave function.

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:33.215
A decelerated loss has a convex shape.

00:01:33.215 --> 00:01:41.450
You can imagine the plot of y equals negative square root of x as a convex shape.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.435
So far, we've described four general shapes.

00:01:45.435 --> 00:01:48.530
What we want to point out is which type of

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.385
trajectory may be preferred for going long or going short.

00:01:52.385 --> 00:01:55.579
We'd say that an accelerated gain may have

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.569
higher future returns compared to a decelerated gain,

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:02.464
if the starting and end points are the same.

00:02:02.465 --> 00:02:06.439
So, we would prefer to go long the accelerated gain,

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.025
a bit more than the decelerated gain.

00:02:09.025 --> 00:02:13.010
We would also say that an accelerated loss is

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:17.329
predictive of more negative returns compared to a decelerated loss.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.765
So, all else being equal,

00:02:18.764 --> 00:02:24.079
we would prefer to short the accelerated loss more than the decelerated loss.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.210
An important point that might not be obvious to see in the paper is that we can

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.430
view the convexity or concavity of a curve in a relative terms.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.670
In other words, compared to a convex curve,

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:43.159
a straight line is relatively more concave.

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:46.405
Likewise, compared to a concave curve,

00:02:46.405 --> 00:02:50.194
a straight line is relatively more convex.

00:02:50.194 --> 00:02:54.939
You may recall with the example of the tortoise stock and the rabbit stock.

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:58.639
The tortoise stock trajectory look like a straight line,

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:01.700
whereas the rabbits stock was concave.

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:05.280
So, relative to the rabbit stocks trajectory,

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.574
the tortoise stocks trajectory was more convex and

00:03:09.574 --> 00:03:15.139
also more predictive of higher future returns under this hypothesis.
