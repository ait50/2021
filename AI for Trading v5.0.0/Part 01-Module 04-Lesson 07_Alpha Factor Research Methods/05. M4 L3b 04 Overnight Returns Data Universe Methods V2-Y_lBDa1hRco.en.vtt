00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080
The paper identifies its dataset as the Center for Research and Security Prices,

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.245
which is often abbreviated as CRSP and can be referred to as CRISP.

00:00:12.244 --> 00:00:15.334
This is a fairly well-known pricing dataset.

00:00:15.335 --> 00:00:17.310
And if you check out their website,

00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:21.208
you can see that the data is available via subscription.

00:00:21.208 --> 00:00:23.649
We don't use that data precisely,

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:26.994
but we are using a pricing dataset which is very similar.

00:00:26.995 --> 00:00:30.545
It's also helpful to check what stock universe

00:00:30.545 --> 00:00:34.774
the authors think are most relevant to the factors they are analyzing.

00:00:34.774 --> 00:00:40.399
Even though a factor would ideally be applicable and useful for a broad range of stocks,

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.504
it's also possible that certain factors only generate

00:00:43.505 --> 00:00:47.260
meaningful signals for a certain subgroup of stocks.

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:50.719
In the abstract, the authors mentioned that mean

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.390
reversion or momentum factors that they're

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.969
evaluating are more pronounced for hard to value firms.

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:03.030
If we look through the paper for mention of harder to value firms,

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.825
we see how they define them in section four titled,

00:01:06.825 --> 00:01:09.560
Short-term Overnight Return Persistence,

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.329
Hard to Value Firms and Institutional Share Holdings.

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:15.679
According to other papers they cite,

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.350
harder to value firms are more volatile,

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:20.099
have a smaller market cap,

00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:23.750
are newer companies, currently less profitable,

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.614
and considered high growth companies as exhibited by higher price to earnings ratios.

00:01:29.614 --> 00:01:35.810
Remember that I said when you see and, think conditional factor.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.250
If you wanted to implement these specific ideas,

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.969
you would do so via the mechanics of a conditional factor.

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:46.390
We don't do that in this exercise however.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.859
The authors provide some context for why harder to value firms may be more likely to

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:58.189
exhibit overbuying at market open or weekly momentum of closed open returns.

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.629
The hypothesis is that individual investors may rely more

00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:07.614
on sentiment when the fundamentals of the company are more difficult to measure.

00:02:07.614 --> 00:02:12.805
This sentiment is expressed in the recent closed open returns of the stock.

00:02:12.805 --> 00:02:16.764
We can also scan the paper for useful methodology,

00:02:16.764 --> 00:02:21.004
which we can apply more broadly to any factors that we're evaluating.

00:02:21.003 --> 00:02:23.599
For instance, in section two,

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.269
the authors define the weekly overnight return on the stock.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.520
If you haven't read this section yet,

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.130
you may imagine taking a window of five days daily returns,

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.444
adding them up to get the weekly cumulative close to open return.

00:02:39.444 --> 00:02:42.370
The authors do something slightly different.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.509
They take the average of the daily returns over five trading days,

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:49.409
then they multiply by five.

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:53.594
Can you think of how this is different or why they may do this?

00:02:53.594 --> 00:02:56.129
Notice that if we had missing data,

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:00.590
then simply adding up the daily closed open returns over a five-day window,

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.520
may not make each week comparable.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.770
If a certain week is missing data for one day,

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.405
then we would only have four days worth of returns to add up.

00:03:10.405 --> 00:03:13.569
By taking the daily average and then multiplying by five,

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.759
we can better deal with missing data and help make

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:21.319
each week's cumulative return more comparable to other weeks.
