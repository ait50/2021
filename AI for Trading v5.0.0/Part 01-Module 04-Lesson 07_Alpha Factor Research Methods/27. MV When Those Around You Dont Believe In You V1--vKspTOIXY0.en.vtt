00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.595
Sometimes, the people around us,

00:00:02.595 --> 00:00:05.235
whether they're our friends, colleagues or family,

00:00:05.235 --> 00:00:09.449
try to give us career advice based on their own personal experience,

00:00:09.448 --> 00:00:11.699
and sometimes they give great advice.

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:14.189
Other times, the advice they give,

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:17.579
the well-intention, may not feel very supportive.

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:20.099
It's possible that at some point in your life,

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.590
someone has told you that you weren't good enough at math,

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:25.454
but they didn't have the right credentials from the rate university,

00:00:25.454 --> 00:00:28.230
or you might have heard that it's too late to do what you want to do,

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.490
or that you can't compete with

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:32.250
all the other people out there who are aiming for the same job.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.244
I know I've heard things like this before.

00:00:34.244 --> 00:00:37.309
Lucky for us, the nature of work and education is changing,

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.010
and we know from research that with well applied effort,

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:41.734
any of us can learn anything.

00:00:41.734 --> 00:00:45.618
So if you ever find yourself hearing comments like that,

00:00:45.618 --> 00:00:47.509
we'd like to remind you that you are learning from

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:51.320
top industry experts in building industry relevant projects.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.869
You have every reason to trust in your knowledge,

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:56.269
skills, and ability to grow.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.860
As the great philosopher,

00:00:57.859 --> 00:00:59.390
Taylor Swift once said,

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.270
"You can just shake it off." Shake it off.
