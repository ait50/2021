00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
In section three titled Weekly Overnight Returns,

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.165
the authors check if the weekly close-to-open returns persist one,

00:00:08.164 --> 00:00:11.224
two, three, or four weeks into the future.

00:00:11.224 --> 00:00:15.239
The authors make use of quantiles to analyze the data.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.929
They sort the weekly overnight returns and then divide

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:22.739
these into deciles or 10 quantiles.

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:24.754
If we jump to table two,

00:00:24.754 --> 00:00:26.849
titled Short-Run Persistence of

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.515
Weekly Overnight Returns and Subsequent Weeks' Total Return,

00:00:30.515 --> 00:00:35.344
we can see that decile one contains the lowest overnight returns,

00:00:35.344 --> 00:00:39.159
while decile 10 contains the highest overnight returns.

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:40.889
In the other columns,

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.655
we can see that decile one has low overnight returns one,

00:00:45.655 --> 00:00:47.935
two, three, and four weeks later.

00:00:47.935 --> 00:00:54.710
Similarly, decile 10 has higher positive returns in its subsequent weeks.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.049
This is an indication that

00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:02.719
weekly overnight returns may persist for up to four weeks into the future.

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:08.000
We now have some ideas for potential factors and how to implement them.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.385
First, we'll want to calculate overnight returns,

00:01:11.385 --> 00:01:13.310
which are the returns from the closed price of

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.040
the previous evening to the open price of the following morning.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.890
Next, we'll aggregate overnight returns by week to get weekly overnight returns.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.469
Based on the analysis of this paper,

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:29.659
the hypothesis we'll use for this factor is that

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:36.274
higher weekly returns for a stock indicate higher subsequent returns in the near future.

00:01:36.275 --> 00:01:39.980
In other words, our strategy will be to overweight stocks that have

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:46.320
high weekly overnight returns and to underweight stocks that have low weekly returns.
