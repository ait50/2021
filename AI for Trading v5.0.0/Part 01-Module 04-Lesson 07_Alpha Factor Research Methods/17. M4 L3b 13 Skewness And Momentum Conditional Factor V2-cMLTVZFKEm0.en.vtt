00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
Let's see how we can create a conditional factor based on momentum and skew.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.085
We first might want to convert both momentum and skew to ranks,

00:00:09.085 --> 00:00:13.695
since ranks are generally more stable and more robust to outliers.

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:18.510
Notice though, that skew is a reversal or mean-reversion signal.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.155
So, we want to rank the skew in reverse order.

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:27.285
Think about this in the context of our definition of enhanced momentum,

00:00:27.285 --> 00:00:31.670
and work out for yourself a few examples of why this works.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.280
That is, if our stock universe had 100 stocks,

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.730
then the stock with the smallest skew would have the rank of 100,

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:47.009
whereas the stock with the largest skew would have a rank of one.

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:50.064
The momentum factor would be ranked as usual,

00:00:50.064 --> 00:00:55.159
where the most negative return is given a rank of one,

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:59.049
and the most positive return has a rank of 100.

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:04.245
If we multiply the rank of momentum times the reverse rank of skew,

00:01:04.245 --> 00:01:06.600
we will have the joint factor.

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:12.254
The smallest alpha values would translate into the largest short positions,

00:01:12.254 --> 00:01:18.199
and the largest alpha values would translate into the largest long positions.
