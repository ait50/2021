00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
I hinted previously, that we could use skewness as a signal that

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.759
stocks may be over bought in the short-term and may revert back soon afterwards.

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:11.875
To help you understand skewness,

00:00:11.875 --> 00:00:15.009
I'll first introduce a visual notion of skew.

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:18.410
Then the common academic definition of skew,

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.710
followed by the proxy for skewness that we will use when creating this Alpha factor.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.160
Skewness refers to the asymmetry in a distribution.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.024
When a distribution is negatively skewed,

00:00:31.024 --> 00:00:33.619
it has a longer tail on the left.

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:36.314
When the distribution is positively skewed,

00:00:36.314 --> 00:00:38.460
it has a longer tail on the right.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.545
Skewness also means that the mean of a distribution is different than its medium.

00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:48.995
Negative skew, indicates that the mean is to the left of the median.

00:00:48.994 --> 00:00:53.509
You can imagine the small portion of extreme values on the left,

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:55.280
pulling the mean to the left.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.370
While the median stays closer to the majority of observations.

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:04.924
Similarly, a positive skew indicates that the mean is to the right of the median.

00:01:04.924 --> 00:01:08.840
You can imagine that the extreme values to the right,

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.299
pull the mean to the right as well while the median

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.420
stays closer to the majority of observations.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.954
If you learned about skewness in school,

00:01:16.954 --> 00:01:19.459
you may recall the concept of the first,

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:22.129
second, third, and fourth moments of a distribution.

00:01:22.129 --> 00:01:26.224
The first moment is commonly known as the mean or average.

00:01:26.224 --> 00:01:29.194
The second moment is known as the variance.

00:01:29.194 --> 00:01:33.354
The third moment is skewness which we are discussing here.

00:01:33.355 --> 00:01:39.225
The fourth moment is kurtosis which measures the tails of the distribution.

00:01:39.224 --> 00:01:41.944
Stock returns generally exhibit

00:01:41.944 --> 00:01:46.924
excess kurtosis or fat tails compared to the normal distribution.

00:01:46.924 --> 00:01:50.125
For now though, we'll focus on skewness.

00:01:50.125 --> 00:01:54.265
So, those were the visual and traditional interpretations of skewness.

00:01:54.265 --> 00:01:59.025
Now, let's circle back to the definition of skewness used in this paper,

00:01:59.025 --> 00:02:01.710
and what we will implement in the Alpha factor.

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:04.640
A useful proxy for skewness is

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.405
the maximum daily return of a stock over the past 20 trading days.

00:02:09.405 --> 00:02:11.944
This definition is useful in part,

00:02:11.944 --> 00:02:16.995
because of how it captures how individual investors may perceive skewness.

00:02:16.995 --> 00:02:19.789
It's possible to imagine that an investor may

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:23.764
look at a recent stock high of a company as an indicator,

00:02:23.764 --> 00:02:27.869
upon which they will base their decision to buy or sell the stock.
