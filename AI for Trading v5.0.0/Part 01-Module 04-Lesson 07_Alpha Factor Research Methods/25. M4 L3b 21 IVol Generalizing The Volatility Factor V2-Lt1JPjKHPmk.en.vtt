00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.049
Now that we've walked through risk factor models and Alpha factors,

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:09.660
I hope you'll start to see how you can try out different variations

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.900
that deviate from the specific methods you see in academic papers.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.679
For instance, instead of using the Fama French model to extract idiosyncratic volatility,

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:25.199
you may try other risk factor models that you learned about in this module,

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.875
such as a risk factor model based on principle component analysis.

00:00:29.875 --> 00:00:33.645
Moreover, you can try pairing iVol with

00:00:33.645 --> 00:00:38.540
other fundamental factors or really any other Alpha factors as well.

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:43.049
If you can develop a good habit of reading academic research,

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:47.914
proposing and implementing then evaluating potential Alpha vectors,

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:54.399
these experiences will serve you well in preparing for roles in quantitative finance.
