00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.089
You may recall that overcharge is

00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:07.695
a process that seeks profits due to mis-pricing of assets.

00:00:07.695 --> 00:00:10.740
In other words, overcharge looks for inefficiencies in

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.460
the market in order to profit from these inefficiencies.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.200
Moreover, the act of overcharge actually reduces the mis-pricing of assets,

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.829
and the individual acts of overcharge by market participants

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:28.839
as a whole add up to support a more efficient market.

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:31.879
When we think of profit seeking activities

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:35.284
in their role in maintaining efficient pricing in markets.

00:00:35.284 --> 00:00:39.094
It can also include buying stocks that are considered

00:00:39.094 --> 00:00:43.519
under-priced or shorting stocks that are considered over-priced.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.720
In other words, overcharge here is that

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.155
the instantaneous buying and selling of perfect substitute assets.

00:00:52.155 --> 00:00:56.090
Here, we simply mean buying assets with an

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.280
expected return greater than that warranted by the risk taken,

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.519
and similarly shorting assets with

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.965
an expected negative return that is less than that warranted by the risk taken.

00:01:09.965 --> 00:01:12.740
Even though only taking a long or only

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:16.000
taking a short position is not technically overcharge,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.444
when market participants seek to profit from mis-priced assets,

00:01:20.444 --> 00:01:25.529
their actions help to reduce that mis-pricing and make markets more efficient.
