00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.625
Let's read the abstract of the paper,

00:00:02.625 --> 00:00:07.224
Overnight Returns and Firm Specific Investor Sentiment.

00:00:07.224 --> 00:00:12.129
We can see that the authors tried to analyze something called overnight returns.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.170
If we skip ahead to Section 2 titled sample,

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.275
variable definitions, and descriptive statistics,

00:00:19.274 --> 00:00:23.129
we can see that overnight returns are defined as the percent change from

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:27.794
the close price of the previous day to the opening price of the next day.

00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:32.469
The overnight returns are also called closed open returns.

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:35.085
They also mentioned investor sentiment.

00:00:35.085 --> 00:00:37.109
If we jump to the introduction,

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:42.219
we see that overnight returns may be used as a proxy for firm-level investor sentiment.

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:44.060
In the context of the paper,

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.150
firm level sentiment appears to refer to whether

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.265
investors have a positive or negative view of a stock's future price.

00:00:51.265 --> 00:00:57.685
It also helps to check the paper for signs of either a momentum or mean-reversion factor.

00:00:57.685 --> 00:01:02.300
It mentions short-term overnight return persistence.

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:04.769
When we read the word persistence,

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.685
we can interpret this as referring to some kind of momentum.

00:01:08.685 --> 00:01:13.700
The paper also says that stocks with high overnight returns underperform.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.290
We can interpret this as a kind of mean reversion.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.290
After reading the abstract,

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.065
it's okay to quickly scan the paper for a preview of major sections.

00:01:24.064 --> 00:01:27.185
It's common for papers to have an introduction,

00:01:27.185 --> 00:01:31.040
methodology, results, and conclusion section.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.070
It's also okay to read the paper out of order.

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:38.329
For example, you can start with the introduction,

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:40.510
jump to the conclusion,

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.800
then work your way through the methodology and results.
