00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.665
Remember from our prior discussions,

00:00:02.665 --> 00:00:04.974
especially the one about risk models,

00:00:04.974 --> 00:00:10.589
the returns can be broken up into a systematic and idiosyncratic component.

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:13.650
Likewise, the volatility of returns can be broken

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.670
up into systematic and idiosyncratic components.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:25.150
Idiosyncratic risk maybe a more helpful indicator of arbitrage risk. Why is this?

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:30.599
Because market participants who pursue strategies to capture relative mispricings

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.905
will seek to eliminate common factor risks leaving them bearing idiosyncratic risks only.

00:00:36.905 --> 00:00:41.399
As such, when we think about the risks to arbitrage,

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.229
we likely should consider only the idiosyncratic risks.

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:48.890
Recall that the systematic component of a stock's risk can

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.585
be attributed to movements in major risk factors.

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:55.539
For example, using the CAPM model,

00:00:55.539 --> 00:01:01.060
a part of a stock's movement can be attributed to the movement of the market as a whole.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.000
The rest of the stock's return that cannot be attributed to

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.090
major risk factors is the idiosyncratic component of its return.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.200
One way to isolate the idiosyncratic return,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.210
is by fitting a multiple regression using the risk factors.

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:18.984
In this research paper,

00:01:18.984 --> 00:01:22.105
the authors use the Fama-French model.

00:01:22.105 --> 00:01:26.990
The model gives a prediction of the return due to the model factors.

00:01:26.989 --> 00:01:31.669
Since the model factors do not fully explain the stock's returns,

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.870
there will be a difference between the actual and modeled returns.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.289
This difference is called the residual.

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.314
If we take the standard deviation of the residual return,

00:01:43.314 --> 00:01:48.659
we get the idiosyncratic volatility which is also called the idiosyncratic risk.

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.689
In short, the idiosyncratic volatility or

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:56.914
iVol is the volatility that is specific to the stock,

00:01:56.915 --> 00:02:00.150
and not explained by the risk factors.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.775
This is useful for us because when we want to measure a stock's arbitrage risk,

00:02:05.775 --> 00:02:10.930
what we're interested in is the specific or idiosyncratic risk of that stock,

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:16.400
and not the systematic risk that exists broadly among all stocks.
