00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.349
The last alpha factor that we'll construct is based on the paper

00:00:04.349 --> 00:00:09.629
titled "Arbitrage asymmetry and the idiosyncratic volatility puzzle."

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.115
This paper uses a lot of the concepts that we've learned,

00:00:13.115 --> 00:00:16.679
including a unique example of using some of

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:21.390
the output of a risk model as part of alpha factor construction.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.830
Personally, I enjoy this example because we combined so much of what we have

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:30.568
learned in addition to some more ideas from behavioral finance.

00:00:30.568 --> 00:00:32.269
Based on this paper,

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.295
we'll construct a conditional factor,

00:00:34.295 --> 00:00:38.385
a fundamental factor enhanced by a volatility factor.

00:00:38.384 --> 00:00:41.689
Let's start with some background information that will help

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:45.344
you interpret the meaning of the two factors that we'll combine.

00:00:45.344 --> 00:00:50.104
We'll first remind ourselves of how arbitrage supports efficient markets.

00:00:50.104 --> 00:00:56.919
Next, we'll look at volatility and how volatility may limit arbitrage activities.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.250
Then we'll look at the idiosyncratic portion of volatility and why

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.170
this might be more useful as a factor than the total volatility.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.165
Then we'll refresh the meaning of a value factor,

00:01:10.165 --> 00:01:13.050
which is a type of fundamental factor.

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:20.259
Lastly, we'll combine the value factor and idiosyncratic volatility into a joined factor.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.500
We'll discuss generalizing what we've learned so that you can use

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.480
your creativity and create related factors of your own.
