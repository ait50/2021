00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.964
From reading the introduction,

00:00:01.964 --> 00:00:03.929
we see that the authors refer to

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.749
investor sentiment as the positive or negative views of investors,

00:00:07.748 --> 00:00:12.804
especially individuals who tend to cluster their orders around a market open.

00:00:12.804 --> 00:00:16.929
The authors also define overnight returns as the close to

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:21.105
open returns and describe the following hypothesis.

00:00:21.105 --> 00:00:24.269
Individual investors may notice attention

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.384
getting events and may then choose to trade on those events.

00:00:28.385 --> 00:00:30.440
Since many of them have day jobs,

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.765
they may place trades aftermarket clothes that would be executed the following morning.

00:00:35.765 --> 00:00:39.049
The hypothesis continues to assume that

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:45.069
these overnight trades may be subject to mean-reversion by the middle of that second day.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:51.049
Based on this, you may start thinking about how this can be useful as an alpha factor.

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:54.299
Let's say, a stock's overnight returns are high.

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:57.229
So, that morning, you see an increase in

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:00.515
a stock's open price relative to the previous day's close.

00:01:00.515 --> 00:01:02.369
According to this hypothesis,

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:08.109
the stock is overbought and we may expect a correction in a form of a drop in the price.

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:11.799
So, if you calculate the overnight return of the stock,

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:16.844
you can short the stock that same morning when the overnight return is high.

00:01:16.844 --> 00:01:21.084
However, that's not the effect that we will look to capture here.

00:01:21.084 --> 00:01:26.229
There are ideas later in the paper that we will use to construct an alpha factor.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.174
Also, in the introduction,

00:01:28.174 --> 00:01:33.780
the authors state that they test for short-run persistence in overnight returns.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.394
This indicates some momentum in the overnight returns over a short term window.

00:01:40.394 --> 00:01:46.134
If we continue reading in section two titled sample, variable definitions,

00:01:46.135 --> 00:01:49.219
descriptive statistics, we can see that they're

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:53.045
interested in a window of one week or five trading days.

00:01:53.045 --> 00:01:57.409
They calculate the average daily close to open return over

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.879
a week as a measure of the persistence or momentum in sentiments.

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:05.774
Again, based on this information,

00:02:05.775 --> 00:02:07.280
you can think about how

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.650
this weekly average momentum factor might be used in a theoretical portfolio.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.074
If according to the hypothesis,

00:02:15.074 --> 00:02:20.000
the weekly average close to open return for a stock is high and positive,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.909
we might want to buy more shares of that stock with

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:27.044
the assumption that the positive returns will continue in the short run.

00:02:27.044 --> 00:02:31.704
Finally, the abstract also identifies a third possible factor.

00:02:31.705 --> 00:02:34.680
With the hypothesis that in the longer term,

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.385
stocks with high overnight returns under perform.

00:02:38.384 --> 00:02:41.704
In other words, in a longer time window,

00:02:41.705 --> 00:02:44.430
stocks exhibit mean reversion.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.129
If we go to section five titled longer-term returns,

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.319
the hypothesis based on

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.414
other papers is that stocks that are more attractive to speculators

00:02:55.414 --> 00:02:57.439
and therefore see more near term

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:02.250
positive returns may end up under performing over the next 12 months.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.800
However, this also is not the effect we will look to capture here.
