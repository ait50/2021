00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
Now that we have a sense for how accelerated or

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.935
decelerated gains and losses look like visually,

00:00:05.934 --> 00:00:11.019
how do we represent their relative convexity or concavity in numbers?

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:13.599
One way to approximate a curve,

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.199
is with a formula that looks like y equals x squared.

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:22.429
Or more accurately, y equals ax plus bx squared.

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:28.559
The authors use t as the independent variable name representing time,

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:33.129
such as the number of days from the start of the stocks trajectory.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.580
They also use beta as the coefficient for t,

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.344
and gamma as the coefficient for t squared.

00:00:40.344 --> 00:00:43.324
To make the discussion easier to follow,

00:00:43.325 --> 00:00:46.955
let's just give descriptive names to the coefficients.

00:00:46.954 --> 00:00:50.498
The coefficient for t will be called gain,

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:54.770
and the coefficient for t squared will be called accelerate.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.845
You'll see why we chose these names in a minute.

00:00:57.844 --> 00:01:02.920
Let's see what a positive or negative direction coefficient might look like.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.795
If we just ignore the t squared term,

00:01:05.795 --> 00:01:08.219
a positive gain coefficient,

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:14.269
will make a line that slopes upward which could represent a stock price that is gaining.

00:01:14.269 --> 00:01:17.884
Conversely, a negative gain coefficient,

00:01:17.885 --> 00:01:23.995
makes a line that slopes downward which could represent a stock price that is losing.

00:01:23.995 --> 00:01:26.090
Next, we can look at

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.290
the accelerate coefficient and how it affects the shape of the curve.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.015
If the gain coefficient is positive,

00:01:33.015 --> 00:01:36.564
and the accelerate coefficient is also positive,

00:01:36.564 --> 00:01:41.019
both the t term and the t squared term are pointing up and to the right,

00:01:41.019 --> 00:01:45.289
so the curve is convex and looks like an accelerated gain.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.460
If the gain coefficient is still positive but the accelerate coefficient is negative,

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:55.799
the t term is being counteracted by the t squared term,

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.500
so the curve looks like a decelerated gain.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.280
Let's look at two more cases when the gain coefficient is negative.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.760
If the accelerate coefficient is also negative,

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.444
then both terms are pushing the trajectory downward,

00:02:11.444 --> 00:02:15.250
so the curve looks like an accelerated loss.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:22.210
Lastly, if the gain coefficient is negative but the accelerate coefficient is positive,

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:28.040
the two terms counteract each other and the curve looks like a decelerated loss.

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:30.229
Okay, now for the fun part.

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:32.810
Based on whether the gain coefficient and

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.745
the accelerated coefficient are positive or negative,

00:02:35.745 --> 00:02:41.270
can you decide which scenarios you would rather go long, or short?
