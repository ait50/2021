00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.995
Not all arbitrage opportunities are created equal.

00:00:03.995 --> 00:00:08.695
If you found two similar stocks with similar mispricing,

00:00:08.695 --> 00:00:10.574
all else being equal,

00:00:10.574 --> 00:00:13.959
you'd prefer to act on the stock that is less risky.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.565
For example, let's imagine we have identified

00:00:17.565 --> 00:00:21.425
through a model in which we have high confidence two stocks,

00:00:21.425 --> 00:00:25.800
A and B, which are each undervalued by 10 percent.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.550
However, stock B typically fluctuates two times as much as stock A.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.054
If we're limited to our capital deployment,

00:00:35.054 --> 00:00:37.515
which is how much cash we can invest,

00:00:37.515 --> 00:00:40.380
and we can only choose one stock,

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.420
we would likely choose to buy stock A since

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.550
our expected Sharpe ratio will be much higher.

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:51.569
Remember, in neither case are we guaranteed to make money,

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.340
we just have a model in which we have high confidence.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.160
Now take this example and think of the universal effect.

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:02.164
All savvy arbitragers like us,

00:01:02.164 --> 00:01:04.435
would prefer stock A,

00:01:04.435 --> 00:01:08.475
and the opportunity in stock A might get arbitraged

00:01:08.474 --> 00:01:13.584
away before we even have a chance to buy the stock.

00:01:13.584 --> 00:01:16.890
If that's true, then in fact,

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.180
we may be better off trying to capture the discount in

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:26.800
stock B as there will be less competition to capture the opportunity presented there.

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.935
That's the gist of this paper.

00:01:29.935 --> 00:01:33.590
The risk that acting on an arbitraged opportunity

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.475
may actually yield a loss is called arbitrage risk.

00:01:37.474 --> 00:01:40.829
As you may have guessed from the example,

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.864
one source of arbitrage risk is the volatility of the stock,

00:01:44.864 --> 00:01:47.599
defined as the standard deviation of returns.
