00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
One of the most exciting developments in investing in the last couple of

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.155
years is the convergence of the quants and fundamental processes.

00:00:09.154 --> 00:00:13.234
This is called quantamental investing in the popular press,

00:00:13.234 --> 00:00:16.425
as a combination of the words quant and fundamental.

00:00:16.425 --> 00:00:19.410
But don't let that goofy name fool you.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.835
It's more than just a fad or a marketing term.

00:00:22.835 --> 00:00:28.635
This quantamental convergence of fundamental and quant is significant and growing.

00:00:28.635 --> 00:00:32.590
The idea is that the advent of AI methods,

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.359
and the exponential growth of data generated by the real economy are now allowing quants

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:40.729
to use inputs that have historically been

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:44.714
exclusively in the domain of fundamental investors.

00:00:44.715 --> 00:00:49.660
On the other hand, the growing acceptance of the value of data science,

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:52.164
and the observable successive quants,

00:00:52.164 --> 00:00:55.549
has led fundamental investors to embrace

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:59.864
data-driven research methods and some aspects of the quant workflow,

00:00:59.865 --> 00:01:02.150
like the use of risk models.

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.765
This is an exciting time.

00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:08.329
Let me give you a concrete example of this convergence.

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:12.019
A part of the investment process that has been historically

00:01:12.019 --> 00:01:16.344
solely in the domain of fundamental researchers is text analysis,

00:01:16.344 --> 00:01:17.980
listening to conference calls,

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.210
reading corporate filings, news, et cetera.

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:24.589
There are now effective computational methods to get

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.395
intelligence from this text information in a systematic way.

00:01:28.394 --> 00:01:30.314
Note that in term two,

00:01:30.314 --> 00:01:33.844
we will cover traditional natural language processing techniques,

00:01:33.844 --> 00:01:36.409
as well as deep learning for NLP.

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.549
I'm sure you are very excited about that.

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.094
But please be patient,

00:01:41.094 --> 00:01:43.560
let's finish term one first.
