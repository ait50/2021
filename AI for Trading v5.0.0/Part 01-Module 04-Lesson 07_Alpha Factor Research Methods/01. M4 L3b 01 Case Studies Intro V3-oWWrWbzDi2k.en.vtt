00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390
Hi, welcome to the lesson where we'll take

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:09.169
a deeper look at four academic papers and see how we can code up Alpha factors from them.

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:12.074
In building the material for this lesson,

00:00:12.074 --> 00:00:17.259
I browsed dozens of academic papers and chose some of these to implement.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.710
Note, that I didn't choose these papers

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.315
particularly because they produced great Alphas, rather,

00:00:23.315 --> 00:00:26.510
I chose them to give a diversity of style and show

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.270
important techniques and building blocks for making Alphas.

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.729
In fact, some of the performance is disappointing in the period we test,

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:39.750
but the concepts that you'll learn are key to the work that you may do as a quant.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.560
I'll discuss each of these papers and we'll see how each can be implemented in code.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.600
I will also comment on instances where I take

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.969
a practitioner's approach to interpreting or

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.964
generalizing ideas from the academic research.

00:00:52.965 --> 00:00:58.375
In reading these papers and learning to implement Alpha factors based on their ideas,

00:00:58.375 --> 00:01:01.625
you will learn about Alpha factor building blocks

00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:05.125
that we'll refer to as overnight returns,

00:01:05.125 --> 00:01:08.275
accelerated and decelerated gains or losses,

00:01:08.275 --> 00:01:11.734
positive skew, and idiosyncratic volatility.

00:01:11.734 --> 00:01:15.799
You'll gain insights into how psychology and market mechanics

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.060
shape the hypotheses upon which these factors were built,

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.700
and also see different ways in which a factor can condition the effect of another factor.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.025
I hope that you can develop a good habit of reading academic research,

00:01:30.025 --> 00:01:34.670
proposing, and implementing, and then evaluating potential Alpha factors.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.430
These skills and experiences will serve you

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.059
well in preparing you for roles in quantitative finance.

00:01:41.058 --> 00:01:42.679
Let's get started.
