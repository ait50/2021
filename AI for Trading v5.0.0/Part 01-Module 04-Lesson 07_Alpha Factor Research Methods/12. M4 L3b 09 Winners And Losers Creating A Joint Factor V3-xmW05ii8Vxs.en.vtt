00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.009
Going back to the question I asked earlier,

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:05.549
based on whether the gain coefficient and

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.304
the accelerate coefficient are positive or negative,

00:00:08.304 --> 00:00:12.320
can you decide which scenarios we would rather go long or short?

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.940
We'll take a look at how the coefficients of

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:17.759
the stock price approximation formula can inform

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.735
our decision as to which stock we should go long or short.

00:00:21.734 --> 00:00:27.809
This in turn allows us to create an alpha factor based on these two coefficients.

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:31.079
Let's take an example of two stocks, A and B.

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:37.250
Stock A has a gain coefficient of 10 and an accelerate coefficient of two.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:45.230
Stock B also has a gain coefficient of 10 and accelerate coefficient of negative two.

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:48.239
If you were going long both stocks,

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.010
which one would you put more weight on?

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:55.144
Since stock A has the trajectory of an accelerated gain,

00:00:55.145 --> 00:00:59.090
whereas stock B looks like a decelerated gain,

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.045
we would put a larger long wait on stock A, the accelerated gain.

00:01:04.045 --> 00:01:08.210
Let's look at another example with two downward trending stocks.

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:11.989
Let's say stock C has a gain coefficient of negative

00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:15.679
10 and accelerate coefficient of two.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.150
Stock D has a gain coefficient of negative 10,

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.844
as well as an accelerate coefficient of negative two.

00:01:23.844 --> 00:01:26.375
If you were to go short both stocks,

00:01:26.375 --> 00:01:29.709
which one would you put a larger short position on?

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:35.309
In this case, stock C has the trajectory of a decelerated loss,

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.320
and stock D has the look of an accelerated loss.

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:44.794
So, you'd prefer to put a larger shortwave on stock D, the accelerated loss.

00:01:44.795 --> 00:01:48.079
Now, you may have noticed something interesting with

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.724
the signs of the gain and the accelerate coefficients.

00:01:51.724 --> 00:01:56.379
When the product of gain times accelerate is positive and large,

00:01:56.379 --> 00:02:00.859
the signal generally means to take a larger long position.

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:03.040
When both are negative,

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.240
the signal means to take a larger short position.

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:11.254
If we were to convert the gain and accelerate coefficients

00:02:11.254 --> 00:02:15.185
into ranks then multiply them together,

00:02:15.185 --> 00:02:21.265
the product of the gain times accelerate would represent an alpha factor.

00:02:21.264 --> 00:02:25.614
When the rank of gain and the rank of accelerate are both small,

00:02:25.615 --> 00:02:27.275
the product is small,

00:02:27.275 --> 00:02:31.835
and this is a signal to take a larger short position.

00:02:31.835 --> 00:02:36.540
If the rank of gain and the rank of accelerate are both large,

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:38.905
then the product is also large,

00:02:38.905 --> 00:02:42.270
and this is a signal to take a larger long wait.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.775
This is our first conditional factor.

00:02:45.775 --> 00:02:51.625
The key idea is that when you see and think conditional.

00:02:51.625 --> 00:02:56.375
Here, we have momentum and convexity.

00:02:56.375 --> 00:02:59.344
So, to summarize, we can use

00:02:59.344 --> 00:03:04.520
a multiple regression where the independent variables are time and time squared,

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.515
and the dependent variable is the stock price.

00:03:07.514 --> 00:03:13.024
This regression gives us estimates for the coefficients gain and accelerate.

00:03:13.024 --> 00:03:18.439
We create our factor by first converting gain and accelerate into ranks,

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:23.199
and then multiplying the ranks together to create a joint factor.
