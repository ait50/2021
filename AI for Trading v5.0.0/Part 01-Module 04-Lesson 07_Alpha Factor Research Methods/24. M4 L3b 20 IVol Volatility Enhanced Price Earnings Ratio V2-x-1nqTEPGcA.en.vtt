00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.809
Fundamentals such as price to earnings ratio and price to book ratios have often been

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:14.154
used in alpha factors that represent the ratio of market price to intrinsic value.

00:00:14.154 --> 00:00:18.030
We could use these fundamental factors by themselves

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.885
to indicate whether a stock is underpriced or overpriced.

00:00:21.885 --> 00:00:26.910
One thing to be aware of though when dealing with fundamentals is

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.115
that the data change much less frequently than price.

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:36.445
Fundamental values come from financial statements which,

00:00:36.445 --> 00:00:37.825
in the United States,

00:00:37.825 --> 00:00:39.910
are only updated quarterly.

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:45.319
This means that the turnover for fundamental Alphas will be likely

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.200
much lower than it is for price data-driven Alphas.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.730
Recall that this can be a positive because lower turnover means

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:00.789
less trading cost but it also could be a negative.

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.789
We won't be as responsive as the data does not arrive frequently.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.825
As a general rule,

00:01:07.825 --> 00:01:11.659
fundamental Alphas have high capacity but have

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.655
lower Sharpe ratio than compared to their price data-driven cousins.

00:01:16.655 --> 00:01:23.825
Some firms embrace this as it allows them to deploy much larger assets for clients.

00:01:23.825 --> 00:01:29.075
Other firms though can be wary of using fundamentally driven Alphas.

00:01:29.075 --> 00:01:36.159
One middle ground is to use fundamental data as a conditioning factor along with

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.984
price-driven data or to use a fundamental factor

00:01:40.984 --> 00:01:46.969
with low weight in a combined Alpha vector that includes more responsive Alphas.

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:48.814
In this case, since

00:01:48.814 --> 00:01:53.480
higher idiosyncratic volatility can indicate instances of higher mispricing,

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.115
we can combine iVol with a fundamental factor.

00:01:57.114 --> 00:02:01.339
We can think of iVol as a conditioning factor since by

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.140
itself it doesn't indicate whether to go in the long or short direction.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.395
This is an important idea,

00:02:08.395 --> 00:02:14.390
the conditional information doesn't need to be an alpha factor on its own.

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:18.199
The conditioning iVol factor can potentially be

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:22.560
used to enhance the signal of any other factor.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.199
Perhaps you can try this out in your own work.
