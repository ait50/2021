00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.004
Here's a question for you.

00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:07.759
If two stocks begin and end at the same point over a period of time,

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:10.059
does it matter how they got there?

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.835
If you ever heard the fable about the tortoise and the hare,

00:00:13.835 --> 00:00:15.935
then you might remember the saying,

00:00:15.935 --> 00:00:18.710
"slow and steady wins the race."

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.800
Maybe that idea is relevant in trading.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.605
For example, let's pretend the return of two stocks.

00:00:27.605 --> 00:00:31.375
Let's call them stock tortoise and stock rabbit.

00:00:31.375 --> 00:00:35.335
Over the same year are both plus 20 percent.

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:40.310
If we created a simple momentum factor based on the one year return,

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:45.695
this would give us the same signal for both stock tortoise and stock rabbit.

00:00:45.695 --> 00:00:51.799
What if we were to look at the trajectory of both stock tortoise and stock rabbit and

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:54.500
notice that the path they each took to

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.000
arrive at the plus 20 percent was rather different?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.039
For example, let's say stock tortoise has a linear trajectory,

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:08.269
where it incrementally increases throughout the year at a steady pace.

00:01:08.269 --> 00:01:12.804
Let's say that stock rabbit increases at a higher rate,

00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:16.965
say plus 40 percent earlier in that year,

00:01:16.965 --> 00:01:21.670
but then drops by 50 percent later in the year.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:28.349
Even though the tortoise and the rabbit reached the same point at the end of one year,

00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:30.329
both plus 20 percent,

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.480
which one might you think will do better in the next few days, weeks, or months?

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.490
In this case, do you think it's fair to hypothesize

00:01:40.489 --> 00:01:44.869
that "slow and steady wins the momentum race"?
