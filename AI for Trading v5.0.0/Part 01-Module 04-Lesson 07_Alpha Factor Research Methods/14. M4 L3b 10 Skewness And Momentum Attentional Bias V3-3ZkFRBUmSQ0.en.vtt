00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.389
The next alpha factor that I'd like to share with you is based on the paper titled,

00:00:05.389 --> 00:00:08.300
Expected Skewness and Momentum.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.440
Before we get into the formal definition of skewness,

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:15.359
I'd like to give you a hypothetical example that hopefully will guide

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:20.160
your understanding as we discuss the conditional skewness and momentum vector.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.429
Why conditional? What word do you see in the title?

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:27.350
"And", as a practitioner,

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.020
it's often helpful to think of the alpha factors in terms

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.130
of market mechanics and or behavioral psychology.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.725
If you look at which stocks are in the news,

00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:42.115
some stocks get more of press coverage and social media posts than others.

00:00:42.115 --> 00:00:45.770
Let's hypothesize that stocks that tend to get higher than

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.225
average media attention tend to also become overpriced.

00:00:50.225 --> 00:00:52.899
What might cause that mispricing?

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.634
When individual investors are flooded with news about a high flying company,

00:00:57.634 --> 00:01:04.064
there's a natural fear of missing out or "Fomo" as the kids are calling it these days.

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:10.890
This sets up investors for a situation referred to as attentional bias.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:18.079
Attentional bias is a phenomenon where people focus on some aspect at the expense of

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:21.319
focusing on the big picture and are more likely to

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:25.254
notice evidence that supports their prior existing beliefs.

00:01:25.254 --> 00:01:28.009
So, when a stock that is getting lots of

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.310
news coverage has a high one day return in the past month,

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.390
this may trigger individual investors to

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.099
see this as a sign that the stock will keep going up.

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:41.859
Their fear of missing out may kick in,

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:46.164
so they jump in and buy as well pushing the stock further up.

00:01:46.165 --> 00:01:51.245
Since this increase may not be based on fundamentals,

00:01:51.245 --> 00:01:54.770
the market as a whole both institutional investors and

00:01:54.769 --> 00:01:59.959
individual investors may realize that the stock is over bought and sell,

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:04.269
thus starting to push the stock price back down to earth.

00:02:04.269 --> 00:02:06.530
If this is indeed true,

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.719
then the maximum one day return in a historical window can be used as

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:15.500
a reversal factor which can also be combined with

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.629
momentum to decide that the stock maybe over bought or oversold.

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.030
The maximum one day return over

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.474
a month is the way that we can measure skewness of returns.

00:02:27.474 --> 00:02:30.474
We'll explain skew in the next section.

00:02:30.474 --> 00:02:33.224
Before we go to the next section though,

00:02:33.224 --> 00:02:37.609
let's pause and talk generally about alpha factors again.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.775
Many of you might be skeptical of this approach as many newcomers to call financer.

00:02:43.775 --> 00:02:47.390
Surely in the context of this specific factor,

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:50.509
you can think of a few occasions in recent memory where

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:55.655
the idea behind this factor was wrong, maybe spectacularly wrong.

00:02:55.655 --> 00:02:58.849
Meaning you can surely think of ideas where

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.150
a stock went up a lot and then continued going up.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.289
Alpha factors though are trying to capture a mispricing,

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:10.429
often imperceptible to humans across one,

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.480
many stocks two, on a relative basis,

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:17.444
and three, persistent across time.

00:03:17.444 --> 00:03:23.084
We are not trying to get very high conviction in any one specific stock.

00:03:23.085 --> 00:03:28.110
As we discussed in the section about the fundamental law of active management,

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.505
we can expect that our skill on any one stock will be low,

00:03:33.504 --> 00:03:38.849
even imperceptibly difficult to distinguish from noise by a human.

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:46.324
Skill just has to be marginally better than 50-50 at the single trait level, and then,

00:03:46.324 --> 00:03:49.579
we can apply it across many stocks to get

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.270
a complete alpha factor that hopefully exhibits good Sharpe ratio.
