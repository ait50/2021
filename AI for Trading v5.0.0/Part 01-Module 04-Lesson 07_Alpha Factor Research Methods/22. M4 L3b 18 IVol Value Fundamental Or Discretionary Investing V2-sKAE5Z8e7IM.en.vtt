00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.054
The concept of value in factor modeling is one of the two most widely known concepts,

00:00:07.054 --> 00:00:10.109
the other being the concept of momentum.

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:16.024
The significance of value can be traced to the work of Ben Graham and David Dodd,

00:00:16.024 --> 00:00:18.543
who wrote about value investing,

00:00:18.544 --> 00:00:20.820
which seeks to estimate accompanies

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.754
intrinsic value than by companies that are priced below that intrinsic value.

00:00:26.754 --> 00:00:30.250
Some well known followers of Graham in

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.965
value investing are Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger.

00:00:33.965 --> 00:00:37.310
These types of investors are referred to as

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.200
fundamental investors are also discretionary investors.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.850
Given the apparent success of value investing by discretionary investors,

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.810
quants have worked to replicate the idea by creating quantitative measures of value.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.540
Since I mentioned quants being inspired by discretionary investors,

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.789
I want to tell you about an idea I think is very misunderstood.

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:06.370
This is something I am very passionate about, most quants,

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.939
those who are new to quant

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:13.789
finance and even famous and very experienced quants often think and proclaim

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.640
loudly and even impolitely that

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.614
fundamental investors trade by gut instinct and have no process,

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:24.109
whereas quants are the standard bearers of

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:29.334
the scientific method and they are the only ones with a repeatable process.

00:01:29.334 --> 00:01:32.419
This is absolutely wrong,

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.019
I have worked with some of the best fundamental investors in the world in

00:01:36.019 --> 00:01:40.019
addition to some of the best quants and both these groups,

00:01:40.019 --> 00:01:44.664
have had irrational well-articulated, repeatable process.

00:01:44.665 --> 00:01:48.775
The key difference though between the two are: one,

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:50.594
the kind of inputs they use;

00:01:50.594 --> 00:01:53.769
two, how they process that information;

00:01:53.769 --> 00:01:58.159
and three, the shape of the portfolios that emerge.

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:05.060
Historically, fundamental investors have relied on detective work together inputs.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.620
This work includes reading corporate filings,

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.420
talking to research analysts,

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.274
and reading analyst reports.

00:02:12.275 --> 00:02:14.925
Let's think the company conference calls,

00:02:14.925 --> 00:02:17.665
talking to executives at the companies,

00:02:17.664 --> 00:02:20.224
and even visiting companies on-site.

00:02:20.224 --> 00:02:25.405
Fundamental investors then synthesize all this information into a variant view,

00:02:25.405 --> 00:02:27.835
which is a non-consensus view.

00:02:27.835 --> 00:02:32.814
The shape of portfolios differ between fundamental investors and quant investors.

00:02:32.814 --> 00:02:34.419
When I refer to shape,

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:38.809
I mean the number of positions and also the concentration of those position.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.055
Think of the shape function in the Python library pandas.

00:02:43.055 --> 00:02:47.025
Great fundamental investors have high IC,

00:02:47.025 --> 00:02:48.585
the measure of skill.

00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:52.159
But, because of the style and depth of their research process,

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:56.180
they can only achieve low breadth because it's only humanly

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.340
possible to research so many companies with that much depth.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.314
But, make no mistake,

00:03:03.314 --> 00:03:06.370
these investors use repeatable inputs,

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.134
follow a repeatable process and produce high IC bets.

00:03:12.134 --> 00:03:14.014
Quants on the other hand,

00:03:14.014 --> 00:03:18.784
have historically used structured data like price and volume data,

00:03:18.784 --> 00:03:24.129
financial statement data, quantified a research analyst ratings, and the like.

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:28.519
As discussed, quants typically have lower IC,

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.880
but more than make up for that with much higher breadth.
