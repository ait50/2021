00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.479
You did it. This lesson was pretty advanced,

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.519
but also very meaningful in that we practice reading academic research,

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:13.174
thinking about Alpha ideas based on the papers,

00:00:13.175 --> 00:00:15.610
and then coding up these factors.

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:20.460
I want to emphasize that the value of this lesson isn't that I'm giving

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.335
you four Alpha factors that will help you become an instant millionaire.

00:00:25.335 --> 00:00:29.960
The value that I hope you'll derive from this lesson is an understanding of

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.780
the process and thinking that quants go through to generate Alphas every day on the job.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.380
Remember, we're teaching you how to fish for

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.719
Alpha factors instead of just giving you the Alpha factors.

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:46.920
As the saying goes,

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.410
"Give your students an Alpha factor and they'll have a good Alpha factor for

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:56.114
a day or at least until their Alpha factor turns into a common risk factor."

00:00:56.115 --> 00:00:59.899
Teach your students how to fish for their own Alpha factors

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.560
and they'll hopefully have good Alpha factors for a lifetime.
