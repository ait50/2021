00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
Let's walk through four hypothetical examples

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.050
and assume that skewness is a reversal factor,

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:08.384
which is another word for mean reversion.

00:00:08.384 --> 00:00:10.679
We'll be more specific and say that

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.140
the maximum daily return over the trailing month is our measure of skew.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:21.899
Let's also assume that the return over the trailing year is a momentum vector.

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:24.729
Notice that it's more precise to call

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.265
our definition of skew as a measure of positive skew.

00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:34.460
We aren't defining negative skew with a minimum over the trailing month.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.939
Even though this is also a valid approach,

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:42.284
for simplicity, we'll just be measuring positive skew.

00:00:42.284 --> 00:00:48.719
Remember, the Alpha vector is a relative ranking exercise.

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.990
In our first scenario,

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.234
let's say momentum is positive and skew is positive.

00:00:55.234 --> 00:01:00.265
This is the scenario that we saw in the introduction to this factor.

00:01:00.265 --> 00:01:03.439
We can think of the positive skew as having

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:08.564
a dampening effect on the positive momentum of the stock.

00:01:08.564 --> 00:01:12.920
The paper calls this weakened momentum.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.870
For our second scenario,

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.555
let's say momentum is still positive,

00:01:17.555 --> 00:01:20.624
but the skew is less positive.

00:01:20.623 --> 00:01:24.459
The less positive skew may indicate that

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:30.789
future returns maybe stronger than if there were a positive skew.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.575
The paper calls this enhanced momentum.

00:01:34.575 --> 00:01:36.659
For our third scenario,

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.459
we'll look at negative momentum and positive skew.

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:46.789
The paper describes this scenario by suggesting a phenomenon where investors are overly

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:54.235
optimistic about a downward trending stock when the stock bounces backup temporarily.

00:01:54.234 --> 00:01:59.890
The hypothesis continues to suggest that when the stock rebounds positively,

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:06.060
individual investors may see this as a sign of recovery so they may buy as well.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.814
To conclude this scenario,

00:02:07.813 --> 00:02:11.094
as fundamental still put downward pressure on the stock,

00:02:11.094 --> 00:02:16.879
the momentum then reasserts itself and the stock continues to slide downward.

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:22.579
This scenario is also referred to as enhanced momentum and is

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.160
the primary scenario for which the researchers

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:29.275
found more significant effect of skewness on momentum.

00:02:29.275 --> 00:02:31.245
For our fourth scenario,

00:02:31.245 --> 00:02:34.740
we'll look at negative momentum and less positive skew.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.250
The less positive skew has a dampening effect on the negative momentum,

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.800
so it can be referred to as weakened momentum.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.330
Now that you've seen how momentum and skew interact,

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.320
can you think of how these can be combined into a conditional factor?
