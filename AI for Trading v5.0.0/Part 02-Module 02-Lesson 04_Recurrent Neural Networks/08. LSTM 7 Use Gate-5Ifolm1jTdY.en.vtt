00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.169
And finally, we come to the use gate or output gate.

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:06.540
This is the one that uses the long term memory that just came out

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.914
of the forget gate and the short term memory that just came out of the learned gate,

00:00:09.914 --> 00:00:13.389
to come up with a new short term memory and an output.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.140
These are the same thing.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.190
In this case, we'll take what's useful from

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.057
the long term memory which is this bear over here,

00:00:20.056 --> 00:00:23.504
and what's useful from the short term memory which is these dark wolf,

00:00:23.504 --> 00:00:28.114
and the squirrel, and that's what's going to be our new short term memory.

00:00:28.114 --> 00:00:29.673
So our output basically says,

00:00:29.673 --> 00:00:32.015
your image is most likely a wolf but

00:00:32.015 --> 00:00:34.990
it also carry some of the other animals that I've seen recently.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.440
And mathematically what this does is the following: it applies

00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:40.349
a small neural network on the output of

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.679
the forget gate using the tanh activation function,

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:47.130
and it applies to another small neural network on the short term memory

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.955
and the events using the sigmoid activation function.

00:00:50.954 --> 00:00:52.549
And as a final step,

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:55.890
it multiplies these two in order to get the new output.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.134
The output also worth of the new short term memory.

00:00:59.134 --> 00:01:01.039
And that's how they use gate works.
