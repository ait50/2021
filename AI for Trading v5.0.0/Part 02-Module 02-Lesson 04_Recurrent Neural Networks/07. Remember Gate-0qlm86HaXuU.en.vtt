00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.479
And now we're going to learn the Remember Gate. This one is the simplest.

00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:06.150
It take the long-term memory coming out of the Forget Gate and

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.570
the short-term memory coming out of the Learn Gate and simply combines them together.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.009
And how does this work mathematically? Again, very simple.

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.190
We just take the outputs coming from the Forget Gate

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.460
and from the Learn Gate and we just add them.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.730
That's it, that's all we do.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.010
And that's how the Remember Gate works.
