00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.370
So here we go. As we've seen before,

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.878
here is the architecture for an LSTM with the four gates.

00:00:05.878 --> 00:00:07.003
There is the forget gate,

00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:09.993
which takes the long-term memory and forgets part of it.

00:00:09.993 --> 00:00:12.599
The learn gate puts the short-term memory together with

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.035
the event as the information we've recently learned.

00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:20.070
The remember gate joins the long-term memory that we haven't yet forgotten plus

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.760
the new information we've learned in order to update our long-term memory and output it.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.629
And finally, the use gate also takes the information we just

00:00:27.629 --> 00:00:30.719
learned together with long-term memory we haven't yet forgotten,

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:34.875
and it uses it to make a prediction and update the short-term memory.

00:00:34.875 --> 00:00:36.734
So this is how it looks all put together.

00:00:36.734 --> 00:00:38.993
It's not so complicated after all, isn't it?

00:00:38.993 --> 00:00:40.695
Now you may be thinking, wait a minute,

00:00:40.695 --> 00:00:42.350
this looks too arbitrary.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.520
Why use tanh sometimes and sigmoid other times?

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.574
Why multiply sometimes and add other times,

00:00:47.573 --> 00:00:50.369
and other times apply a more complicated linear function?

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:52.169
You can probably think of different architectures that

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.329
make more sense or that are simpler,

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.908
and you are absolutely right.

00:00:55.908 --> 00:00:57.613
This is an arbitrary construction.

00:00:57.613 --> 00:00:59.339
And as many things in machine learning,

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.170
the reason why it is like this is because it works.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.349
And in the following section,

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:06.689
we'll see some other architectures which can be simpler

00:01:06.688 --> 00:01:09.818
or more complex and that also do the job.

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:12.180
But you're welcome to look for others and experiment.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.819
This is an area very much under development so if you come up

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:18.000
with a different architecture and it works, that is wonderful.
