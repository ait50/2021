00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.814
Now, we go to the Forget Gate,

00:00:01.814 --> 00:00:03.584
this one works as follows: It takes

00:00:03.584 --> 00:00:08.035
a long term memory and it decides what parts to keep and to forget.

00:00:08.035 --> 00:00:11.519
In this case, the show is about nature and science and the forget gate decides to

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.724
forget that the show is about science and keep the fact that it's about nature.

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:18.009
How does the Forget Gate work mathematically?

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:23.054
Very simple. The long-term memory (LTM) from time T minus 1 comes in,

00:00:23.053 --> 00:00:24.538
and it gets multiplied by

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.885
a Forget Factor ft. And how does the forget factor ft get calculated?

00:00:29.885 --> 00:00:31.350
Well, simple. We'll use

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.469
a short term memory STM and the event information to calculate ft.

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:37.859
So, just as before,

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:42.118
we run a small one layer neural network with a linear function combined with

00:00:42.118 --> 00:00:44.173
the sigmoid function to calculate

00:00:44.173 --> 00:00:47.570
this Forget Factor and that's how the Forget Gate works.
