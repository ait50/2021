00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.060
You now have learned how to set up a null and alternative hypothesis.

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:08.339
You have determined type one and type two errors.

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:12.721
And you can calculate which hypothesis you should choose based on error threshold.

00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:15.809
You also have learned about some of the dangers of the conclusions

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.240
that you might make when having a really large sample size,

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:23.009
or if you were to perform more than one hypothesis tests.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.740
Finally, you learned how confidence intervals and

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.164
hypothesis tests are highly related to one another.

00:00:29.164 --> 00:00:32.549
The ideas associated with hypothesis tests are central to

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:36.195
A/B testing and making database business decisions.

00:00:36.195 --> 00:00:37.844
In the next lesson,

00:00:37.844 --> 00:00:41.000
you will take a hands-on approach to applying these ideas.
