00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.615
You've learned about the types of errors that are possible on hypothesis testing.

00:00:06.615 --> 00:00:08.820
And you've learned about how we can create

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.995
a threshold for how often we allow these to happen.

00:00:11.994 --> 00:00:16.594
But consider if we run 20 of the exact same types of hypothesis tests.

00:00:16.594 --> 00:00:19.474
Even if the null is actually true,

00:00:19.475 --> 00:00:21.679
if we have a five percent type one error rate,

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:26.320
we can expect one of these to have results where we choose the alternative.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.199
Often, researchers all over the world are performing very similar studies.

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.054
So when one researcher comes up with significant results,

00:00:34.054 --> 00:00:37.189
how can we be sure that they are one of these type one errors?

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:40.549
Well, the hard part is we can't really know in many cases.

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:43.399
And that's a problem. But there are a few methods that

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.695
statisticians have come up with to assist with this problem.

00:00:46.695 --> 00:00:51.674
One of the most conservative and common approaches is known as the Bonferroni Correction.

00:00:51.674 --> 00:00:55.519
This simple correction says that if you're performing m-tests,

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.830
you should divide your type one error rate by

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.894
m to assure that you actually maintain the error rate here.

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:03.050
So if you really want to have

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:07.280
a five percent type one error rate and you're performing 10 hypothesis test,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.980
your new threshold is actually 0.5 percent for choosing the alternative hypothesis.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.560
This is just one popular correction method.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.454
But other methods include the Tukey correction.

00:01:18.454 --> 00:01:19.993
And in the biomedical field,

00:01:19.993 --> 00:01:22.480
they commonly use a method called Q-Values.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.460
More on these methods is provided in the instructor notes below.
