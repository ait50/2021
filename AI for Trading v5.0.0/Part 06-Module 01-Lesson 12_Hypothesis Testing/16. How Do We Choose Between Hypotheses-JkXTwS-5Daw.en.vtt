00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
Once we set up our null and alternative hypotheses,

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.040
we need used data to figure out

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.765
which hypothesis we actually think is more likely to be true.

00:00:08.765 --> 00:00:12.780
And there are two ways we might approach choosing one of these hypotheses.

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:15.419
One is the approach that we saw using confidence intervals,

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:18.640
where we simulate the sampling distribution of our statistic,

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.060
and then we could see if our hypothesis is

00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:24.419
consistent with what we observe in the sampling distribution.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.340
The second way we could approach choosing

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:29.190
a hypothesis is simulating what we believe to be

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:35.100
possible under the null and then seeing if our data is actually consistent with that.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.000
This is what professionals tend to do in a hypothesis testing.
