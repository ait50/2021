00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:03.950
In the previous video,

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.246
you saw two methods for how we might choose between competing hypotheses.

00:00:08.246 --> 00:00:09.589
In the second method,

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:13.035
we ask the question if the null hypothesis is true,

00:00:13.035 --> 00:00:16.039
what is the probability of obtaining the statistic we observed in

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.674
our data or one more extreme in favor of the alternative hypothesis?

00:00:20.675 --> 00:00:23.585
This probability is what is called a P-value.

00:00:23.585 --> 00:00:27.740
Finding the P-value involves a mix of ideas that you've learned about,

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:31.779
sampling distributions and conditional probability.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.350
Imagine we have a null that a population mean is equal to zero.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.510
Then we collect sample data and we find the sample mean

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:42.259
to be five and the sample standard deviation to be two.

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:47.121
Assuming the sampling distribution of your statistic follows the null hypothesis.

00:00:47.121 --> 00:00:49.310
What is the probability of observing

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.525
the actual value of the statistic from your data in this distribution?

00:00:54.524 --> 00:00:56.030
If we want to know the probability that

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.655
the population mean is actually greater than zero,

00:00:58.655 --> 00:01:00.995
you could update the hypothesis.

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:03.018
Values like 6, 7,

00:01:03.018 --> 00:01:09.510
10 all fall out here and are even more of an indication that the alternative is true,

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.260
that our population mean is greater than zero.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.719
Additionally, what is the probability you observed

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:18.084
something even more in favor of the alternative hypothesis?

00:01:18.084 --> 00:01:22.879
This shaded region here provides that probability, the P-value.

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:25.909
Notice the P-value is dependent on

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:31.079
your alternative hypothesis as it determines what is considered more extreme.

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.984
If your alternative hypothesis is that your parameter is greater than zero,

00:01:34.984 --> 00:01:38.359
then we shade greater than the statistic as shown here.

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:42.515
However, if we change our null and alternative to look like this,

00:01:42.515 --> 00:01:45.144
then we shade to the left of our statistic.

00:01:45.144 --> 00:01:48.500
Our shading for the P-value would now look like this.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.500
Notice that this would create a very large probability in

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.754
this case as almost the entire distribution is shaded.

00:01:54.754 --> 00:01:57.304
And if you have a not equal sign in the alternative,

00:01:57.305 --> 00:02:00.012
then your shading is associated with extremes that

00:02:00.012 --> 00:02:03.194
are just far from the null in either direction.

00:02:03.194 --> 00:02:05.359
In these cases, we just care about

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:09.104
statistics that are far from the null in either direction.

00:02:09.104 --> 00:02:11.929
So we end up marking on both sides and

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.730
shading away from the null hypothesis to find our P-value.

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:18.484
This often takes people a while to wrap their heads around.

00:02:18.485 --> 00:02:21.075
And there are two parts to understand.

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:25.424
First, you have to fully conceptualize the definition of a P-value,

00:02:25.425 --> 00:02:31.040
which is the conditional probability of your data given that the null hypothesis is true.

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:34.069
Then, you need to figure out what to compute,

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.534
which is visually summarized by these three images.

00:02:37.534 --> 00:02:40.460
You will get some practice with both of these before moving

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.000
on and applying the ideas of P-value to make decisions.
