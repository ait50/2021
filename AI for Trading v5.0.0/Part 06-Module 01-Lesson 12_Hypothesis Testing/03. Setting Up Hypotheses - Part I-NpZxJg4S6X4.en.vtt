00:00:01.929 --> 00:00:04.790
When performing hypothesis testing,

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.899
the first thing we need to do is translate a question into two competing hypotheses.

00:00:10.898 --> 00:00:13.414
One of these hypotheses is called the Null,

00:00:13.414 --> 00:00:15.404
and it's associated with the symbol,

00:00:15.404 --> 00:00:20.210
and the other is called the Alternative and it's commonly notated in this way.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.719
Setting up these hypotheses can be a bit subjective,

00:00:23.719 --> 00:00:26.404
but here are a few general rules that will go through.

00:00:26.405 --> 00:00:32.789
The null hypothesis is the condition we believe to be true before we collect any data.

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:36.019
Mathematically, the null hypothesis is commonly

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.790
a statement of two groups being equal or of an effect being zero.

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:42.890
The null and the alternative hypotheses should be

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.299
competing and non overlapping hypotheses.

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:48.859
The alternative hypothesis is often

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:53.185
associated with what you want or what you want to prove to be true.

00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:56.150
Mathematically, the null hypothesis tends to hold

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.449
an equal sign while the alternative holds a greater than,

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.435
less than, or not equal to sign.

00:01:02.435 --> 00:01:06.394
We will go through a couple of examples to connect these ideas to.

00:01:06.394 --> 00:01:11.399
In the US judicial system we say "Innocent until proven guilty."

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.675
This is actually a setup for a hypothesis test.

00:01:14.674 --> 00:01:16.379
In a judicial case,

00:01:16.379 --> 00:01:21.304
every individual is either innocent or guilty of an act.

00:01:21.305 --> 00:01:24.200
This statement of "Innocent until proven

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.935
guilty" is a statement that says "We believe everyone to be

00:01:27.935 --> 00:01:36.415
innocent initially" that is the null hypothesis for every individual is innocent.

00:01:36.415 --> 00:01:40.700
It is this statement we believe to be true before we collect any data.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.600
Therefore, the competing alternative hypothesis is that an individual is guilty.

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:53.059
We then collect evidence or data and use this data to see which hypothesis is supported.
