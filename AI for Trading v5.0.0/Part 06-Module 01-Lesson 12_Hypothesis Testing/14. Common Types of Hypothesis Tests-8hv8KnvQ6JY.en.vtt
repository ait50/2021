00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.764
Now that you've had a chance to gain some familiarity with setting up hypothesis test,

00:00:04.764 --> 00:00:08.417
let's look at some of the most common tests that are done in practice.

00:00:08.417 --> 00:00:10.989
One common test is to test the mean or

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.675
proportion of a population being equal to some value.

00:00:14.675 --> 00:00:16.870
For example, in finance,

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:17.964
we could have the question of,

00:00:17.964 --> 00:00:22.280
if you can expect a return greater than six percent on an investment.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.377
So we could set up the hypothesis test in the following way,

00:00:25.376 --> 00:00:29.519
where the null is that you earn less than or equal to six percent,

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.079
and the alternative is that you earn greater than six percent.

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.265
Another common hypothesis test is to ask which of

00:00:36.265 --> 00:00:39.804
two marketing campaigns might drive more traffic to our website?

00:00:39.804 --> 00:00:43.295
In which case, we could set up a null and alternative that looks like this,

00:00:43.295 --> 00:00:46.690
where the null suggests that the proportion of individuals that click

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:50.229
through to our page is the same for each campaign,

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:53.694
and the alternative is that one page drives more traffic.

00:00:53.695 --> 00:00:58.840
In which case, the proportion of traffic is different from one page to the next.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.070
If we really wanted to test if a new campaign was better than an old campaign,

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.310
we might use a one sided hypothesis test like this one,

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.840
where the greater than here,

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.420
suggests that the proportion of individuals that travel

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.674
to our site will be higher for the new campaign.

00:01:13.674 --> 00:01:18.429
You can do some algebra to change the exact same logic to look like this.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.660
Notice that all of these hypothesis tests are regarding parameters.

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.939
They are not about statistics.

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:26.840
This is always the case.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.990
There is no need to do hypothesis testing on

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:33.034
statistics as they are exact values in our data set.

00:01:33.034 --> 00:01:36.549
Our questions are about the entire population and therefore,

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.000
so are our hypotheses.
