00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.275
Hopefully, you're starting to feel more comfortable

00:00:05.275 --> 00:00:08.830
identifying hypotheses and the types of errors that you can make.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.775
In this video, we'll go through one more example to iterate on these ideas.

00:00:13.775 --> 00:00:16.375
This example is one that really helped me connect

00:00:16.375 --> 00:00:20.199
all the dots of hypotheses testing and type I and type II errors.

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.265
I hope it does the same for you.

00:00:22.265 --> 00:00:24.160
Imagine you own a skydiving shop.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.750
And as a part of your job,

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.954
you must check parachutes to assure they worked correctly.

00:00:28.954 --> 00:00:31.038
There are two potential outcomes,

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.945
either a parachute works or it doesn't.

00:00:33.945 --> 00:00:37.545
You can create these as our two potential hypotheses.

00:00:37.545 --> 00:00:43.359
You know that there are four potential outcomes for each skydiver-parachute combination.

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:47.659
First, you check each parachute to make a decision.

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:51.009
Either the parachute works or it doesn't.

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:52.614
If you determine that it works,

00:00:52.615 --> 00:00:55.690
you put it on the shelf for skydivers to use.

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:58.129
If it doesn't, you throw it out.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.913
Now, there are two possible truths,

00:01:00.912 --> 00:01:04.569
either the parachute actually works or it doesn't.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.494
For the parachute that we threw out, if it doesn't work,

00:01:07.495 --> 00:01:09.594
that's great, but if it did,

00:01:09.594 --> 00:01:12.155
then we probably lost like 30 bucks.

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:15.236
Now, for the parachute we put on the shelf,

00:01:15.236 --> 00:01:17.649
if it works, then the skydiver uses it

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.795
to jump out of a plane and land safely on the ground.

00:01:20.795 --> 00:01:22.379
However, if it doesn't,

00:01:22.379 --> 00:01:25.909
we clearly just committed the worst type of error possible.

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.854
This should clearly be the type I error in this example.

00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:32.090
So, the other type of error is the type II error.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.359
This helps us align our null and alternative hypotheses to look like this.

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:38.769
As we know that type I error rate should be

00:01:38.769 --> 00:01:41.869
choosing the alternative when the null is true.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.189
And it helps us align an appropriate type I error rate as

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.685
one or five percent as entirely too high.

00:01:48.685 --> 00:01:51.909
Committing five or even one of these errors out

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.000
of every 100 individuals would just be unacceptable.
