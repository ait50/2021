Welcome to this lesson on hypothesis testing.

00:00:03.984 --> 00:00:07.029
Hypothesis testing is one of my favorite topics,

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:11.390
because it really does bring an art to the way that we think about statistics.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.105
This can bring a lot of complexity.

00:00:13.105 --> 00:00:16.899
And you may need to watch videos in the section multiple times,

00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:20.494
or practice the quizzes multiple times.

00:00:20.495 --> 00:00:24.000
But this is a really rewarding subject to master.
