00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.525
When conducting a hypothesis test,

00:00:04.525 --> 00:00:07.544
there are really two components that you have control over.

00:00:07.544 --> 00:00:09.745
First, you should be asking yourself,

00:00:09.744 --> 00:00:13.404
is my sample representative of my population of interest?

00:00:13.404 --> 00:00:15.459
Are there ways to assure that everyone in

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.519
my population is accurately represented in my sample?

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.059
If your sample isn't representative,

00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:25.390
then your conclusions are likely to be incorrect.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.929
Second, you should know the impact of your sample size,

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:31.179
and the role that it plays on your results.

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:33.320
As your sample size increases,

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.259
even the smallest differences between

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:38.875
the two groups will appear as notable and statistically significant.

00:00:38.875 --> 00:00:42.520
With the really large sample sizes that are becoming more frequent,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.080
as a part of the data world,

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:46.719
we are seeing a large change in techniques

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:50.469
away from hypothesis tests for exactly this reason.

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:55.030
Imagine we are interested in which of two coffee types will sell better on the shelf,

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.935
and on average, maybe type one sells better than type two.

00:00:58.935 --> 00:01:01.539
However, there are hundreds, thousands,

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:06.204
maybe even millions of individuals who still prefer a different type.

00:01:06.204 --> 00:01:08.709
A hypothesis test just tells us that,

00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:11.529
on average, type one will sell more than type two.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.359
But with large sample sizes,

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:15.159
we should do better than this.

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:20.754
Discussing averages leaves out an entire part of the population who preferred type two,

00:01:20.754 --> 00:01:23.049
or maybe did not care for either of these types,

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:24.759
but like a different type.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.410
But with large sample sizes,

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:27.634
we can do better than this.

00:01:27.635 --> 00:01:29.650
We can do better than hypothesis testing.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.380
And this is what more and more people are finding out.

00:01:32.379 --> 00:01:36.054
Using machine learning, we can individualize an approach.

00:01:36.055 --> 00:01:39.100
So maybe, we sell twenty types of coffee and we know

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:42.444
what type every member in our population wants.

00:01:42.444 --> 00:01:46.994
So these large sample sizes prove to be pretty detrimental to a hypothesis test,

00:01:46.995 --> 00:01:48.925
but they are spectacular for

00:01:48.924 --> 00:01:52.825
individual-aimed approaches using machine learning techniques.

00:01:52.825 --> 00:01:55.290
We will get a glimpse of two of

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.000
these machine learning techniques in the last lessons of this class.
