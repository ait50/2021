00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:04.230
In the last video,

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.890
we saw that a p-value is the probability of obtaining

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:10.709
our data or more extreme values from the null hypothesis.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.755
So how does this connect to making decisions and the types of errors that we can make?

00:00:15.755 --> 00:00:18.185
If the p-value is really small,

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:22.474
this suggests it's less likely to observe our statistic from the null.

00:00:22.475 --> 00:00:25.505
And it's more likely that it came from the alternative.

00:00:25.504 --> 00:00:27.980
But how small does the p-value need to be

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.080
before we no longer stay with the null hypothesis?

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:36.045
Well, I guess that depends on how willing you are to make certain types of errors.

00:00:36.045 --> 00:00:39.065
If you are willing to commit five percent of errors,

00:00:39.064 --> 00:00:41.585
where you choose the alternative incorrectly,

00:00:41.585 --> 00:00:43.789
then your p-value needs to be smaller than

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.085
this threshold in order to choose the alternative.

00:00:47.085 --> 00:00:50.719
However, if your probability of getting the data from the null is, say,

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:52.265
an eight percent chance,

00:00:52.265 --> 00:00:54.710
this is enough of a chance that you would stay with

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.905
the null under a five percent type one error threshold.

00:00:57.905 --> 00:01:02.183
The fast rule is that if our p-value is less than a type one error rate,

00:01:02.183 --> 00:01:04.524
then professionals say we reject the null.

00:01:04.525 --> 00:01:07.660
That is, we choose the alternative hypothesis.

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.474
If the p-value is greater than our type one error rate,

00:01:10.474 --> 00:01:12.459
then we fail to reject the null.

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:15.564
That is, we stay with the null hypothesis as our decision.

00:01:15.564 --> 00:01:17.259
What's actually true?

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.115
We can't really be sure in practice,

00:01:19.114 --> 00:01:22.039
but we now have a database way to make our decisions.
