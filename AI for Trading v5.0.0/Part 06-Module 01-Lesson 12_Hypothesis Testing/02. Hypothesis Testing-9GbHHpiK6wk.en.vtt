00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:07.415
Academic and industry professionals have questions about,

00:00:07.415 --> 00:00:09.439
well, just about everything.

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:13.164
As data analysts, we try to help them answer these questions.

00:00:13.164 --> 00:00:17.750
But first, we need to translate the questions into what are known as hypothesis.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.809
Then, we need to be able to collect data to

00:00:20.809 --> 00:00:24.309
justify which hypothesis are likely to be true.

00:00:24.309 --> 00:00:26.689
As an example, just the other day,

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.234
I was in a debate with a friend,

00:00:28.234 --> 00:00:31.339
about what the most popular ice cream flavor in the world is?

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:34.271
Where I assumed, the most popular was chocolate,

00:00:34.271 --> 00:00:36.560
and they were sure it was vanilla.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.420
In this case, we could generate

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.899
hypothesis where the most favorite ice cream is chocolate,

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.960
and collect data to see if this hypothesis is actually supported by the data.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.870
But how can we truly know this unless we talk to everyone?

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:53.424
How do we know if our conclusions are reliable?

00:00:53.424 --> 00:00:54.679
Well, it turns out,

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:56.494
you can use hypothesis testing,

00:00:56.494 --> 00:00:59.745
or confidence intervals which you just saw in the last lesson,

00:00:59.746 --> 00:01:01.940
to draw conclusions about a population,

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:04.879
only using sample data.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.074
Not all hypothesis testing is this straightforward.

00:01:08.075 --> 00:01:11.000
Within medical studies, say I wanted to test if

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.120
a cancer drug is effective at helping patients.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.090
Well now, the hypothesis could go lots of different ways.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.670
Is the drug helpful if it makes patients feel better?

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.530
Is it helpful if they live longer?

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.140
Is it helpful if it reduces the tumor sizes?

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.930
In this lesson, you will learn about how to

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.320
set up and evaluate the results of hypothesis testing.

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:34.399
Hypothesis testing is all about helping businesses make

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.000
better and more informed database decisions. So let's get started.
