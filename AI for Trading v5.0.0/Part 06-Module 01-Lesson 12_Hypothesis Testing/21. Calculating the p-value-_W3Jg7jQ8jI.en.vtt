00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.950
In the last programming video,

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.339
you saw how we could simulate draws from the null hypothesis,

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.129
and that if our statistic was in the bulk of the distribution,

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.485
this suggested that the statistic was likely from that null.

00:00:13.484 --> 00:00:17.649
However, if the statistic was farther out from the bulk of the distribution,

00:00:17.649 --> 00:00:22.765
this suggested that the null wasn't likely to have generated our statistic.

00:00:22.765 --> 00:00:28.000
Then you saw that we can calculate p-values based on the shaded region starting at

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.926
the value of our observed statistic through the tail of the distribution,

00:00:32.926 --> 00:00:36.490
where the shaded region is dependent on our alternative.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.740
Based on the previous video,

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.690
you had simulated values of the sampling distribution from the null, like this.

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:45.849
Imagine that we have the alternative hypothesis

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.585
that the population mean is greater than 70,

00:00:48.585 --> 00:00:51.579
then we could calculate the p-value as the proportion

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.375
of the simulated draws that are larger than our sample mean.

00:00:55.375 --> 00:00:59.579
Here, you can see that that would give us a p-value of one.

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.769
Remember, large p-value suggests that we shouldn't move away from the null hypothesis.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.723
In this case, that suggests that we should stay with the mean being less than 70.

00:01:10.724 --> 00:01:15.079
Here, we've calculated the null values that are greater than our sample mean.

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:16.700
Since this is one,

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.260
our p-value is large and therefore we wouldn't move away from the null hypothesis

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.905
that suggests that our population mean is truly less than or equal to 70.

00:01:26.905 --> 00:01:31.265
If our new null and alternative hypotheses look like this instead,

00:01:31.265 --> 00:01:33.995
we would calculate our p-value a little differently.

00:01:33.995 --> 00:01:37.385
Here, because our alternative is less than 70,

00:01:37.385 --> 00:01:41.505
we would now look at the shaded region to the left of our statistic.

00:01:41.504 --> 00:01:44.140
This would change our p-value to the following.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.870
Now that our p-value is zero,

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.847
this suggests that we reject the null hypothesis in favor of an alternative,

00:01:50.847 --> 00:01:55.400
suggesting that the population mean is less than 70.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.905
So if this was our null and alternative hypothesis,

00:01:57.905 --> 00:02:01.820
we would now want to look at the values that are more extreme

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:06.125
than our sample mean in either direction away from the null hypothesis.

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:08.354
That looks like this equation here.

00:02:08.354 --> 00:02:12.625
Let's take a look at where these values fall on the above histogram.

00:02:12.625 --> 00:02:16.324
You can see that if we were to shade more extreme than either of these regions,

00:02:16.324 --> 00:02:18.319
there are essentially no data points from

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.344
our null hypothesis that fall outside of this region.

00:02:21.344 --> 00:02:23.780
Again, we would have evidence to suggest that

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.030
the null hypothesized value did not generate our sample statistic.
