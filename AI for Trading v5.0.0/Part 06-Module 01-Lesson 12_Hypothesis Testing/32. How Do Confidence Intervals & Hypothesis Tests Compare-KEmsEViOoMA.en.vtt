00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:07.209
So you saw earlier that hypothesis tests and confidence intervals are pretty similar.

00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:11.339
But you might be surprised just how similar these two techniques are.

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:13.109
It turns out that if you are to do

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:17.189
a hypothesis test that contains a not equal in alternative hypothesis,

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.596
your conclusions are identical to a confidence interval,

00:00:20.596 --> 00:00:23.250
as long as 100 minus your confidence interval level

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.655
is the same as the type one error rate in your hypothesis test.

00:00:26.655 --> 00:00:30.743
That is, if you build a 95 percent confidence interval,

00:00:30.742 --> 00:00:31.979
this is the same as doing

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.924
a two-sided hypothesis test with a five percent type one error rate,

00:00:35.924 --> 00:00:39.000
and building a 99 percent confidence interval will provide

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.909
the same results as a hypothesis test with a one percent type one error rate.

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:46.469
With this in mind, many academic journals are moving away

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.789
from hypothesis tests as they find the results are often misinterpreted.

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.504
Instead, more and more confidence intervals and

00:00:53.505 --> 00:00:58.135
other statistics like effect size or machine learning techniques are being used.

00:00:58.134 --> 00:01:00.809
There is more information on effect sizes as well as

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.705
