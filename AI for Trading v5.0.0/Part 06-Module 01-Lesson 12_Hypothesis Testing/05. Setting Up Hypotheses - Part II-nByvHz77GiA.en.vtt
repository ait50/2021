00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.320
In the previous video,

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.940
you were introduced to the terms of

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.820
the null and alternative hypotheses and

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.769
came up with a few guidelines for setting these up as shown here.

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.539
You also saw how the claim of innocent until

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:18.989
proven guilty relates to the null and alternative hypotheses.

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:22.804
In this video, I want to provide a second example.

00:00:22.804 --> 00:00:26.989
Imagine you create a new web page layout and we'd like

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:31.169
to know if this new page drives more traffic than the existing page.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.500
We could set this up to specifically ask,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.289
"Does the average web traffic increase

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:39.560
with the new web page as compared to the existing page?"

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.020
Before we even implement this test,

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.555
we might hope that the new page is better.

00:00:44.554 --> 00:00:46.689
That's why we built it after all.

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:48.594
But we need to prove this.

00:00:48.594 --> 00:00:51.170
This is an indication that the new page being

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.700
better than the existing page belongs in the alternative hypothesis.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.390
Therefore, the null would be that the average web traffic is the

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.965
same for each of these groups or that the old page is actually better.

00:01:03.965 --> 00:01:06.920
Mathematically, we could set this up in this way,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.540
where the average traffic for

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.815
the existing page is equal to the average traffic for the new page.

00:01:12.814 --> 00:01:15.274
Then, the alternative would look like this,

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:17.900
where the average traffic for the new page is

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.140
greater than the average traffic for the existing page.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.730
And again, we can collect data to see which hypothesis is supported.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:31.070
Here, our guidelines served very useful in defining the null and alternative hypotheses.

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:36.769
Setting up hypothesis tests can be tricky because there isn't really one right answer.

00:01:36.769 --> 00:01:38.179
In the following concepts,

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.840
you will see why this really matters for our decision-making process.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.420
For now, use this example along with

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.000
these four guidelines to get some practice setting up hypotheses.
