00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.919
From the quizzes, you've now been introduced to two types of errors.

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:09.214
Type one and type two errors.

00:00:09.214 --> 00:00:12.484
Correctly setting up the null and alternative hypotheses

00:00:12.484 --> 00:00:15.320
is important for exactly this reason.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.740
They define the importance of the errors that we're making.

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:20.539
In the previous example,

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.155
a type one error is one where we decided that an individual is guilty,

00:00:24.155 --> 00:00:26.270
but they're actually innocent.

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.399
The definition of a type one error is

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:31.339
an error where the alternative hypothesis is chosen,

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:34.344
but the null hypothesis is actually true.

00:00:34.344 --> 00:00:36.109
You might also hear this called,

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:40.655
a false-positive, and it is frequently denoted with a symbol alpha.

00:00:40.655 --> 00:00:45.429
Type one errors are considered the worse of the two possible errors.

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:47.670
The other type of error that might occur,

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.545
is that we might set a guilty individual free.

00:00:50.545 --> 00:00:52.325
This is a type two error.

00:00:52.325 --> 00:00:57.065
By definition, a type two error is when the null hypothesis is chosen,

00:00:57.064 --> 00:00:59.449
and the alternative is actually true.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.640
What we can see in this example is that there are two potential extremes.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.585
The jury might decide that they never want to commit a type one error, in which case,

00:01:08.584 --> 00:01:10.234
regardless of the evidence,

00:01:10.234 --> 00:01:12.799
they just always set everyone as innocent,

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.484
and then they're going to commit many more type two errors.

00:01:16.484 --> 00:01:20.480
Alternatively, if the jury just decided that everyone was guilty,

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.400
then they would never commit a type two error,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.070
but they would commit many more type one errors.

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:29.189
Because of this relationship between type one and type two errors,

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.549
professionals frequently just set

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.954
a threshold for how many type one errors they're willing to commit.

00:01:34.954 --> 00:01:38.135
And then, they try to keep the type two errors

00:01:38.135 --> 00:01:41.465
as low as possible while still meeting this threshold.

00:01:41.465 --> 00:01:45.381
Common type one error rates are one percent from medical field,

00:01:45.381 --> 00:01:49.739
while they're five percent for research journals and other business applications.

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:53.420
But really, this rate should be contingent on your application.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.956
In the next concept,

00:01:54.956 --> 00:01:56.865
you will see one application where

00:01:56.864 --> 00:02:01.069
neither five percent nor a one percent error rate makes very much sense.
