00:00:02.319 --> 00:00:06.240
Now that you've had some practice with setting up hypotheses,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.070
you might be asking yourself,

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.515
why does all this null and alternative stuff really matter?

00:00:10.515 --> 00:00:12.589
Well, it actually matters a lot.

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:15.714
Let's consider again the judicial example from before.

00:00:15.714 --> 00:00:20.550
There are four potential reality decision combos that could be made.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.000
In order to look at each one of these outcomes,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.570
consider this grid where we have the truth of whether or not

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.414
someone is innocent or guilty represented by this axis,

00:00:31.414 --> 00:00:34.409
and then the decision made by the jury

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:38.429
represented as either innocent or guilty on this axis here.

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:41.144
This creates a grid of four potential outcomes.

00:00:41.145 --> 00:00:44.910
In this corner, the truth is that an individual is innocent,

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:48.046
and the jury also believes that individual to be innocent.

00:00:48.046 --> 00:00:49.154
While in this corner,

00:00:49.155 --> 00:00:51.780
the truth is that the individual is guilty,

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.969
and the jury believes them to be guilty.

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.100
In either of these other two,

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.215
the jury has made a mistake as the truth doesn't match the jury decision.

00:01:01.215 --> 00:01:05.814
This provides us with two potential errors that are possible in hypothesis testing.

00:01:05.814 --> 00:01:08.769
The first error that is possible is that the jury might

00:01:08.769 --> 00:01:12.310
consider an individual innocent when they are truly guilty.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.640
This error sets guilty people free.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.959
The second type of error is that the jury considers

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:20.254
an individual guilty when the truth is that they're innocent.

00:01:20.254 --> 00:01:22.199
This error punishes innocent people.
