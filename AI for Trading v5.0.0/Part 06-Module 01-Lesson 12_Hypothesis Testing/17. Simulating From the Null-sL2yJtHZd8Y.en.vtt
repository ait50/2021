00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
Consider the same example as earlier,

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.214
where we asked if the mean height for all coffee drinkers was greater than 70 inches.

00:00:07.214 --> 00:00:11.875
We could again set up a null and alternative hypotheses like these.

00:00:11.875 --> 00:00:14.400
A second approach that is commonly done for making

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.865
decisions in hypothesis testing is the following,

00:00:17.864 --> 00:00:22.829
we assume that the null is true and we know what the sampling distribution would look

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:28.559
like if we were to simulate from the closest value under the null to the alternative.

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:30.809
That is, this value of 70.

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:36.659
That's the closest value under this hypothesis to our alternative hypothesis.

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:41.759
We could use the standard deviation of the sampling distribution to determine what

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:47.199
the sampling distribution would look like if it came from the null hypothesis.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.445
We'll simulate from a normal distribution in this case.

00:00:50.445 --> 00:00:53.460
I'm going to pull over the code that we used before to

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.835
get the standard deviation of our sampling distribution.

00:00:56.835 --> 00:01:02.765
So the standard deviation of our sampling distribution is equal to 0.2658.

00:01:02.765 --> 00:01:05.239
And we know that if it came from

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.534
this null hypothesized value of 70 what it would look like.

00:01:10.534 --> 00:01:12.125
By the central limit theorem,

00:01:12.125 --> 00:01:15.674
we know that it would follow a normal distribution.

00:01:15.674 --> 00:01:18.780
Now, from the NumPy documentation on normal distributions,

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.010
we see we can simulate draws from the normal using the hypothesized mean at

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.844
70 and the standard deviation of our sampling distribution in the following way.

00:01:27.844 --> 00:01:33.810
So here, the loc tells us that the mean of 70 will go in this value,

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.325
and the scale is the standard deviation that we want to use.

00:01:37.325 --> 00:01:40.155
So that's the standard deviation of our sampling distribution.

00:01:40.155 --> 00:01:41.655
And we can simulate, say,

00:01:41.655 --> 00:01:43.765
10,000 values from that.

00:01:43.765 --> 00:01:49.530
Each of the simulated draws here represents a possible mean from the null hypothesis.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.864
We can now ask the question of where the sample mean falls in this distribution.

00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:57.569
If we go back and look at what our sample mean was,

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:01.924
we can see that it falls far below this distribution from the norm.

00:02:01.924 --> 00:02:06.000
If our sample mean were to fall closer to the center value of 70,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.110
it would be a value that we would expect from the null hypothesis and therefore,

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.405
we think the null is more likely to be true.

00:02:12.405 --> 00:02:16.134
In this case, with our sample means so far out in the tail,

00:02:16.134 --> 00:02:21.439
it's far enough that we don't think it probably came from this null hypothesized value.
