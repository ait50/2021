00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
I have attached the data for this example in the Resources tab.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.375
And you also can find it in the works pace on the next concept of our work through.

00:00:07.375 --> 00:00:11.634
This is the same coffee data you saw in the previous lesson on confidence intervals.

00:00:11.634 --> 00:00:14.574
So you might already have it saved on your local as well.

00:00:14.574 --> 00:00:16.739
What if we wanted to ask the question of if

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:20.759
the average height for all coffee drinkers is greater than 70 inches.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.350
We could set up our known alternative hypothesis in the following way.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.609
Here, we have that the average height of

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.129
all coffee drinkers is less than or equal to 70 in the null

00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:31.799
while in this statement we have that

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.829
the average height is greater than 70 in the alternative.

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.574
Notice, we are always testing a parameter.

00:00:37.575 --> 00:00:41.969
So I'm using new here to represent the mean of all coffee drinkers.

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.339
Based on what we just did with confidence intervals,

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.885
you can imagine a very intuitive approach for determining if the null is possible,

00:00:48.884 --> 00:00:54.674
is just to bootstrap a sample set of data and compute the sample mean again and again.

00:00:54.674 --> 00:00:58.919
And build the sampling distribution and corresponding confidence interval to

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.870
determine what are the reasonable values for

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:04.075
the population mean with some level of confidence.

00:01:04.075 --> 00:01:05.990
Let's put this to practice,

00:01:05.989 --> 00:01:08.984
imagine from our dataset we achieve this sample.

00:01:08.984 --> 00:01:12.359
Then we can bootstrap this in the following way.

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:18.560
Now, let's bootstrap a number of times and compute the mean for each bootstrap sample.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.245
Here, we have our bootstrap sample, and here,

00:01:22.245 --> 00:01:24.810
I've created an empty vector of means that we're

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.775
going to append each of our bootstrap means into.

00:01:28.775 --> 00:01:33.105
Now, we have all of our means and we can create our confidence interval.

00:01:33.105 --> 00:01:36.008
Here, I have the lower bound,

00:01:36.007 --> 00:01:37.935
and here is the upper bound.

00:01:37.935 --> 00:01:42.200
Additionally, we might choose to plot those. Here's what it looks like.
