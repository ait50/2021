00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:06.894
When making a decision about whether you're choosing the null or alternative hypothesis,

00:00:06.894 --> 00:00:10.390
you might see certain professionals, specifically statisticians,

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.955
cringe, with concluding remarks like,

00:00:12.955 --> 00:00:14.714
"So based on the data,

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:17.620
we accepted the null hypothesis to be true," or,

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.109
"Based on the data, we accepted the alternative."

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:23.964
Remember, when setting up our null and alternative hypotheses,

00:00:23.964 --> 00:00:28.750
we automatically set the null to be true before any data were collected.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.189
Therefore, this statement is a default.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.019
It isn't like we're uncertain about what hypothesis we'll choose and then we choose one,

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.875
rather, you are by default choosing the null.

00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:43.000
Going back to the judicial example,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.960
everyone is innocent until proven guilty.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.950
You don't choose someone as innocent.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.570
By default, everyone is innocent.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.119
Therefore, in hypothesis testing,

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:53.679
we say, "Based on the data,

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:57.429
we have evidence to reject the null hypothesis," or alternatively,

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:00.894
if we don't have enough evidence to reject the null, we say,

00:01:00.895 --> 00:01:04.719
"Based on the data, we fail to reject the null hypothesis."

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:07.844
Many people will only care about making the right decision.

00:01:07.844 --> 00:01:10.450
So this distinction might seem just a bit picky.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.359
But it stresses that the null is much more likely to be

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:16.170
chosen as you start with the statement being true.
