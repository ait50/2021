00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:11.964
Hey everyone! So, I'm pretty excited about the next sequence of videos that I'm doing.

00:00:11.964 --> 00:00:13.839
They'll be about linear algebra,

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:16.600
which as a lot of you know is one of those subjects that's

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.715
required knowledge for just about any technical discipline,

00:00:19.714 --> 00:00:22.070
but it's also I've noticed generally

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.219
poorly understood by students taking it for the first time.

00:00:25.219 --> 00:00:28.609
A student might go through a class and learn how to compute lots of things like

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.049
matrix multiplication or the determinant or cross products,

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:36.140
which use the determinant or eigenvalues.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.859
But they might come out without really understanding

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:42.204
why matrix multiplication is defined the way that it is.

00:00:42.204 --> 00:00:44.489
Why the cross product has anything to do with

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.065
the determinant or what an eigenvalue really represents.

00:00:48.064 --> 00:00:51.829
Oftentimes, students end up well practiced in the numerical operations of

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.704
matrices but are only vaguely aware of the geometric intuitions underlying it all.

00:00:56.704 --> 00:01:00.000
But there's a fundamental difference between understanding linear algebra

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.450
on a numeric level and understanding it on a geometric level.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.100
Each has its place but roughly speaking,

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:08.409
the geometric understanding is what let's you

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.670
judge what tools to use to solve specific problems,

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.310
feel why they work,

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.340
and know how to interpret the results.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.740
And the numeric understanding is what let's you

00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:20.839
actually carry through the application of those tools.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.659
Now, if you learn linear algebra without getting

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.444
a solid foundation in that geometric understanding,

00:01:26.444 --> 00:01:29.129
the problems can go unnoticed for a while until

00:01:29.129 --> 00:01:31.819
you've gone deeper into whatever field you happen to pursue.

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:36.829
Once you're in a class or a job for that matter that assumes fluency with linear algebra,

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:38.629
the way that your professors or your

00:01:38.629 --> 00:01:42.125
co-workers apply that field could seem like utter magic.

00:01:42.125 --> 00:01:44.569
They'll very quickly know what the right tool to use

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:47.209
is and what the answer roughly looks like in

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:49.679
a way that would seem like computational wizardry if

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.090
you assume that they're actually crunching all the numbers in their head.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.155
Here, as an analogy,

00:01:55.155 --> 00:01:57.920
imagine that when you first learned about the sine function in

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.400
trigonometry you were shown this infinite polynomial.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.250
This by the way is how your calculator evaluates the sine function.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.750
For homework, you might be asked to practice computing approximations of

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.020
the sine function by plugging in various numbers

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.230
to the formula and cutting it off at a reasonable point.

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:16.919
And in fairness, let's say you had a vague idea that

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:19.004
this was supposed to be related to triangles

00:02:19.004 --> 00:02:23.784
but exactly how had never really been clear and was not the focus of the course.

00:02:23.784 --> 00:02:26.289
Later on, if you took a physics course where

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:28.949
sines and cosines are thrown around left and right and

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:31.539
people are able to tell pretty immediately how to apply

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:34.525
them and roughly what the sine of a certain value will be,

00:02:34.525 --> 00:02:37.045
it would be pretty intimidating, wouldn't it?

00:02:37.044 --> 00:02:39.429
It would make it seem like the only people who are cut

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.599
out for physics are those with computers for

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:46.469
brains and you would feel unduly slow or dumb for taking so long on each problem.

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:48.794
It's not that different with linear algebra.

00:02:48.794 --> 00:02:51.014
And luckily, just as with trigonometry,

00:02:51.014 --> 00:02:52.959
there are a handful of intuitions,

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.245
visual intuitions, underlying much of the subject.

00:02:56.245 --> 00:02:57.884
And unlike the trig example,

00:02:57.884 --> 00:03:00.469
the connection between the computation and

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:03.659
these visual intuitions is typically pretty straightforward.

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.960
And when you digest these and really

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.325
understand the relationship between the geometry and the numbers,

00:03:09.324 --> 00:03:11.789
the details of the subject as well as how it's used in

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:14.750
practice start to feel a lot more reasonable.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.129
In fairness, most professors do make an effort to convey that geometric understanding.

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:21.009
The sine example is a little extreme.

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:23.715
But I do think that a lot of courses have students spending

00:03:23.715 --> 00:03:27.300
a disproportionate amount of time on the numerical side of things,

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.150
especially given that in this day and age we almost always get computers

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.569
to handle that half while in practice humans worry about the conceptual half.

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.064
So, this brings me to the upcoming videos.

00:03:38.064 --> 00:03:39.645
The goal is to create a short,

00:03:39.645 --> 00:03:43.240
watchable series animating those intuitions from the basics of

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.530
vectors up through the core topics that make up the essence of linear algebra.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.175
I'll do what I can to keep things well paced throughout

00:03:50.175 --> 00:03:52.770
but it's hard to simultaneously account for

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.790
different people's different backgrounds and levels of comfort so I

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:59.719
do encourage you to readily pause and ponder if you feel that it's necessary.

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:01.650
Actually, I'd give that same advice for

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.010
watching any math video even if it doesn't feel too

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:05.919
quick since the thinking that you do on

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:09.564
your own time is where all the learning really happens, don't you think?

00:04:09.564 --> 00:04:13.439
So with that is an introduction, I'll see you next video.
