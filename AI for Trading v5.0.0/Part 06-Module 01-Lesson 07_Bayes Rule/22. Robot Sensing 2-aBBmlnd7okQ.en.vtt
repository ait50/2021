00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
And the answer is,

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
the prior isn't affected by the measurement,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
so the probability of 0 is at red,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and the probability of 1 at green,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
despite the fact that it's all red.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
To see this, you find the joint of seeing it red and seeing red

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
is 0 times 0.8, that's 0.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
That's the same join for green is

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
1 times 0.2.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So you have to normalize 0 and 0.2.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The sum of those is 0.2.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So let's divide 0 by 0.2, gives us 0,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and 0.2 divided by 0.2 gives us 1.

00:00:37.000 --> 99:59:59.000
These are exactly the numbers over here.
