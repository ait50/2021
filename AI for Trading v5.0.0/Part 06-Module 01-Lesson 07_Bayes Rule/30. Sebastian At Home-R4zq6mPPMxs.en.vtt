00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And I get 0.0217, which is a really small thing.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And the way I get there is what taking home times the probability of rain at home

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
normalizing it using the same number of a year plus the calculation for the same

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
probability of being gone is 0.6 times the rain I've been gone has a probability of 0.3

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and that results is 0.0217 or the better of 2%--did you get this?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
If so, you now understand something that's really interesting.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.120
You're able to look at a hidden variable,

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.700
understand how a test can give you information back

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.570
about this hidden variable and that's really cool

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.000
because it allows you to apply the same scheme

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
to great many practical problems in the world--congratulations!

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
In our next unit, which is optional, I like you to program all of this so you can try the same thing

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
in an actual program interface and writes software that implements things such as Bayes rule.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.364
But not to worry, this is optional.

00:01:09.364 --> 00:01:13.504
If you don't know how to program just skip the next unit.
