Great job finishing this lesson on Bayes rule.

00:00:03.674 --> 00:00:08.324
At this point, you've now gained a ton of valuable knowledge about probability,

00:00:08.324 --> 00:00:11.279
conditional probability and Bayes rule.

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:14.184
To reinforce your understanding of these topics,

00:00:14.185 --> 00:00:16.949
let's go through some probability practice using Python.

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.339
You'll do this in the next lesson.
