00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So once again, we have 0.9, 0.1, and 0.5 over here.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Very quickly multiplying this guy with this girl over here 0.09. This guy with this girl over here 0.45.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Adding them up gives us 0.54, and dividing those correspondingly 0.9 divided by 0.54

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:38.000
gives us 0.166 and so on and 0.833 and so on for dividing 0.45 by 0.54.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And with this means, with the positive test result, our chance of cancer increased from 0.1 to 0.16.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Obviously, our chance of having no cancer decreased accordingly.

00:00:50.000 --> 99:59:59.000
You got this, so let's just summarize.
