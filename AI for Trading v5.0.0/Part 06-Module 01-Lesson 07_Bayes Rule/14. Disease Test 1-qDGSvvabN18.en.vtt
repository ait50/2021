00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Obviously, these are just 1 minus those:

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
0.9, 0.1, and 0.5.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Notice that these two numbers may very well be different.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
There is no contradiction here.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
These guys have to add up to 1, so given Â¬C,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the probability of positive and negative have to add up to 1,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
but these guys don't.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It takes a lot of practice to understand which numbers have to add up to 1.

00:00:23.000 --> 99:59:59.000
But I set it up in a way that you should have gotten it right.
