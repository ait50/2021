Let me now make your life harder.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Suppose our probability of a certain other kind of disease is 0.1,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
so 10% of the population has it.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Our test in the positive case is really informative,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
but there's a 0.5 chance that if I'm cancer-free the test, indeed, says the same thing.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So the sensitivity is high, the specificity is lower.

00:00:26.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And let's start by filling in the first 3 of them.
