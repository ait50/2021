00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
If I now change some parameters--say the robot knows the probability that it's red,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and therefore, the probability 1 is under the green cell as a prior.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Please calculate once again using Bayes rule these posteriors.

00:00:13.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I have to warn you--this is a bit of a tricky case.
