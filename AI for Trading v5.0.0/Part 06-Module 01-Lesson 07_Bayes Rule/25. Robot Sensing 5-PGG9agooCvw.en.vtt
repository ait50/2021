00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, the answer is you multiply our prior of 1/3

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
with the probability of seeing red in Cell B,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
as seeing green at 0.9 probability,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
so red is 0.1.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So 0.1 times this guy over here

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.235
gives 0.033.
