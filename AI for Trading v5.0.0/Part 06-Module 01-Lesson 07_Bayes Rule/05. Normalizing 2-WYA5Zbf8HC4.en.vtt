00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And now finally, we come up with the actual posterior,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
whereas this one over here is often called the joint probability of two events.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And the posterior is obtained by dividing this guy over here with this normalizer.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So let's do this over here--let's divide this guy over here by this normalizer to get

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
my percent distribution of having cancer given that I received the positive test result.

00:00:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So divide this number by this.
