00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.770
I will now make your life really hard.

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.000
Suppose there are 3 places in the world, not just 2.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
There are a red one and 2 green ones.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And for simplicity, we'll call them A, B, and C.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Let's assume that all of them

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
have the same prior probability of 1/3 or 0.333, so on.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Let's say the robot sees red,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and as before, the probability of seeing red

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.280
in Cell A is 0.9.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.980
The probability of seeing green in Cell B

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.000
0.9.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Probability of seeing green in Cell C

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
is also 0.9.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So what I've changed is,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I've given the hidden variable,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
kind of like the cancer/non cancer variable,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
3 states.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
There's not just 2 as before, A or B.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
It's now A, B, or C.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Let's solve this problem together,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
because it follows exactly the same recipe as before,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
even though it might not be obvious.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So let me ask you,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
what is the joint of being in Cell A

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
after having seen the red color?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.425
This is the joint as before.
