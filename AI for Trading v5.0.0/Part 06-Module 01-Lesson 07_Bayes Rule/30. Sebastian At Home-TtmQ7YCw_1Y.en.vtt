00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This test is actually directly taken from my life and you'll smile when you see my problem.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I used to travel a lot. It was so bad for a while.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I would find myself in a bed not knowing what country I'm in. I kid you not.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So let's say, I'm gone 60% of my time and I'm at home only 40% of my time.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Now at summer, I live in California and it truly doesn't rain in the summer.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Whereas in many of the countries I have traveled to, there's a much higher chance of rain.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So let's now say, I lie in my bed, here I am lying in bed, and I wake up

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and I open the window and I see it's raining.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Let's now apply Bayes rule--What do you think is the probability I'm home

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.897
now that I see it's raining--just give me this one number.
