00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, we really said that we had a situation where

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
the prior P(C), a test with a certain sensitivity (Pos/C), and a certain specificity (Neg/₇C).

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
When you receive, say, a positive test result, what you do is,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
you take your prior P(C) you multiply in the probability of this test result, given C,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and you multiply in the probability of the test result given (Neg/₇C).

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So, this is your branch for the consideration that you have cancer.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
This is your branch for the consideration of no cancer.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
When you're done with this, you arrive at a number

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
that now combines the cancer hypothesis with the test result.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Look for the cancer hypothesis and the no cancer hypothesis.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Now, what you do, you add those up and then normally don't add up to one.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
You get a certain quantity which happens to be the total probability

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that the test is what it was in this case positive.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And all you do next is divide or normalize this thing over here by

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
the sum over here and the same on the right side.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The divider is the same for both cases because this is your cancer branch, your non-cancer branch,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
but this score does not depend on the cancer variable anymore.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
What you now get out is the desired posterior probability,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and those add up to 1 if you did everything correct, as shown over here.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
This is the algorithm for Bayes Rule.
