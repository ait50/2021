00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.639
Bayes rule is extremely important in robotics and it can be described in one sentence.

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:07.274
Given an initial prediction,

00:00:07.275 --> 00:00:09.449
if we gather additional related data,

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:11.669
data that our initial prediction depends on,

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:13.710
we can improve that prediction.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.760
For example, let's say our initial prediction also known as a prior belief,

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.655
is an estimate of a car's location on a road.

00:00:20.655 --> 00:00:24.730
This might be the location given by a slightly inaccurate GPS signal.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.670
Then, we use sensors to gather data

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.490
about the car's surroundings and how the car is moving.

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.420
How do you think this sensor data can help us improve our initial location prediction?
