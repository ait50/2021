00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now, I should say if we got this, you don't find any immediate

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
significant about statistics and probability.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is totally nontrivial, but it comes in very handy.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So, I'm going to practice this with you using a second example. In this case, you are a robot.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This robot lives in a world of exactly two places. There is a red place and a green place, R and G.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now, I say initially, this robot has no clue where it is,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
so the prior probability for either place, red or green, is 0.5.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It also has a sensor as it can see through its eyes, but his sensor seems to be somewhat unreliable.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So, the probability of seeing red at the red grid cell is 0.8,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and the probability of seeing green at the green cell is also 0.8.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Now, I suppose the robot sees red.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:07.000
What are now the posterior probabilities that the robot is at the red cell given that it just saw red

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and conversely what's the probability that it's at the green cell even though it saw red.

00:01:14.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Now, you can apply Bayes Rule and figure that out.
