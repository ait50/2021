00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now the answer is about 0.615

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
or 0.385.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
These are approximate.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Once again, 0.5 times 0.8 is 0.4.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
0.5 minus this guy is again 0.5.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
0.25, add those up,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
0.65,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
normalizing 0.4 divided by 0.65

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
gives approximately 0.615.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
0.25 divided by 0.65 is approximately 0.385,

00:00:37.000 --> 99:59:59.000
so now you you've got it.
