00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So this unit is a tough one.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We're going to talk about perhaps the holy grail

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
of probabilistic inference.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It's called Bayes Rule.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Bayes Rule is based on Reverend Thomas Bayes,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
who used this principle to infer the existence of God,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
but in doing so, he created a new family

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
of methods that has vastly influenced artificial intelligence

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and statistics.

00:00:25.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So let's dive in!
