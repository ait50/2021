00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And the answer is exactly the same as this over here,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
because the prior is the same for B and C,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and those probabilities are the same for B and C,

00:00:10.000 --> 99:59:59.000
so they should be exactly the same.
