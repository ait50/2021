00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Obviously, P(C) is 0.01  (times) 0.9 is 0.009, whereas 0.99  (times) 0.1, this guy over here, is 0.099.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
What we've computed is here is the absolute area in here which is

00:00:21.000 --> 99:59:59.999
0.009 and the absolute area in here which is 0.099.
