In this example, it gives us funny numbers. It was 3 for red as 0.8 and one for the green as 0.2.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And it's all to do with the fact that in the beginning where there had no clue where it is.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The joint for red after seeing red is 0.4. The same for green is 0.1. 0.4+0.1, S to 0.5.

00:00:25.000 --> 99:59:59.000
If you normalized 0.4 divided by 0.5, you get 0.8, and if you normalized 0.1 by 0.5, you get 0.2.
