00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In Bayes rule, we have a hidden variable we care about--whether they have cancer or not.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
But we can't measure it directly and instead we have a test.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We have a prior of how frequent this variable is true and the test is generally characterized

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
by how often it says positive when the variable is true

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and how often it is negative and the variable is false.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Bayes rule takes a prior, multiplies in the measurement,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
which in this case we assume to be the positive measurement to give us a new variable

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and does the same for all actual measurement, given the opposite assumption about

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
our hidden variable of cancer and that multiplication gives us this guy over here.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We add those two things up and then it gives us a new variable and then

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.000
we divide these guys to arrive the best estimate of the hidden variable c given our test result.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And this example, I used the positive example is a test result

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
but it might do the same with a negative example.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
This was exactly the same as in our diagram in the beginning.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
There was a prior of our case, we have this specific variable to be true.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.000
We noticed inside this prior, it can cover the region for which our test result applies.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We noticed that test result also apply when the condition is not fulfilled.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So, this expression over here and this expression over here corresponds exactly

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
to the red area over here and the green area over here.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
But then we noticed that these two areas don't add up to 1.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
The reason is that's lots of stuff outside, so we calculated the total area

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
which was this expression over here, pPos.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And then we normalized these two things over here by the total area to get the relative area

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
that is assigned the red thing versus the green thing and at this time by just dividing by the total area

00:01:56.000 --> 99:59:59.000
in this region over here; thereby, getting rid of any of the other cases.
