00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The number here is 0.001 and it's the product of my prior for cancer which is 0.01,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and the probability of getting a negative result in the case of cancer which is right over here, 0.1.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
If I multiply these two things together, I get 0.001. The probability here is 0.891.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And when I'm multiplying is the prior probability of not having cancer which is 0.99

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
with the probability of seeing a negative result in the case of not having cancer,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and that is the one right over here, 0.9.

00:00:39.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So, we'll multiply 0.99 with 0.9, I actually get 0.891.
