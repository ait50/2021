00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This is approximately 0.0011, which we get by dividing 0.001 by the normalizer 0.892,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and the posterior probability of being cancer-free after the test

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:25.000
is approximately 0.9989, and that's obtained by dividing this probability over here by the normalizer

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and not surprisingly, these two values indeed add up to 1.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Now, what's remarkable about this outcome is really what it means.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Before the test, we had a 1% chance of having cancer,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
now, we have about a 0.9% chance of having cancer.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So, a cancer probability went down by about a factor of 9.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So, the test really helped us gaining confidence that we are cancer-free.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Conversely, before we had a 99% chance of being cancer free, now it's 99.89%.

00:00:58.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So, all the numbers are working exactly how we expect them to work.
