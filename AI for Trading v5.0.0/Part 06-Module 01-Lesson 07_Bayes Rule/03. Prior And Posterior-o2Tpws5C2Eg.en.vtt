00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So this is the essence of Bayes Rule,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
which I'll give to you to you in a second.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
There's some sort of a prior, of which we mean

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
the probability before you run a test,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and then you get some evidence from the test itself.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and that all leads you to what's called a posterior probability.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Now this is not really a plus operation.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
In fact, in reality,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
it's more like a multiplication,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but semantically, what Bayes Rule does is

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
it incorporates some evidence from

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
the test into your prior probability

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
to arrive at a posterior probability.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So let's make this specific.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
In our cancer example, we know that the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
prior probability of cancer is 0.01,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
which is the same as 1%.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The posterior of the probability of cancer given

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
that our test is positive,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
abbreviate here as positive,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
is the product of the prior

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
times our test sensitivity, which is

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
what is the chance of a positive result

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
given that I have cancer?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And you might remember,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
this was 0.9, or 90%.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Now just to warn you, this isn't quite correct.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
To make this correct, we also have to compute

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
the posterior for the non cancer option,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
which there is no cancer given a positive test.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And using the prior, we know that P of not C is 0.99.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
It's minus P of C

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Times the probability of getting a positive test result

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
given not C.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Realize these 2 equations are the same,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
but I exchanged C for not C.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And this one over here takes a moment to computer.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
We know that our test gives us a negative result

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
if it's cancer free, 0.9 chance

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
As a result, it gives us a positive result

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
in the cancer free case, with 10% chance.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Now what's interesting is this is about the correct equation

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
except the probabilities don't add up to 1.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
To see I'm going to ask you to compute those,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
so please give me the exact numbers

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
for the first expression

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and the second expression written over here

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
using our example up there.
