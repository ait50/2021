00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
Let's talk a bit more about why uncertainty is so

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.009
important in the field of robotics and self-driving cars.

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:08.632
We know that measurements like the speed, the direction,

00:00:08.632 --> 00:00:13.324
and the location of a car are challenging to measure and we can't measure them perfectly.

00:00:13.324 --> 00:00:16.074
There's some uncertainty in each of these measurements.

00:00:16.074 --> 00:00:19.480
We also know that many of these measurements affect one another.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.830
For example, if we are uncertain about the location of a car,

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:25.409
we can reduce that uncertainty by collecting data

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.054
about the car's surroundings and its movement.

00:00:28.053 --> 00:00:31.754
Self-driving cars measure all of these things from a car's speed,

00:00:31.754 --> 00:00:35.129
to the scenery and objects that surround it, with sensors.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.380
And though these sensor measurements aren't perfect,

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.885
when the information they provide is combined

00:00:39.884 --> 00:00:43.049
using conditional probability and something called Bayes rule,

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:46.349
they can form a reliable representation of a car's position,

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.590
its movement and its environment.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.050
Let's take a look at Bayes Rule.
