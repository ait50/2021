00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now, the same algorithm works if your test says negative.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We'll practice this in just 1 second. Suppose your test result says negative.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
You could still ask the same question:

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Now, what's my probability having cancer or not? But now all the positives in here become negatives.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The sum is the total probability of negative test results,  and we may now divide by this score,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
you now get the posterior probability for cancer and non-cancer assuming you had a

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
negative test result, which of course to be much, much more favorable

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
for you because none of us wants to have cancer.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So, look at this for a while and let's now do the calculation for the negative case

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
using the same numbers I gave you before,

00:00:46.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and with the step by step this time around so it can really guide you through the process.
