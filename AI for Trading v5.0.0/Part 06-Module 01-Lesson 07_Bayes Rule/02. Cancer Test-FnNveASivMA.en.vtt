00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And I would argue it's about 8%.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In fact, as we see, it will come out at 8 1/3%

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
mathematically.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And the way to see this in this diagram is

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
this is the region that should test as positive.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
By having a positive test, you know you're in this region,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and nothing else matters.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You know you're in this circle.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
But within this circle, the ratio of the

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
cancerous region relative to

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
the entire region is still pretty small.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It increase, obviously, having a positive test

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
changes your cancer probability,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
but it only increases by a factor of about 8,

00:00:38.000 --> 99:59:59.000
as we will see in a second.
