00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So what have you learned?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In Bayes Rule, there will be more than just 2

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
underlying causes of cancer/non cancer.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
There might be 3, 4, or 5, any number.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We can apply exactly the same math,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
but we have to keep track of more values.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
In fact, the robot might also have more than

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
just 2 test outcomes.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Here was red or green, but it could be red, green, or blue.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And this means that our measurement probability will be more elaborate.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I have to give you more information,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
but the math remains exactly the same.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We can now deal with very large problems

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
that have many possible hidden causes

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
of where the world might be,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and we can still apply Bayes Rule to find all of these numbers.

00:00:42.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Let me give you one final test.
