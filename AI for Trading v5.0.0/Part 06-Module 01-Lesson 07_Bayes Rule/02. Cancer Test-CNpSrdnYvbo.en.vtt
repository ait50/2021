00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's use the cancer example from my last unit.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
There's a specific cancer that occurs in 1% of the population,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and a test for this cancer and with 90% chance

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
it is positive if they have this cancer, C.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
That's usually called the sensitivity.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
But the test sometimes is positive,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
even if you don't have C.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Let's say with another 90% chance

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
it's negative if we don't have C.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000
That's usually called the specificity.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So here's my question.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Without further symptoms, you take the test,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and the test comes back positive.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
What do you think is the probability of having

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
that specific type of cancer?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
To answer this, let's draw a diagram.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Suppose these are all of the people,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and some of them, exactly 1%, have cancer.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
99% is cancer free.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
We know there's a test

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
that if you have cancer,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
correctly diagnose it with 90% chance.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So if we draw the area where the test is positive,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
cancer and test positive,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
then this area over here

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
is 90% of the cancer circle.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
However, this isn't the full truth.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The test sent out as positive

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
even if the person doesn't have cancer.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
In fact, in our case,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
it happened to be in 10% of all cases.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
So we have to add more area,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
because as big as 10% of this large area

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
is as big as 10% of this large area

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
where the test might go positive,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
but the person doesn't have cancer.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So this blue area is 10% of all the area over here

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
minus the little small cancer circle.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And clearly, all the area outside these circles

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
corresponds a situation of no cancer,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and the test is negative.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
So let me ask you again.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Suppose we have a positive test,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
what do you think?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Would a prior probability of cancer

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
of 1%,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
a sensitivity and specificity of 90%,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Do you think your new chances are now

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
90%

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
or 8%

00:02:34.000 --> 99:59:59.000
or still just 1%?
