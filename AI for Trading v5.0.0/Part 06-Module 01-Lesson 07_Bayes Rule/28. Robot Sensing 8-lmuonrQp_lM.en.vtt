00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
As usual, we divide this guy over here

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.430
by the normalizer,

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.000
which gives us 0.818.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.850
Realize all these numbers are a little bit approximate here.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.000
Same for this guy, it's approximately 0.091.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And this is completely symmetrical, 0.091.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.646
And surprise, these guys all add up to 1.
