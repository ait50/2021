00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We begin with our prior probability, our sensitivity and our specifitivity,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and I want you to begin by filling in all the missing values.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So, there's the probability of no cancer, probability of negative, which is negation of positive,

00:00:15.000 --> 99:59:59.000
given C, and probability of negative-positive given not C.
