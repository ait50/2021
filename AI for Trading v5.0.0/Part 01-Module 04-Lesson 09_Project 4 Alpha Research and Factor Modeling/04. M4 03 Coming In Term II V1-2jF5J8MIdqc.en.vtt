00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Hi there. Congratulations again on completing

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.935
term one of the AI for Trading nanodegree program.

00:00:05.934 --> 00:00:09.949
You've built a solid foundation in quant research over these last few months.

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:14.579
In term two, you'll build upon this foundation with an emphasis

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.454
on advanced techniques using natural language processing and deep neural nets.

00:00:19.454 --> 00:00:24.674
You'll use these AI methods to process alternative data and generate trading signals.

00:00:24.675 --> 00:00:27.330
After, you'll learn and practice back testing,

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.389
which is a crucial step in research and which is

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.755
not often taught in academic or online courses.

00:00:33.755 --> 00:00:38.240
Gaining concrete experience in Thoreau backtesting is what will enable you to

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.320
find actionable signals and differentiate the real signals from the noise.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.634
Finally, you'll also learn

00:00:45.634 --> 00:00:50.164
advanced techniques for Alpha combination using machine learning.

00:00:50.164 --> 00:00:54.329
Alpha combination is also a key step in the quant workflow,

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.019
as real-world portfolios, use a combination of signals from multiple Alphas.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.680
Deciding not only which Alphas to include but how to combine

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:07.795
them is a key skill set to have as a quant researcher.

00:01:07.795 --> 00:01:12.320
We're really excited about what's coming up in term two and I hope you are too.
