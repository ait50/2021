00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.749
Now that you've learned a lot of the theory behind alpha and risk factors,

00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:07.464
and had a chance to work through some of the important ideas and exercises,

00:00:07.464 --> 00:00:10.080
you have the opportunity to put all these ideas into

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.625
practice in your final project of term one.

00:00:13.625 --> 00:00:19.125
Personally, it's my favorite project of the term in part, because I designed it.

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:22.765
In this project, we code up and test several alpha factors.

00:00:22.765 --> 00:00:26.179
First, we evaluate the factors to see which ones may be

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:29.989
promising candidates to put together into a combined alpha factor.

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:32.914
We examine them initially to check whether the alphas

00:00:32.914 --> 00:00:35.905
have predictive power in the cross-section of stocks.

00:00:35.905 --> 00:00:37.865
We calculate their Sharpe ratios,

00:00:37.865 --> 00:00:42.670
and we tried to get a sense of how much trading they would incur by a turnover analysis.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.250
Then we throw the alphas into an optimizer in order

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.549
to calculate optimal portfolio weights by

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:53.029
maximizing our predicted return via our alphas and

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.545
simultaneously attempting to neutralize exposure to common risk factors,

00:00:57.545 --> 00:01:00.810
which are sources of return variance.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.875
I created this project as a fully production-ready prototype,

00:01:04.875 --> 00:01:08.734
so that you could see how industry practitioners do this in the real world.

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:11.659
It was especially important to me that you see

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.509
how ideas for alphas turned into code and how

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.700
both alpha and risk factor models played

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.025
distinct and equally important roles in portfolio construction.

00:01:21.025 --> 00:01:24.410
I also utilized industry-ready Python libraries

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.310
that make common operations simpler and faster,

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.170
so you have a chance to get familiar with these packages.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.890
I'm really excited to share this methodology with you,

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.120
and I hope you enjoy the project.
