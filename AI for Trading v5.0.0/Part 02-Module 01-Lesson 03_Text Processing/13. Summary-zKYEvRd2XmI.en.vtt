00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.665
We have covered a number of text processing steps.

00:00:03.665 --> 00:00:07.275
Let's summarize what a typical workflow looks like.

00:00:07.275 --> 00:00:10.134
Starting with a plain text sentence,

00:00:10.134 --> 00:00:15.039
you first normalize it by converting to lowercase and removing punctuation,

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:19.559
and then you split it up into words using a tokenizer.

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:24.714
Next, you can remove stop words to reduce the vocabulary you have to deal with.

00:00:24.714 --> 00:00:26.519
Depending on your application,

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.550
you may then choose to apply a combination of stemming and

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.134
lemmatization to reduce words to the root or stem form.

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:35.655
It is common to apply both,

00:00:35.655 --> 00:00:38.365
lemmatization first, and then stemming.

00:00:38.365 --> 00:00:42.210
This procedure converts a natural language sentence into

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.000
a sequence of normalized tokens which you can use for further analysis.
