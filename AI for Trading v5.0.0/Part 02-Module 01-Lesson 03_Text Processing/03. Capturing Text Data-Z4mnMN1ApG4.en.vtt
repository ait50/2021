00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.690
The processing stage begins with reading text data.

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.355
Depending on your application,

00:00:05.355 --> 00:00:07.890
that can be from one of several sources.

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:12.449
The simplest source is a plain text file on your local machine.

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:17.684
We can read it in using Python's built in file input mechanism.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:23.439
Text data may also be included as part of a larger database or table.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.349
Here, we have a CSV file containing information about some news articles.

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.740
We can read this in using pandas very easily.

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.649
Pandas includes several useful string manipulation methods

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:38.984
that can be applied to an entire column at once.

00:00:38.984 --> 00:00:43.424
For instance, converting all values to lowercase.

00:00:43.424 --> 00:00:47.304
Sometimes, you may have to fetch data from an online resource,

00:00:47.304 --> 00:00:50.210
such as a web service or API.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.140
In this example, we use the requests library in

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.204
Python to obtain a quote of the day from a simple API,

00:00:57.204 --> 00:00:59.229
but you could also obtain tweets,

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:02.684
reviews, comments, whatever you would like to analyze.

00:01:02.685 --> 00:01:05.995
Most APIs return JSON or XML data,

00:01:05.995 --> 00:01:11.280
so you need to be aware of the structure in order to pull out the fields that you need.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.230
Many data sets you will encounter have likely been

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.000
fetched and prepared by someone else using a similar procedure.
