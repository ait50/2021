00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
Named entities are typically noun phrases that

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.044
refer to some specific object, person, or place.

00:00:07.044 --> 00:00:13.609
You can use the ne_chunk function to label named entities in text.

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:18.125
Note that you have to first tokenize and tag parts of speech.

00:00:18.125 --> 00:00:20.010
This is a very simple example,

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.295
but notice how the different entity types are also recognized: person,

00:00:25.295 --> 00:00:30.830
organization, and GPE, which stands for geopolitical entity.

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:33.469
Also note how it identified the two words,

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.024
Udacity and Inc, together as a single entity.

00:00:37.024 --> 00:00:40.159
Out in the wild, performance is not always

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:44.139
great but training on a large corpus definitely helps.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.649
Named entity recognition is often used to index and search for news articles,

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.250
for example, on companies of interest.
