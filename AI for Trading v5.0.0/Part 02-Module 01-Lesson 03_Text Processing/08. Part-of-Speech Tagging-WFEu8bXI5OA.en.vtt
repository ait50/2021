00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.649
Remember parts of speech from school?

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:06.910
Nouns, pronouns, verbs, adverbs, et cetera.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.269
Identifying how words are being used in

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.134
a sentence can help us better understand what is being said.

00:00:13.134 --> 00:00:18.280
It can also point out relationships between words and recognize cross references.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.395
NLTK, again, makes things pretty easy for us.

00:00:22.394 --> 00:00:26.324
You can pass in tokens or words to the POS tag function

00:00:26.324 --> 00:00:31.524
which returns a tag for each word identifying different parts of speech.

00:00:31.524 --> 00:00:36.344
Notice how it has correctly labelled the first utterance of "lie" as a verb,

00:00:36.344 --> 00:00:39.394
while marking the second one as a noun.

00:00:39.395 --> 00:00:45.155
Refer to the NLTK documentation for more details on what each tag means.

00:00:45.155 --> 00:00:50.304
One of the cool applications of part of speech tagging is parsing sentences.

00:00:50.304 --> 00:00:53.655
Here's an example from the NLTK book that uses

00:00:53.655 --> 00:00:58.049
a custom grammar to parse an ambiguous sentence.

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:02.819
Notice how the parser returns both interpretations that are valid.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.609
It is much easier to see the difference when we visualize the parse trees.

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:11.810
I shot an elephant in my pajamas,

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.969
versus, I shot an elephant and the elephant was in my pajamas.

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:22.200
How he got into my pajamas? I don't know.
