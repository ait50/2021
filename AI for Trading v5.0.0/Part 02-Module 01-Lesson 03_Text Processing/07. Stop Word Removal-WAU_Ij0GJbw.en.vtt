00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
Stop words are uninformative words like, is, our,

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.300
the, in, at, et cetera that do not add a lot of meaning to a sentence.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.890
They are typically very commonly occurring words,

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.630
and we may want to remove them to reduce the vocabulary we have to

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.130
deal with and hence the complexity of later procedures.

00:00:20.129 --> 00:00:24.254
Notice that even without our and the in the sentence above,

00:00:24.254 --> 00:00:28.414
we can still infer it's positive sentiment toward dogs.

00:00:28.414 --> 00:00:34.740
You can see for yourself which words NLTK considers to be stop words in English.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.554
Note that this is based on a specific corpus or collection of text.

00:00:39.554 --> 00:00:42.875
Different corpora may have different stop words.

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:46.725
Also, a word maybe a stop word in one application,

00:00:46.725 --> 00:00:48.914
but a useful word in another.

00:00:48.914 --> 00:00:51.719
To remove stop words from a piece of text,

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.839
you can use a Python list comprehension with a filtering condition.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.359
Here, we apply stop word removal to the movie review after normalizing and tokenizing it.

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.635
The result is a little hard to read,

00:01:04.635 --> 00:01:07.800
but notice how it has helped reduce the size of the input,

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.159
at the same time important words have been retained.
