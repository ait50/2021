00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
In this lesson, you'll learn how to read text data from

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.330
different sources and prepare it for feature extraction.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.169
You'll begin by cleaning it to remove irrelevant items,

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:11.869
such as HTML tags.

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:15.584
You will then normalize text by converting it into all lowercase,

00:00:15.585 --> 00:00:18.750
removing punctuations and extra spaces.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.954
Next, you will split the text into words or tokens and remove words that are too common,

00:00:23.954 --> 00:00:25.920
also known as stop words.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.355
Finally, you will learn how to identify different parts of speech,

00:00:29.355 --> 00:00:35.424
named entities, and convert words into canonical forms using stemming and lemmatization.

00:00:35.424 --> 00:00:37.784
After going through all these processing steps,

00:00:37.784 --> 00:00:39.944
your text may look very different,

00:00:39.945 --> 00:00:42.600
but it captures the essence of what was being

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.450
conveyed in a form that is easier to work with.
