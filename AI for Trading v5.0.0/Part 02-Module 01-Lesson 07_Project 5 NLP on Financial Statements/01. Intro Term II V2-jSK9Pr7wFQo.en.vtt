00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
Up until now, we've learned some basic concepts in

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.580
natural language processing including bag-of-words,

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.294
stop words, stemming, lemmatization,

00:00:08.294 --> 00:00:12.990
and term frequency inverse document frequency or TFIDF.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.820
In our coding exercise,

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.070
we've implemented these algorithms using Python.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.890
We've also learned about financial statement data collected by

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.149
the US Securities and Exchange Commission and how to access them on the Internet.

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:27.449
These concepts can be used to systematically interpret

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.750
textual financial data to create stock selection models.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.164
Good fundamental analysts investigate

00:00:33.164 --> 00:00:36.000
all relevant information regarding the stocks they follow.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.435
This includes financial statements required by the regulatory authorities

00:00:39.435 --> 00:00:44.105
like 10-Ks which are published annually and 10-Qs which are published quarterly.

00:00:44.104 --> 00:00:48.484
This is a lot of work for the analyst who covers approximately 30 to 40 stocks.

00:00:48.484 --> 00:00:53.119
Using NLP techniques, a quantitative analyst can quickly analyze sections

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:58.339
from all 10-Ks and 10-Qs for all the companies required to file with the SCC.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.825
That's approximately 3,000 to 4,000 companies every quarter.

00:01:02.825 --> 00:01:07.085
In this project, we're going to access the SCC website to download

00:01:07.084 --> 00:01:11.299
annual 10-K filings and extract key sections for NLP analysis.

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.879
We'll use several Python libraries to implement

00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:17.375
the analysis and create a text-based stock selection model.

00:01:17.375 --> 00:01:20.329
This stock selection model was originally described

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:23.185
in an academic paper called Lazy Prices,

00:01:23.185 --> 00:01:25.034
authored by Lauren Cohen,

00:01:25.034 --> 00:01:28.289
Christopher Malloy, and Quoc Nguyen.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.010
Their research investigates how changes in

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.225
particular sections of the financial statements can be used for picking stocks.

00:01:35.224 --> 00:01:38.629
These concepts we'll learn in this project are important in

00:01:38.629 --> 00:01:40.189
many textual data modeling

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.340
techniques that are employed by quantitative investment managers.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.740
From analyzing financial documents to processing news articles and social media posts,

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:54.125
these basic NLP concepts form part of the core toolkits for quantitative managers.

00:01:54.125 --> 00:01:56.644
I'm really excited to share this methodology with you,

00:01:56.644 --> 00:01:58.339
and I hope you enjoy the project.
