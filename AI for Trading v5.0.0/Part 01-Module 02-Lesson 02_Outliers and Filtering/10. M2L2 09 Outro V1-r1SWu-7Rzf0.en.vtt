00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480
In this lesson, we've discussed common sources of outliers and data,

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.235
some ways to spot them,

00:00:06.235 --> 00:00:08.765
and a few things you can do to handle them.

00:00:08.765 --> 00:00:12.525
However, it's worth noting that your strategy for dealing

00:00:12.525 --> 00:00:16.280
with outliers will probably vary on a case-by-case basis.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:22.160
In general, pay attention to your dataset and investigate when you see something unusual.
