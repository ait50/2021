00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.154
What are we talking about when we talk about outliers?

00:00:03.154 --> 00:00:06.269
We're talking about extreme or unexpected values in

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:10.109
market data which may or may not represent real events.

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:14.399
For example, if we're tracking a solar energy company stock price,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.984
we might see unexpected movements in the price on a day when a solar eclipse occurs.

00:00:18.984 --> 00:00:20.460
Outliers can show up for

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.464
a million different reasons but some reasons are more common than others.

00:00:24.464 --> 00:00:29.195
In this video, we're going to talk about a few of the most common types of outliers.

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:32.255
Outliers can always appear due to human error,

00:00:32.255 --> 00:00:36.304
either during manual data entry or in the form of computer bugs.

00:00:36.304 --> 00:00:38.769
These are known as fat finger errors.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.540
To cite a few examples that had newsworthy consequences,

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:47.869
in 2001 a Japanese traitor cost his employer UBS Warburg,

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:52.149
71 million pounds when he sold 610,000 shares at

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.869
60 yen instead of six shares at 610,000 yen as he had intended.

00:00:57.869 --> 00:01:00.739
In 2015, a junior member of

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.655
Deutsche Bank's foreign exchange sales team processed a trade using

00:01:04.655 --> 00:01:07.760
a gross figure rather than a net figure causing

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.560
a payment to a U.S. hedge fund of six billion dollars,

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.430
orders of magnitude too high.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.944
Sometimes data can be missing completely,

00:01:15.944 --> 00:01:19.210
entered as zeros or duplicated from previous states.

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:24.739
This can happen due to lax quality control of market data vendors but sometimes exchanges

00:01:24.739 --> 00:01:26.759
themselves can be missing data.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.930
Data maybe missing because the stock was suspended from

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.110
trading for a day or more often, for part of a day.

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:36.890
Trading on a stock can be stopped for regulatory reasons,

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.760
to reduce volatile trading prior to a companies news announcement

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.719
or when there's uncertainty about whether the stock continues to meet listing standards.

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:49.004
It can also be stopped for non-regulatory reasons.

00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:54.004
For example, if there's a significant imbalance and pending buy and sell orders.

00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:56.959
In these cases, one way to check if trading actually

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:00.204
occurred is to check if the trade volume was zero.

00:02:00.204 --> 00:02:03.605
Trading for an entire exchange can also be stopped.

00:02:03.605 --> 00:02:06.715
There are mechanisms called trading curves or circuit

00:02:06.715 --> 00:02:10.895
breakers that halt trading if an index drops by a certain percent.

00:02:10.895 --> 00:02:14.260
The idea is to prevent stock market crashes,

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:16.774
events when the prices of stocks across

00:02:16.775 --> 00:02:21.460
a significant cross section of the market drops suddenly and significantly.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.445
You might also see extreme price movements that are due to real events such as earnings,

00:02:26.444 --> 00:02:28.715
mergers or other announcements.

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:33.409
Announcements represent information that the market previously did not know.

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:36.694
So these can surprise the general market if the results are much

00:02:36.694 --> 00:02:40.840
better or worse than the market expected, so to speak.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.314
When the market adjusts to this information,

00:02:43.314 --> 00:02:44.930
the stock price fluctuates as

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.469
the new information starts to be reflected in the trading price.

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:51.900
For example, the athletic apparel company, Puma,

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.430
made an unexpected earnings announcement on October 18th,

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.430
2017 in which it reported stronger than expected third-quarter earnings.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.620
That day, its stock closed four percent higher than

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.259
the previous day's close and the subsequent days

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:09.454
saw fluctuations as the price rose still further.

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:11.210
Outliers can occur due to

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.945
the intended or unintended actions of computer trading programs.

00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:18.185
For example, in 2010 the market experienced

00:03:18.185 --> 00:03:23.900
a flash crash which lasted only 36 minutes and was later linked to trading algorithms.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.129
While extreme price fluctuations occurred during this short period,

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:29.854
they were due to real events.

00:03:29.854 --> 00:03:32.134
Sometimes quants must work with

00:03:32.134 --> 00:03:34.564
unadjusted or nominal price data

00:03:34.564 --> 00:03:38.599
because adjusted price data are unavailable through their data source,

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:43.259
when working with real time data directly from a stock exchange for example.

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:45.949
If you are working with unadjusted price data,

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:51.349
you will see discontinuities in prices on dates when companies issue dividends,

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:54.858
split their stock or took other corporate actions.

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:58.308
Companies may issue dividends on a regular schedule

00:03:58.308 --> 00:04:02.439
or may decide to issue one-off so-called special dividends.

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:05.810
In this example, you can see that in 2017,

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.900
Costco issued several regular dividends as

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.590
well as a large seven dollar per share special dividend.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.829
These discontinuities can look like outliers if returns are calculated on these data.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.680
A stock trades ex-dividend on or after the ex-dividend date,

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.324
so on this date, non-adjusted prices decrease.

00:04:26.324 --> 00:04:29.779
This represents the fact that the net company value has

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:34.519
decreased because cash has been transferred from the company to shareholders.

00:04:34.519 --> 00:04:37.789
However, after prices are adjusted,

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.379
change demand for company stock may also cause prices to change.

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:46.800
Price changes due to change demand are real market effects.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.030
To deal with discontinuities in unadjusted prices,

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:52.669
whoever is cleaning the data must go back,

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.939
look at corporate events and cumulatively adjust

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:59.670
for each dividend distribution to generate adjusted prices.
