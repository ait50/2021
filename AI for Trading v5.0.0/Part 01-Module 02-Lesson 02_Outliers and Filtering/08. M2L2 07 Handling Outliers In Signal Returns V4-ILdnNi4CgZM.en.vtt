00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
After you've identified anomalous skew in

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.904
your signal returns and you think you know the cause, what do you do?

00:00:06.905 --> 00:00:09.810
The best strategy for dealing with these types of

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.525
outliers varies on a case-by-case basis.

00:00:12.525 --> 00:00:16.140
If you know it's just bad data from the data vendor,

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.060
you can try to fix it by replacing

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:21.614
the affected data with correct values from a different vendor.

00:00:21.614 --> 00:00:23.099
If you can't do this,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.340
you might try to determine if your research result will be greatly

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:30.134
affected if you replace the value with any reasonable value.

00:00:30.135 --> 00:00:33.425
For example, the previous day's values.

00:00:33.424 --> 00:00:35.324
If this isn't going to work,

00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:38.620
you might try to figure out whether removing this data row,

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:43.144
all together, will have any significant effect on your signal research results.

00:00:43.145 --> 00:00:47.120
You are the one in the best position to make this judgment call.

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:50.039
After all, you know the signal the best.

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.109
If you think the extreme values are due to legit market events,

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:56.670
there are a few different things you should think about.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.010
You might try to find out whether there are many similar occurrences in other stocks.

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:06.920
If there are and if you can identify a common cause for all the extreme values,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.805
you could consider isolating this group of stocks out of the research stock universe.

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:15.990
You should think about what effect this might have on your signal overall.

00:01:15.989 --> 00:01:21.469
Here, we're showing several thinly traded small market cap Asian stocks

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:26.284
experiencing large sudden unpredictable price fluctuations.

00:01:26.284 --> 00:01:29.015
Another type of stock that experiences

00:01:29.015 --> 00:01:32.390
dramatic unpredictable price fluctuations is

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.950
the stock of single drug biotechnology companies.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.500
These type of companies evaluation hinges

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.625
upon the success of various milestones: phase one,two,

00:01:43.625 --> 00:01:48.215
and three drug efficacy trials and FDA approval.

00:01:48.215 --> 00:01:49.850
With only one product,

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:54.854
the company is worth a lot if it is successful and very little if it fails.

00:01:54.855 --> 00:02:01.170
However, the outcome of these binary events is very difficult to predict and to handle.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.719
So, quants frequently exclude these stocks from their trading universes.

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:09.930
As one example, the price of the stock of Sage Theraputics,

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.069
a company that makes a postpartum depression drug,

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.699
jumped from $93 to $167 in

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:21.125
a single day last year when the company announced positive test results.

00:02:21.125 --> 00:02:25.159
You should also think about whether events you think are legitimate are due to

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:29.365
special market events like corporate earnings or central bank announcement's.

00:02:29.365 --> 00:02:34.599
Realistically, if you eventually use this signal to build a trading strategy,

00:02:34.598 --> 00:02:38.209
you might want to think about whether you can avoid these events by,

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.210
for example, pausing the strategy in advance of them.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.370
If it's possible to do this,

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.390
then you can probably remove these rows and proceed with the research.

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:51.949
If you can't pause the strategy ahead of these events,

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:54.259
then you're going to need to think about how you will be able to

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:57.530
avoid losing money when executing this strategy.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.935
As you can see, a lot of this is common sense.

00:03:00.935 --> 00:03:03.485
You'll always need to think about how you can prevent

00:03:03.485 --> 00:03:05.900
the quality of your research results being

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.530
degraded by outliers and how you can avoid losing money when trading your final strategy.
