00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.388
After you calculate returns from a trading signal,

00:00:03.388 --> 00:00:05.969
you may suspect the presence of outliers when you

00:00:05.969 --> 00:00:09.029
examine the distribution of your signal returns.

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:11.199
Let me explain what I mean by that.

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:15.869
Imagine that we've written some code to generate a trading signal and we've

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:21.079
calculated our monthly returns from a couple years of trading based on this signal,

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:25.195
what would we expect the distribution of returns to look like?

00:00:25.195 --> 00:00:30.135
Let's figure out what we would expect to see in a few limiting scenarios.

00:00:30.135 --> 00:00:33.760
What if we picked our buy and sell times at random?

00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:37.619
In that case, we wouldn't expect to make any money because we'll be

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:42.144
equally likely to buy or sell when the market is going up or down.

00:00:42.145 --> 00:00:46.695
We'd expect our returns to have a normal distribution with mean zero,

00:00:46.695 --> 00:00:50.804
but what if we designed a trading strategy that performed well?

00:00:50.804 --> 00:00:55.100
Ideally, if a trading signal looks like it will perform well,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.844
the distribution of its returns should look like

00:00:57.844 --> 00:01:01.274
a slightly positively skewed normal distribution.

00:01:01.274 --> 00:01:03.439
For the signal to make money,

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:06.984
returns should be positive and non-zero on average.

00:01:06.984 --> 00:01:10.420
So, the distributions mean should be above zero.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.879
However, sometimes the return distribution can

00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:17.539
look a little too good or just plain weird.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.440
This should arouse your skepticism.

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:26.030
Extremely skewed shapes or bumps at either tail of the histogram spell trouble.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.079
One tool you can use to compare your distribution of returns to

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:35.060
another distribution like the normal distribution is the QQ plot.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.600
A QQ plot is a plot of the quantiles of

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:42.449
the first data set against the quantiles of the second data set.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.155
What are quantiles?

00:01:44.155 --> 00:01:49.144
Well, if we split a data set into four equally sized groups,

00:01:49.144 --> 00:01:52.524
the dividing lines are at the 25th, 50th,

00:01:52.525 --> 00:01:57.245
and 75th percentiles, these are usually called quartiles.

00:01:57.245 --> 00:02:00.100
The 50th percentile is the median,

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:03.780
the value below which 50% the data fall.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.234
Quartiles divide the data set into four groups,

00:02:07.234 --> 00:02:12.814
but with quantiles, the dataset can be divided into any number of equally-sized groups.

00:02:12.814 --> 00:02:15.539
For example, you could have ten quantiles,

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:17.944
these are usually called deciles.

00:02:17.944 --> 00:02:22.155
The word quantile is usually used to denote the cut points,

00:02:22.155 --> 00:02:25.610
but it's sometimes used to refer to the groups themselves.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.070
Let's get back to the goal of comparing

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.319
your distribution of returns to the normal distribution.

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.959
If you wanted to use QQ plots,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.555
you would first first the set of quantiles you want to use,

00:02:37.555 --> 00:02:43.400
then you would plot the nth quantile of your distribution against the nth quantile of

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.000
the normal distribution and continue for all the values of

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.289
n. If you're comparing your distribution to the normal distribution,

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:54.370
and your distribution is approximately normal,

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.390
points in the QQ plot should fall along a straight line.

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:02.559
If the distribution has fatter tails than the normal distribution,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.444
the QQ plot will reveal deviations from a straight line at the extremities of the graph.

00:03:08.444 --> 00:03:14.579
Distributions with skew will also have QQ plots that curve away from a straight line.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.330
A good quant should try to understand the root cause of outliers and returns.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.880
The first step in dealing with a situation like this is to

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:26.659
find out where and when the outlying data points occurred,

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:30.139
for which stock or stocks and for which dates.

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:32.769
The next step is to ask why.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.780
Depending upon the nature of the extreme data,

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.390
the source might be obvious or less so.

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:40.119
Was it a data error?

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.240
Was an illegitimate movement due to a real event?

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.580
If an extreme datum looks like it could be real,

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.880
you can check the news for the stock on that day.

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:50.314
Was there an announcement?

00:03:50.314 --> 00:03:52.969
You'll want to think of every possibility you can to

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:56.764
explain why this might not be a market data vendor problem.

00:03:56.764 --> 00:04:00.729
A good strategy is to crosscheck with another market data source.
