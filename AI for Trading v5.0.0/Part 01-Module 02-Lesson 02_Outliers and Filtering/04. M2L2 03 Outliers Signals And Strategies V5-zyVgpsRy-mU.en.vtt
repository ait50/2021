00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.419
Thinking about how to deal with Outliers is an important part of signal research.

00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:06.644
Let me give you a couple examples.

00:00:06.644 --> 00:00:10.269
Sometimes, the prices of stocks that aren't traded very

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.494
much undergo dramatic changes when they are actually traded.

00:00:14.494 --> 00:00:16.599
As an example, let's look at

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.625
some small market capitalization stocks traded on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

00:00:21.625 --> 00:00:25.445
One example is Easyknit International Holdings Limited

00:00:25.445 --> 00:00:29.155
which has the ticker symbol 1218.HK.

00:00:29.155 --> 00:00:35.049
I'm using Easyknit as an example of a thinly or infrequently traded stock,

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:37.324
but what does it mean to be thinly traded.

00:00:37.325 --> 00:00:42.790
Well, one way to quantify how much a stock is traded is to look at its typical volume.

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:46.804
This is the number of shares that were traded during a given time period.

00:00:46.804 --> 00:00:50.060
However, the number of shares traded may not tell you very

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.475
much since a company can issue arbitrary numbers of shares.

00:00:53.475 --> 00:00:59.340
A better metric called turnover is the volume traded multiplied by the price per share,

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.750
in other words, the total amount of money that actually

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.719
changed hands when the stock was traded during this period.

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:11.855
This metric is more comparable across companies since it's in units of currency.

00:01:11.855 --> 00:01:14.689
Easyknit's average volume was only about

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.079
10,000 shares at the time we made this video and traded at

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:24.444
around 4.8 Hong Kong dollars for a turnover of around 48,000 Hong Kong dollars.

00:01:24.444 --> 00:01:28.364
For comparison, the turnover of Tencent Holdings,

00:01:28.364 --> 00:01:31.129
a leading provider of Internet related services in

00:01:31.129 --> 00:01:35.399
China and one of the most traded stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange,

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.500
was around five billion Hong Kong dollars.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.765
It doesn't take much trading to move the prices of thinly traded stocks up and down.

00:01:43.765 --> 00:01:47.329
A single trade will cause a significant change in price,

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.075
so the prices can fluctuate unpredictably.

00:01:50.075 --> 00:01:52.079
These fluctuations are real,

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.164
they are due to market activity,

00:01:54.165 --> 00:01:55.900
but they are unpredictable.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.620
You could avoid exposure to

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.704
this unpredictability by excluding these stocks from your trading universe.

00:02:01.704 --> 00:02:05.004
Alternatively, if you want to trade these stocks,

00:02:05.004 --> 00:02:09.799
it might be a good idea to keep these price fluctuations in your trading data in

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.915
order to be sure that your strategy performs well despite this unpredictability.

00:02:14.914 --> 00:02:18.409
This example illustrates why it's important to be careful which

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:22.354
stocks you chose to include in your trading universe in the first place.

00:02:22.354 --> 00:02:25.099
Including data from periods when the market is

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.414
behaving in an unusual way can skew your signals.

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:31.609
For example, during and after market crashes,

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.520
stock prices are volatile and can reach extreme values.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.550
Because market crashes do not happen often,

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.719
they are statistically infrequent outlying events.

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:45.979
If we calibrate trading signals including data from these periods,

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:48.769
the results will be highly skewed and the signals

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.800
won't perform optimally on normal trading days,

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.939
in other words, most of the time.

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:58.159
But if we don't include such periods when calibrating trading signals,

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:00.204
and one of these rare events happens,

00:03:00.205 --> 00:03:04.405
the signal may perform really poorly or even in a toxic manner.

00:03:04.405 --> 00:03:07.159
There is no golden rule to resolve this,

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:09.889
some traders prefer to alleviate these problems in

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.199
the strategy formulation phase by

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:14.929
controlling the sizes of the long and short positions they

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.710
take and establishing thresholds called stop

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.540
loss levels at which they will exit positions to prevent further losses.

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:26.599
It's also possible to design training strategies that

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.394
attempt to take advantage of sudden extreme price movements.

00:03:30.395 --> 00:03:33.950
People who trade with so-called contrarian strategies

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:36.784
seek to identify sudden price movements or

00:03:36.784 --> 00:03:40.159
dislocations that they think are not justified by

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:43.984
real information or events and therefore won't last,

00:03:43.985 --> 00:03:46.490
and they trade against such movements.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.365
One could try to apply this strategy to data of any level of time resolution,

00:03:51.365 --> 00:03:53.689
but minute level data are more prone to

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:56.859
these sudden movements than daily data or monthly data.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.840
This is a risky strategy,

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.379
it can be difficult to determine whether the price will settle back to where it was,

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:05.199
in which case the trader profits,

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:07.489
or whether the price will continue to move in

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.670
the same direction which would not benefit the trader.
