00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.609
If possible, we'd like to generate

00:00:02.609 --> 00:00:05.759
trading signals that are robust to outlying data points.

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.589
For example, imagine you have an outlier in the closing price time series,

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:12.404
a huge positive spike.

00:00:12.404 --> 00:00:16.710
If you're using a momentum based strategy and your strategies buy or sell

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.065
decision is based solely on individual closing price values,

00:00:21.065 --> 00:00:24.745
then the single value might induce a buy decision.

00:00:24.745 --> 00:00:29.315
If instead you take the moving average of closing prices

00:00:29.315 --> 00:00:34.340
averaged with a fixed duration rolling time window as the input to your signal,

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.640
it will average out that single extreme datum and

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.784
reduce the effect of individual outliers on buy or sell decisions.

00:00:41.784 --> 00:00:45.079
The trade-off here is that your signal actions might be

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.039
generated with a slight delay relative to the stock price movement.

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:53.585
The duration of this delay will depend on the window size you use.

00:00:53.585 --> 00:00:58.160
You can take an analogous approach for portfolio level strategies,

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:02.994
or strategies that are based on the movements of an entire portfolio of stocks,.

00:01:02.994 --> 00:01:07.459
You can average out the extreme movements of individual stocks by basing

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:12.000
your buy or sell decision on the accumulated movements of many stocks,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.215
or even an entire sector.

00:01:14.215 --> 00:01:18.255
This will also reduce the effect of outliers on your signal.

00:01:18.254 --> 00:01:21.019
If you are looking for alternative solutions,

00:01:21.019 --> 00:01:25.894
there have been ongoing efforts from within the industry to incorporate Bayesian methods,

00:01:25.894 --> 00:01:28.655
or machine-learning, into outlier detection.

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:30.960
This is outside the scope of this lesson,

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:33.869
so, we will leave the subject to you to explore.
