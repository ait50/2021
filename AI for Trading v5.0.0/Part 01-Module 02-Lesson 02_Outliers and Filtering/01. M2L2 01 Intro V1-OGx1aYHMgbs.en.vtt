00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.629
Welcome back. In this lesson,

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:05.009
we're going to discuss common sources of Outliers,

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.744
a few ways to spot them and some methods you can use to handle them.

00:00:08.744 --> 00:00:11.084
Outliers can be a real nuisance.

00:00:11.085 --> 00:00:13.070
If not handled intelligently,

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.669
they can make results look better than they really are.

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:19.379
They can lead to false trading signals which when used to

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:23.699
construct trading strategies result in profits and losses that at best,

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.684
differ from simulation results and at worst, are completely negative.

00:00:27.684 --> 00:00:31.239
We don't want that, so let's see what we can do about Outliers.
