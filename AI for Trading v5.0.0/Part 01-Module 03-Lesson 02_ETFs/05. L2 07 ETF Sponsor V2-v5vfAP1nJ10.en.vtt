00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.974
Financial institutions that issue ETFs are called ETF sponsors.

00:00:05.974 --> 00:00:11.059
ETF sponsors could be banks or institutional investment firms.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.335
The largest ETF sponsor is BlackRock's iShares.

00:00:15.335 --> 00:00:18.859
iShares was created by Barclays' Global Investors,

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.719
which in turn was acquired by BlackRock.

00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:23.823
As of early 2018,

00:00:23.824 --> 00:00:29.840
iShares had more than $1.75 trillion of assets under management,

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:34.570
which made up more than one-fourth of BlackRock's total AUM.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.359
The other major players are Vanguard,

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:39.564
State Street Global Advisors,

00:00:39.564 --> 00:00:42.504
Deutsche Bank, and Investgo.

00:00:42.505 --> 00:00:45.410
ETF sponsors, like mutual funds,

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:49.244
earn fees as a percentage of assets under management.

00:00:49.244 --> 00:00:54.959
That is, if an ETF sponsor is managing one billion dollars in investments,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.924
while charging 0.1 percent in fees annually,

00:00:58.924 --> 00:01:02.929
then the ETF sponsor is earning 0.1 percent

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:08.155
times one billion dollars or one million dollars per year.

00:01:08.155 --> 00:01:11.719
ETF fees are much smaller percentages

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:15.194
compared to the fees charged by mutual funds and hedge funds.

00:01:15.194 --> 00:01:21.419
But the large volume of assets invested make ETFs very profitable for ETF sponsors.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.364
The ETF sponsor designs and maintains the ETF portfolio,

00:01:25.364 --> 00:01:28.295
so you can think of them as the fund manager.

00:01:28.295 --> 00:01:32.799
So far, ETFs sound pretty similar to mutual funds.
