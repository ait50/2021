00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.004
For most investors, it's easier to buy Futures contracts that are tied to commodities.

00:00:06.004 --> 00:00:11.219
Buying a futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy or

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.429
sell an asset at a future date and at a fixed price.

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:18.589
If you trade futures directly,

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:20.504
remember to mark your calendar,

00:00:20.504 --> 00:00:23.085
because you'll need to either close the position

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:26.640
or roll it over by the time the contract is due.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.655
Let me explain what it means to close the position in a futures contract.

00:00:31.655 --> 00:00:37.755
Let's say you enter into a futures contract with a farmer to buy one metric ton of cocoa,

00:00:37.755 --> 00:00:39.090
at a fixed price,

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.805
at a fixed date six months from now.

00:00:41.804 --> 00:00:46.204
Since you're buying you are long cocoa futures.

00:00:46.204 --> 00:00:50.750
The farmer who is selling is short cocoa futures.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.789
At that six month date,

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:58.689
you're required to pay cash and the farmer is required to send you one ton of cocoa.

00:00:58.689 --> 00:01:01.784
If you want to close your long position,

00:01:01.784 --> 00:01:06.319
then before the due date you should enter into a short position to

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:11.704
sell one metric ton of cocoa at a fixed price and on the same due date.

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:15.245
There's a commodities exchange that handles the paperwork.

00:01:15.245 --> 00:01:17.975
But, it's as if you paid for a ton of cocoa,

00:01:17.974 --> 00:01:22.250
then immediately sold that cocoa to someone else to get your money back.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.525
So, that was how to close a futures position.

00:01:25.525 --> 00:01:31.260
Rolling over contract is like renewing your gym membership for another six months.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.280
To roll over a futures contract,

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.980
you start by canceling the contract when it's near the due date.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.695
Next, you enter into a new contract to buy cocoa at an even later date,

00:01:43.694 --> 00:01:47.669
such as six months after the original contract due date.
