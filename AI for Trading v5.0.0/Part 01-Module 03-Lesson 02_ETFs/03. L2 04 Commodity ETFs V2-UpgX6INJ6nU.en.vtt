00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.769
If you don't cancel or roll over your futures contract by the due date,

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:06.674
you're obligated to buy the asset.

00:00:06.674 --> 00:00:09.949
Whether it's a barrel of oil or a flock of sheep.

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:14.459
So, imagine that you have bought multiple gold futures contracts,

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.050
that have different due dates.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.140
You'll have to set up a lot of reminders on your calendar,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.585
to help you remember when to roll over or cancel each contract Fortunately,

00:00:24.585 --> 00:00:27.179
there are ETFs that track commodities by

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:30.329
buying and rolling over futures contracts for you.

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:34.710
You can buy shares of a gold ETF and hold it however long you

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.600
wish and save yourself the hassle of managing individual futures contracts.
