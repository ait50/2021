00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.304
Let's see how an AP might seek out arbitrage opportunities with ETFs,

00:00:05.304 --> 00:00:09.559
and how that results in stable pricing of ETF shares.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.679
We'll look at the iShares STOXX Europe 600 Retail ETF,

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:17.704
which tracks eurozone retail companies.

00:00:17.704 --> 00:00:20.754
These include companies such as Inditex,

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:24.524
which sells the Zara clothing line and is based in Spain.

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:27.390
It also includes Henness and Mauritz,

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.740
which sells the H&amp;M clothing line and is based in Sweden.

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:36.354
The iShares STOXX Europe 600 Retail or

00:00:36.354 --> 00:00:41.669
UCITS for short is tradable on the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores,

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.615
which is the the largest stock exchange in Mexico.

00:00:44.615 --> 00:00:49.010
Let's say that the investors in Mexico are very eager to invest in

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:55.559
these European retail companies through ETFs and bid up the price of the ETF shares.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.609
This leads to a discrepancy between

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:02.879
the ETF share price and the underlying prices of the stocks.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.090
We say that the ETF is trading at a premium to the net asset value or

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.230
NAV because it is relatively expensive compared to the underlying stocks.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.005
If the ETF shares were cheaper relative to their NAV,

00:01:17.004 --> 00:01:19.974
we would say that they're trading at a discount.

00:01:19.974 --> 00:01:25.724
Notice that this is the type of mispricing experienced by closed-end mutual funds.

00:01:25.724 --> 00:01:29.839
The actual difference is often referred to as the basis.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:38.754
We use this term because a basis point is defined as 0.01 percent or 1 divided by 10,000.

00:01:38.754 --> 00:01:42.259
Usually, the premium or discount is small

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.070
enough that its unit of measurement is a few basis points.
