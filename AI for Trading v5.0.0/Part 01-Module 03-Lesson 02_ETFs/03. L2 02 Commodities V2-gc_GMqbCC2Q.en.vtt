00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.935
There are some common ways that investors use ETFs,

00:00:03.935 --> 00:00:08.570
and these include investments in commodities or international stocks,

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.109
and also using ETFs for hedging.

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:16.100
Investing in commodities is easier with ETFs.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.855
Commodities are raw materials that are interchangeable and tradable.

00:00:20.855 --> 00:00:24.420
By this, I mean that a commodity such as a barrel

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.865
of oil can be exchanged for another barrel of oil,

00:00:27.864 --> 00:00:30.704
whereas a handmade tailored wedding dress

00:00:30.704 --> 00:00:33.809
cannot be swapped out for another wedding dress.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:39.335
Commodities include energy, such as oil and natural gas; precious metals,

00:00:39.335 --> 00:00:40.920
such as gold and silver;

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.954
and agriculture, such as corn and even cows.

00:00:44.954 --> 00:00:48.640
If you wanted to bet that the price of gold will increase,

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.995
you could buy gold from a jewelry store and hide it under your bed,

00:00:52.994 --> 00:00:56.584
then if the price of gold increased as you expected,

00:00:56.585 --> 00:00:58.600
you could sell it for a profit.
