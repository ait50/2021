00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.569
Let's take a step back and see what we've learned.

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:09.574
We've learned that ETFs charge smaller fees than mutual funds or hedge funds.

00:00:09.574 --> 00:00:15.599
Moreover, ETFs are more efficiently priced than closed-end funds because

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.050
authorized participants use arbitrage to bring

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.210
the ETF share prices in line with the underlying stocks.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.190
We hope you have gained a better understanding of

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.570
how ETFs work as you'll be working on ETFs in your project for this module.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.820
Congrats on making it through this lesson and good luck on the next lesson.
