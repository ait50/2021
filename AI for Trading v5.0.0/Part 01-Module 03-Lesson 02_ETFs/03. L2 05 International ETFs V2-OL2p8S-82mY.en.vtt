00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
Investing internationally is easier with ETFs.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.500
Normally, if you wanted to trade stocks in another country,

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.044
you might set up a brokerage account with a firm in that country.

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:15.900
Also, you would be trading when markets are open in that country's Stock Exchange,

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.984
which is tough if the time zones are different from yours.

00:00:18.984 --> 00:00:24.539
For example, let's say you are in New York and making trading decisions for shares in

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.015
Tencent or China Construction Bank which are listed in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

00:00:30.015 --> 00:00:32.579
Since the time zones are far apart,

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.229
you would be spending your late evenings until early mornings managing your trades.

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:42.189
What if you like having a regular sleep schedule as well as a social life?

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:45.199
Well, financial firms create ETFs for

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.955
international stocks and sell these ETF shares in the local US Stock Exchange.

00:00:49.954 --> 00:00:55.784
For example, BlackRock issues the iShares China Large-Cap ETF,

00:00:55.784 --> 00:00:58.869
which is called FXI for short.

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:04.774
The FXI tracks the 50 largest stocks that are traded in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange,

00:01:04.775 --> 00:01:08.560
including Tencent and China Construction Bank.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.480
So, you can trade at the FXI on the New York Stock Exchange during the day,

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.159
then at night you can get some well-deserved sleep or party with your friends.
