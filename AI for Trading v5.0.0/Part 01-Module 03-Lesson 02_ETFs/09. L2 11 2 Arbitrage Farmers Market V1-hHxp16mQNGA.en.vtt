00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.169
Hi, there.

00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:03.629
Do you remember Betty from module one?

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.195
She used to sell fruit at the local farmers market.

00:00:06.195 --> 00:00:08.625
Hi, Betty. What are you up to these days?

00:00:08.625 --> 00:00:11.339
Hi, Eddy. Well, I've been working as

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:14.445
an investment analyst at a new hedge fund Roulant and partners.

00:00:14.445 --> 00:00:17.350
Well, that's cool. What brings you to the farmers market?

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.830
Well, I like to check out the real-time pricing and

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:22.179
trading that goes on in the farmer's market.

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:25.530
It reminds me of the trading that goes on in the financial markets.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.510
That's an interesting connection.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.510
I noticed that one of the farmers here,

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.355
Brock cells oranges for $1 each while

00:00:33.354 --> 00:00:37.904
another farmer Cindy sells a bag of 10 oranges for $9.

00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:41.990
I was wondering how you look at this pressing from the view of a hedge fund analyst.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.775
Well, I could buy 10 individual oranges from Brock

00:00:45.774 --> 00:00:49.989
at $1 each or I could buy from Cindy and pay $9,

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.310
but still receive 10 oranges.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.920
I've also notice that there are tons of customers

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.740
walking around who want to buy an orange for a dollar.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.410
This looks like an opportunity for arbitrage.

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:02.629
Can you walk me through what you would do?

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.370
Sure. In general, I like to buy low and sell high.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.480
So, I'd like to buy a bag of 10 oranges for $9 and then sell them for a dollar each.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.015
I also want to make sure that I don't get stuck holding the bag.

00:01:15.015 --> 00:01:18.189
How would you avoid getting stuck holding a bag of oranges?

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.814
Well, first I'll try to find 10 customers who want an orange.

00:01:21.814 --> 00:01:25.745
At the same time I'll make an agreement with Cindy to buy the bag.

00:01:25.745 --> 00:01:29.005
So, you're buying and selling at the same time.

00:01:29.004 --> 00:01:33.334
Exactly, and I earned a dollar profit by using arbitrage.

00:01:33.334 --> 00:01:37.489
So, now the question is what will you do with your $1 in profit?

00:01:37.489 --> 00:01:42.329
Well, I'm starting to feel a little bit hungry, I think I'll buy an apple.
