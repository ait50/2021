00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.384
You may be wondering why an AP would bother creating or redeeming ETF shares.

00:00:05.384 --> 00:00:07.919
After all, what's in it for them?

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.794
Do they charge a percentage fee the way an ETF sponsor does?

00:00:11.794 --> 00:00:16.939
No, but they do find other ways to make the transaction worth their while.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.290
This benefits investors too,

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.518
because the actions of the AP helped to align

00:00:22.518 --> 00:00:26.479
ETF share prices with the stocks that they represent.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.539
Before we go into how this happens,

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.140
let's review the concept of arbitrage.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.200
Arbitrage is the act of buying and selling assets that

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.594
should be of the same value but that are priced differently in the market.

00:00:40.594 --> 00:00:43.384
When an investor finds a price difference

00:00:43.384 --> 00:00:46.439
between two assets that should be interchangeable,

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:49.924
then they can buy the cheaper one and simultaneously

00:00:49.924 --> 00:00:54.429
sell the more expensive one and make a profit on the difference.
