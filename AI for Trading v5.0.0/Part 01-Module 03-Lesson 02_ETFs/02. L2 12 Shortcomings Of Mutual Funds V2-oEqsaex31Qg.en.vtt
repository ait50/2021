00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.615
Recall that there are some shortcomings in Open-End and Closed-End Mutual funds.

00:00:05.615 --> 00:00:09.629
Open-End Mutual Funds may need to maintain parts of their assets under

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.420
management in cash to let investors withdraw on any given day.

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:17.649
This dilutes the funds overall performance.

00:00:17.649 --> 00:00:21.239
Also, Open-End Mutual Funds may limit the number of

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:25.254
times that you can invest or withdraw within a certain time period,

00:00:25.254 --> 00:00:26.945
such as 90 days.

00:00:26.945 --> 00:00:30.170
Moreover, the price you get for withdrawing is

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.320
based on the closing price at the end of that day,

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.734
not the best price at the time that you initiate the transaction.

00:00:37.734 --> 00:00:40.759
Closed-End Mutual Funds addressed this

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:43.634
by making their shares tradeable in the stock market.

00:00:43.634 --> 00:00:49.129
But the market value of these shares may diverge from the value of the funds portfolio.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.315
Is it possible to do better?

00:00:51.314 --> 00:00:55.759
Can we set up a fund that does not need to hold a reserve of cash and

00:00:55.759 --> 00:01:00.784
whose market value matches is portfolio? Yes we can.

00:01:00.784 --> 00:01:04.174
We can do better than mutual funds with ETFs.

00:01:04.174 --> 00:01:06.515
ETFs like mutual funds,

00:01:06.515 --> 00:01:09.245
allow us to invest in a portfolio of stocks.

00:01:09.245 --> 00:01:12.005
Thereby benefiting from diversification.

00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:18.369
Even better, ETFs shares can be traded on a stock exchange as if their stocks themselves.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:25.010
Plus, the market price of an ETF closely follows the value of the underlying portfolio.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.620
We'll see why later in this lesson.
