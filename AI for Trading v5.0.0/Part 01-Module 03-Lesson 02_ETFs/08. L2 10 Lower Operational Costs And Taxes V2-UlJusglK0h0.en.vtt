00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
Recall earlier that we mentioned how ETF sponsors are more tax efficient

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.740
and that their transactions are not taxed as much compared to traditional mutual funds.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.289
One reason is that ETF sponsors do not deal directly in cash.

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.804
During ETF share creation,

00:00:18.804 --> 00:00:24.629
an ETF sponsor creates shares and receives a bundle of stocks of equal value.

00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:28.799
Similarly during the redemption process the sponsor gives

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.585
a bundle of stocks in exchange for ETF shares of equal value.

00:00:33.585 --> 00:00:36.140
Since the two items being exchanged are of

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.640
the same value there's no capital gain that is recorded.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.140
This is important because capital gains are taxed by the government.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.814
We can contrast this with an open-end mutual fund.

00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:51.379
If an investor requests to withdraw their investment

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.429
the mutual fund may need to sell some stocks for cash to give to

00:00:55.429 --> 00:01:01.700
the investor the capital gains taxes on the stock sales add to the operational costs of

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.880
the fund and these costs are reflected

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.259
in the higher fees that the mutual fund charges investors.
