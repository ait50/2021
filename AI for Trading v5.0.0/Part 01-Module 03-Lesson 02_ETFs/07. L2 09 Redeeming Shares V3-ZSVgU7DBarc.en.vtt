00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
If investors hold ETF shares and want their money back,

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.109
they just sell their shares on the stock exchange.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.009
There's no need for them to interact with ETF sponsor.

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:13.164
For reasons we'll see soon,

00:00:13.164 --> 00:00:19.739
an AP may decide to redeem ETF shares for the original portfolio of stocks.

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:21.739
This is essentially reversing

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:27.594
the original ETF share creation process and is called, the redeem process.

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:33.384
So, the AP buys ETF shares from investors in the stock market.

00:00:33.384 --> 00:00:35.899
Then, the AP trades

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.964
the ETF shares with the ETF sponsor in exchange for the original stocks.

00:00:40.965 --> 00:00:45.565
Then, the AP sells these stocks on the stock exchange.

00:00:45.564 --> 00:00:48.570
This is called the redeem process,

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.884
because the AP redeems the original basket of stocks by trading in the ETF shares.

00:00:54.884 --> 00:00:58.129
Notice, that the redeem process effectively

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.929
reduces the number of ETF shares in the open market.
