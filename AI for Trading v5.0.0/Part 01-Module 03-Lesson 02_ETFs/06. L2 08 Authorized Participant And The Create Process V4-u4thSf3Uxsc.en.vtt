00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.695
Now, here's where ETFs start to look different from mutual funds.

00:00:04.695 --> 00:00:06.839
Recall that with mutual funds,

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.810
investors give their cash to a mutual fund and

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.345
the mutual fund then invest that cash in a portfolio of stocks.

00:00:14.345 --> 00:00:19.050
With ETFs, the ETF sponsor only makes transactions with

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.214
special partners called authorized participants or APs for short.

00:00:25.214 --> 00:00:28.390
Major APs include Merrill Lynch,

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.539
Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Fortis Bank.

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:36.320
An AP goes to the stock market and buys stocks

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.414
that match the portfolio defined by the ETF sponsor.

00:00:40.414 --> 00:00:44.304
Then, the AP makes a trade with the sponsor.

00:00:44.304 --> 00:00:47.810
The sponsor creates ETF shares and gives

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.789
those shares to the AP in exchange for the bundle of stocks.

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:57.615
Notice that the sponsor issues ETF shares similar to what a mutual fund does.

00:00:57.615 --> 00:01:00.950
The difference is that the sponsor only deals with

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.385
a set of APs who are financial institutions.

00:01:04.385 --> 00:01:07.285
Also, unlike a mutual fund,

00:01:07.284 --> 00:01:12.185
the ETF sponsor doesn't receive cash in exchange for its shares.

00:01:12.185 --> 00:01:15.140
Instead, the sponsor receives a bundle of

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.349
stocks that matched the portfolio designed by the sponsor.

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:23.984
Okay, so what do APs do with their ETF shares?

00:01:23.984 --> 00:01:29.840
Also, so far, the investors haven't been involved in any of the transactions.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.990
How do investors get in on some of the action and own some ETF shares for themselves?

00:01:35.989 --> 00:01:42.544
Well, the APs go to the stock exchange and sell their ETF shares on the open market.

00:01:42.545 --> 00:01:46.668
Investors can buy these shares and now have investments

00:01:46.668 --> 00:01:51.450
that are linked to all of the stocks that are in the ETF portfolio.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.075
What we've described so far is called the create process.

00:01:56.075 --> 00:02:00.314
In summary, the create process involves these steps.

00:02:00.314 --> 00:02:05.504
The AP buys stocks and gives them to the ETF sponsor.

00:02:05.504 --> 00:02:11.289
The ETF sponsor creates ETF shares and gives them to the AP.

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:15.810
The AP then sells the ETF shares to investors.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.370
This is called the create process because it effectively

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.020
creates more ETF shares that are available on the stock exchange.
