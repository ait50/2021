00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.605
Now, let's discuss how investors can use ETFs for hedging.

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:08.070
Recall that hedging generally means entering into

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:13.185
a transaction in order to reduce exposure to price fluctuations.

00:00:13.185 --> 00:00:16.975
Let's see how hedging works with ETFs.

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:21.790
If you have a portfolio that holds many stocks in the S&amp;P 500,

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:27.789
you can take some short positions in an ETF that tracks the S&amp;P 500.

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.619
The most popular is the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF,

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.059
which is issued by State Street Global Advisors.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.875
Note that it's spelled S-P-D-R and pronounced spider.

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:44.554
When the overall market moves down,

00:00:44.554 --> 00:00:46.950
your portfolio goes down with it.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.429
However, your short positions in

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:55.134
the SPDR ETF gain at the same time limiting the impact of the market downturn.

00:00:55.134 --> 00:00:59.449
Note that the reverse happens when the market goes up.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.400
Your long investments will go up with a market,

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.700
while your short positions in the ETF will lose reducing your net gain.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.870
Active fund managers may also short ETFs in order to reduce

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.910
their portfolio's exposure to certain sectors, industries, or regions.

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:23.364
For example, a hedge fund whose portfolio includes tech stocks may wish to short an ETF,

00:01:23.364 --> 00:01:27.814
such as the Fidelity MSCI Information Tech ETF,

00:01:27.814 --> 00:01:32.799
in order to cancel out some of the price fluctuations in the tech industry.
