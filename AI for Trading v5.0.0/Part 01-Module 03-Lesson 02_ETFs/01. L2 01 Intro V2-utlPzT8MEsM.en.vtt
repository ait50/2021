00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.379
In this lesson, we'll introduce Exchange Traded Funds or ETFs,

00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:08.495
and get an understanding of how ETFs work.

00:00:08.494 --> 00:00:13.219
ETFs are considered a significant innovation in finance.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.950
One might say that ETFs did for the financial services industry,

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.859
what smartphones did for the tech industry.

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:23.239
As the introduction of ETFs led to

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:26.924
evermore products that customers just couldn't get enough of.

00:00:26.925 --> 00:00:32.899
The world's first ETF was created by the Toronto Stock Exchange in Canada in 1990.

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.939
The market value of ETFs in the US market grew from $100 billion in

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:43.530
the early 2000s to $3.4 trillion by 2017.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.219
Globally there are about $4.5 trillion invested in ETFs.

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:55.269
Broadly speaking, as ETFs have gained popularity due to their low fees and accessibility,

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.740
they've been taking market share from traditional mutual funds.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.405
ETFs have lower fees because they have lower operational costs,

00:01:03.405 --> 00:01:06.650
and their transactions are structured in a way that can avoid

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.620
some of the taxes that traditional mutual funds normally pay.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.885
The lower operational costs are usually due to passive investment management,

00:01:15.885 --> 00:01:21.055
which requires less frequent trading and therefore lower transaction costs.

00:01:21.055 --> 00:01:27.690
We will point out other cost savings as we cover more details about how ETFs works.
