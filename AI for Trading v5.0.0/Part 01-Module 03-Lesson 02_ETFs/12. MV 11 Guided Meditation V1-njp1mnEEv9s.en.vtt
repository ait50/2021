00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
We're going to take a minute to let our brains chill out.

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.890
Learning requires active engagement of your brain and really your whole self,

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:09.719
and research shows that giving yourself adequate time to

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.679
rest and recuperate helps your new knowledge put down roots,

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.879
so you can use it effectively in the future.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.490
Getting enough sleep, spacing your learning out throughout

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:20.619
your weekly schedule rather than trying to do it all in one chunk,

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.580
and giving yourself permission to take a break when you feel tired or

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:28.059
frustrated can all help you maintain your motivation and your brain's learning readiness.

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:30.254
Meditating is another great way to take

00:00:30.254 --> 00:00:33.119
a mental break from learning indirect the world at large.

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:35.689
So, let's try it out, nothing to lose.

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:37.189
Wherever you are right now,

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:39.899
find a comfortable position to sit or stand in.

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.740
Try to let your whole body relax,

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.730
and others can be a little bit tricky especially when you've

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:46.399
been leaning in a very active way.

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.445
But just start by relaxing your hands and your feet,

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:51.670
let your arms and your legs relax,

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:52.859
let your belly relax,

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:55.939
let your shoulders roll up back and down,

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:58.549
close your eyes or you can pick a spot right in

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:01.849
front of you to just stare at in a more static way.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.359
Then just start to let your thoughts about

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:09.284
your learning and whatever else is going on in your life fade away.

00:01:09.284 --> 00:01:11.739
If it's hard to just let your brain empty itself,

00:01:11.739 --> 00:01:14.134
you can instead replace those thoughts about

00:01:14.135 --> 00:01:17.785
anything that's going on with instead thoughts about your breath.

00:01:17.784 --> 00:01:23.674
So, to start to tune into how your body is naturally breathing on its own,

00:01:23.674 --> 00:01:28.200
just noticing what it feels like to inhale and what it feels like to exhale.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.609
Maybe you're breathing more into your chest,

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:33.939
maybe you're breathing more into your belly.

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.030
Feel how your rib cage expands out in all directions as you breathe

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.665
in and then contracts back to the center as you breathe out.

00:01:42.665 --> 00:01:45.755
You don't have to control your breath anyway,

00:01:45.754 --> 00:01:49.524
it's something that your body is just doing automatically on its own.

00:01:49.525 --> 00:01:52.680
Or just a couple of moments here,

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.285
noticing that breath being still,

00:01:55.284 --> 00:01:59.030
being quiet, and just

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.560
focusing on this emptiness instead of everything else that's going on outside of you.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.569
Then you can gently blink your eyes open if you close them.

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.794
So, congratulations, you just meditated.

00:03:05.794 --> 00:03:07.549
This is something that you can use throughout

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.160
your learning experience using this video or on your own,

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:12.229
and you can take it into the rest of your life as well whenever you

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:15.139
need a moment just to ground yourself and feel a little bit more calm.

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:19.079
So, I hope this was helpful and congratulations on trying something new.
