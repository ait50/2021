00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
Going back to the example with the UCITS ETF,

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.925
the demand for the ETF has led to a premium on the ETF shares.

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:15.025
An AP such as Morgan Stanley may see this price difference as an arbitrage opportunity.

00:00:15.025 --> 00:00:19.004
So, the AP triggers the create process,

00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:23.640
that is Morgan Stanley may buy shares in Inditex,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.660
H&amp;M, and all the other companies listed in the UCITS ETF.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.634
Then, the AP gives the bundle of stocks to the ETF sponsor,

00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:36.034
which is BlackRock's iShares.

00:00:36.034 --> 00:00:40.489
The ETF sponsor issues more ETF shares for the AP.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.920
The AP, Morgan Stanley,

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.535
then sells the ETF shares to investors on the stock exchange,

00:00:46.534 --> 00:00:49.294
which is the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores.

00:00:49.295 --> 00:00:54.475
The create process injects more ETF shares into the marketplace.

00:00:54.475 --> 00:01:00.460
The large purchases of a company stocks push up the stock prices of Inditex,

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.394
H&amp;M, and the other European retail stocks listed in the UCITS ETF.

00:01:06.394 --> 00:01:13.625
Moreover, the additional supply of ETF shares helps to bring down the price of the ETF.

00:01:13.625 --> 00:01:16.549
The AP profits from the difference between

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:21.274
the buy price of the stocks and the sell price of the ETF shares.

00:01:21.275 --> 00:01:27.855
As long as there is a price discrepancy that is large enough for arbitrage opportunities,

00:01:27.855 --> 00:01:33.930
APs will buy low and sell high until the prices are aligned.
