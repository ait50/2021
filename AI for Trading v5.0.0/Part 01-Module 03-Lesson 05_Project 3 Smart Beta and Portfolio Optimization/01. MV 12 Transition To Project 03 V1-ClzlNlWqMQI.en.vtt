00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080
Congratulations, you're more than halfway through term one.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.580
You've done amazingly well to get this far.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.830
You've learned the basic mechanics of stock markets,

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.280
the fundamental math and vocabulary that people use to describe markets,

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:15.559
and a few types of trading strategies based on basic hypotheses about market behavior.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.635
This means that you're ready for a new exciting challenge.

00:00:18.635 --> 00:00:21.655
In this project there are two parts,

00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:25.160
in the first part you'll build a smart beta portfolio,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.554
then calculate the tracking error against its index.

00:00:28.554 --> 00:00:30.030
In the second part,

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.120
you will re-balance the portfolio using

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.089
quadratic programming and calculate its turnover to evaluate the performance.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.390
The project will give you practical experience with the idea of smart beta,

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.730
a popular type of investment strategy that

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:46.449
you'll hear about when discussing quantitative trading,

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.179
and enable you to practice the math of portfolio optimization,

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:53.594
which is something you would do frequently as a quantitative analyst.

00:00:53.594 --> 00:00:56.199
Best of luck with this project. It's a good one.
