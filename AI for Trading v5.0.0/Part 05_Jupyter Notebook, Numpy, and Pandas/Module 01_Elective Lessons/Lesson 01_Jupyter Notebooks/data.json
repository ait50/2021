              "text": "# What are Jupyter notebooks?\n\nWelcome to this lesson on using [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks. The notebook is a web application that allows you to combine explanatory text, math equations, code, and visualizations all in one easily sharable document. For example, here's one of my favorite notebooks shared recently, the analysis of [gravitational waves from two colliding blackholes](https://losc.ligo.org/s/events/GW150914/GW150914_tutorial.html) detected by the [LIGO experiment](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20160211). You could download the data, run the code in the notebook, and repeat the analysis, in effect detecting the gravitational waves yourself!\n\nNotebooks have quickly become an essential tool when working with data. You'll find them being used for [data cleaning and exploration](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jmsteinw/Notebooks/blob/master/IndeedJobs.ipynb), visualization, [machine learning](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/masinoa/machine_learning/blob/master/04_Neural_Networks.ipynb), and [big data analysis](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tdhopper/rta-pyspark-presentation/blob/master/slides.ipynb). Here's [an example notebook](https://github.com/mcleonard/blog_posts/blob/master/body_fat_percentage.ipynb) I made for my personal blog that shows off many of the features of notebooks. Typically you'd be doing this work in a terminal, either the normal Python shell or with IPython. Your visualizations would be in separate windows, any documentation would be in separate documents, along with various scripts for functions and classes. However, with notebooks, all of these are in one place and easily read together.\n\nNotebooks are also rendered automatically on GitHub. It’s a great feature that lets you easily share your work. There is also http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ that renders the notebooks from your GitHub repo or from notebooks stored elsewhere.   ",

With literate programming, the documentation is written as a narrative alongside the code instead of sitting off by its own. In Donald Knuth's words, \n\n> Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.\n\nAfter all, code is written for humans, not for computers. Notebooks provide exactly this capability. You are able to write documentation as narrative text, along with code. This is not only useful for the people reading your notebooks, but for your future self coming back to the analysis. \n\nJust a small aside: recently, this idea of literate programming has been extended to a whole programming language, [Eve](http://www.witheve.com/).",

IPython is an interactive shell, similar to the normal Python shell but with great features like syntax highlighting and code completion. Originally, notebooks worked by sending messages from the web app (the notebook you see in the browser) to an IPython kernel (an IPython application running in the background). The kernel executed the code, then sent it back to the notebook.  The current architecture is similar, drawn out below.",

              "text": "The central point is the notebook server. You connect to the server through your browser and the notebook is rendered as a web app. Code you write in the web app is sent through the server to the kernel. The kernel runs the code and sends it back to the server, then any output is rendered back in the browser. When you save the notebook, it is written to the server as a JSON file with a `.ipynb` file extension.\n\nThe great part of this architecture is that the kernel doesn't need to run Python. Since the notebook and the kernel are separate, code in any language can be sent between them. For example, two of the earlier non-Python kernels were for the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Julia](http://julialang.org/) languages. With an R kernel, code written in R will be sent to the R kernel where it is executed, exactly the same as Python code running on a Python kernel. IPython notebooks were renamed because notebooks became language agnostic. The new name **Jupyter** comes from the combination of **Ju**lia, **Pyt**hon, and **R**. If you're interested, here's a [list of available kernels](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels).\n\nAnother benefit is that the server can be run anywhere and accessed via the internet. Typically you'll be running the server on your own machine where all your data and notebook files are stored. But, you could also [set up a server](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/public_server.html) on a remote machine or cloud instance like Amazon's EC2. Then, you can access the notebooks in your browser from anywhere in the world.  ",

By default, the notebook server runs at `http://localhost:8888`. If you aren't familiar with this, `localhost` means your computer and `8888` is the port the server is communicating on. As long as the server is still running, you can always come back to it by going to http://localhost:8888 in your browser.\n\nIf you start another server, it'll try to use port `8888`, but since it is occupied, the new server will run on port `8889`. Then, you'd connect to it at `http://localhost:8889`.

The `escape` key changes to command mode and `s` is the shortcut for \"save.\" I'll cover command mode and keyboard shortcuts later.\n\nIn the \"File\" menu, you can download the notebook in multiple formats. You'll often want to download it as an HTML file to share with others who aren't using Jupyter. Also, you can download the notebook as a normal Python file where all the code will run like normal. The [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and [reST](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) formats are great for using notebooks in blogs or documentation. ",

Including text allows you to write a narrative alongside your code, as well as documenting your code and the thoughts that went into it.\n\nYou can find the [documentation here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics), but I'll provide a short primer.\n\n## Headers\n\nYou can write headers using the pound/hash/[octothorpe](http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-oct1.htm) symbol `#` placed before the text. One `#` renders as an `h1` header, two `#`s is an h2, and so on. Looks like this:\n\n```[Markdown]\n# Header 1\n## Header 2\n### Header 3\n```\nrenders as \n\n# Header 1\n## Header 2\n### Header 3",

For example, you can set up matplotlib to work interactively in the notebook with `%matplotlib`.\n\nMagic commands are preceded with one or two percent signs (`%` or `%%`) for line magics and cell magics, respectively. Line magics apply only to the line the magic command is written on, while cell magics apply to the whole cell.\n\n**NOTE:** These magic keywords are specific to the normal Python kernel. If you are using other kernels, these most likely won't work.\n\n## Timing code\n\nAt some point, you'll probably spend some effort optimizing code to run faster. Timing how quickly your code runs is essential for this optimization. You can use the `timeit` magic command to time how long it takes for a function to run, like so:\n\n\n\n",

This is most useful when you’re using `matplotlib` or other plotting packages to create visualizations. You can use `%matplotlib` to set up `matplotlib` for interactive use in the notebook. By default figures will render in their own window. However, you can pass arguments to the command to select a specific [\"backend\"](http://matplotlib.org/faq/usage_faq.html#what-is-a-backend), the software that renders the image. To render figures directly in the notebook, you should use the inline backend with the command `%matplotlib inline`.\n\n> **Tip:** On higher resolution screens such as Retina displays, the default images in notebooks can look blurry. Use `%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'` after `%matplotlib inline` to render higher resolution images.\n",

Making good use of Anaconda and Jupyter Notebooks will increase your productivity and general well-being. There is a lot to learn to get the most out of these, Markdown and LaTeX for instance, but after a bit you'll be wondering why data analysis is done any other way.\n\nAgain, congratulations and good luck!",
